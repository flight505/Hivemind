using Parallelized tree search & cyclic self-reflection
code in comment

It uses a Parallelized Tree Search algorithm where each "node" represents a different predictor function,

and the system intelligently explores the space of possible functions while using cyclic memory
and self-reflection  to find the most accurate one.

the system creates Python functions that can predict categorical outputs (1, 2, 3, 4) based on 5 numerical inputs (A, B, C, D, E).
