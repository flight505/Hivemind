Strategic reflection — summary and concrete plan for Cycle 3

Summary context
- Cycle 2 improved to a best of 56.43% (avg 51.22%) over 10 iterations, with 3 cross-cycle examples preserved. The current best function is heavily rule/threshold driven and mixes memorized exact rows with many hand-tuned thresholds and a weighted fallback score.
- That approach found several useful heuristics (sums, strong pair interactions, dominance margins) but still struggles with many ambiguous, mid-range, and multi-signal cases. We should move from brittle hand-tuning toward more robust, systematic features and a small learned/ensemble decision layer.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Aggregate mass (sum s, or partial sums like A+B or A+B+C) is a consistent signal: very large totals trend to class 1.
- Pairwise strong interactions matter—especially C with D (C high and D high → class 1) and A with D (A large with very large D → sometimes class 3).
- Dominance and margin features (max value, second max, and E’s margin over the next-best) are predictive: a dominant E often yields class 4 unless overridden by strong C/D.
- Specific value windows for single features: very large E → 4 (with some C/D overrides); tiny E → special handling; very large B with decent C → class 2.
- A simple weighted linear combination (score) is a useful fallback when other rules don’t fire.

2) Failure analysis (what remains challenging)
- Ambiguous mid-range inputs where several features are moderate (no clear dominant signal). The rules frequently conflict and lead to wrong ties.
- Boundary/threshold sensitivity: many correct examples are near thresholds, so small threshold changes flip decisions (overfitting to thresholds).
- Multi-factor tradeoffs: cases where moderate C and moderate D plus high B or moderate A produce different labels depending on subtle interactions not captured by single thresholds.
- Overreliance on memorized exact rows and hand-designed special cases makes generalization weaker on novel combinations.
- Rare pattern signals (e.g., parity, digit patterns, or non-linear transforms) not yet explored – these can be highly informative but are missed by linear/threshold rules.

3) Innovation opportunities (unexplored / underexplored)
- Relative and normalized features: ranks (1st, 2nd), gaps between top two, z-score style normalization relative to sum or max.
- Pairwise non-linear interactions: products, ratios, and squared/cubic terms (e.g., A*C, B/D, A/B), which can capture multiplicative synergy or dilution effects.
- Digit- and bit-level encodings: last digit, tens place, parity, bitwise AND/XOR—useful if label correlates with numeric patterns rather than magnitudes.
- Soft-scoring / ensemble voting: combine multiple weak rules with weights or probabilities rather than strict if-else cascades. This reduces brittleness at thresholds.
- Local similarity / nearest-neighbor fallback: use preserved training examples and a small distance metric (e.g., weighted Euclidean) when overall signal is weak.
- Automated threshold tuning: treat thresholds as tunable parameters and perform small search/grid optimization on held-out examples instead of manually setting them.

4) Strategic direction (priority for next cycle)
Prioritize methods that increase robustness and capture non-linear interactions while keeping interpretability:
1. Create rank-gap and dominance-based rules with dynamic thresholds (based on sums or percentiles), to replace brittle fixed margins.
2. Introduce pairwise product/ratio features and test simple linear classifiers (logistic regression or weighted voting) on those features to capture multiplicative interactions.
3. Add digit-level / modulo features as a small feature bank to catch discrete patterns the current numeric heuristics miss.
4. Move from hard cascaded rules to a hybrid soft voting ensemble: several rule groups produce votes and a weighted sum decides the label; tune weights automatically.
5. Keep a small local nearest-neighbor memory of cross-cycle examples and use it when the ensemble confidence is low.

Creative planning — 4 specific strategies to explore in Cycle 3

Strategy A — Rank-gap dominance + percentile thresholds (high priority)
- New operations/features:
  - Compute ranks of A–E (rank 1..5), gap = top_value - second_value, gap_ratio = gap / top_value.
  - Normalized value = value / sum (or value / max).
  - Percentile thresholds: derive thresholds relative to sample distribution (e.g., top 10%).
- Logical structure:
  - Use rules based on rank and gap_ratio instead of absolute margins. Example: if E is rank 1 and gap_ratio ≥ 0.20 → label 4; but if C is rank 1 and gap_ratio ≥ 0.20 → label 2 (unless D also high).
  - Make rank-based tie-breakers: when two top ranks are close, prefer label tied to second feature if product interactions indicate so.
- Handling ambiguous inputs:
  - If no dominant rank (gap_ratio small), defer to soft ensemble of other features (Strategy D) or nearest-neighbor.
- Novel interactions:
  - Combine normalized ranks with partial sums (A+B normalized) to detect when a pair collectively dominates even if neither alone is rank 1.

Strategy B — Pairwise multiplicative and ratio features + small linear classifier
- New operations/features:
  - Pairwise products: A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D.
  - Ratios: A/B, B/A, C/(A+1), D/(sum- D + 1) — clipped to reasonable ranges.
  - Squared features (C^2) for strong-C nonlinearity.
- Logical structure:
  - Build a lightweight scoring model: assign weights to these features (tunable) and compute class-specific scores (one-vs-rest style). Use highest score as prediction.
  - Or use a single linear model (logistic/regression-like) per class with calibrated thresholds learned on held-out examples.
- Handling ambiguous inputs:
  - Multiplicative terms reveal synergy that thresholds miss (e.g., moderate C and D multiply to strong signal).
  - Use classifier confidence: if class scores are close, escalate to nearest-neighbor check.
- Novel interactions:
  - Explicitly test combinations like (A*C) vs (B*D) to differentiate label-driving synergies.

Strategy C — Digit-level and modular features (medium priority)
- New operations/features:
  - last_digit(x) = x % 10, tens_digit = (x // 10) % 10, parity = x % 2.
  - sum_of_digits, product_of_digits, gcd of feature pairs (small).
  - bitwise patterns (x & y), or x XOR y for few trials.
- Logical structure:
  - Create a small rule bank: if many features share same last digit or parity pattern, map to an observed label.
  - Use these only after magnitude-based rules fail; they become a tiebreaker against ambiguous mid-range numeric signals.
- Handling ambiguous inputs:
  - For examples where numeric magnitude rules are inconclusive, test digit-pattern rules and, if confident, return label; otherwise fallback to ensemble.
- Novel interactions:
  - Combine digit features with rank features, e.g., “If feature_rank1_last_digit == feature_rank2_last_digit and gap_ratio small → label X”.

Strategy D — Soft ensemble / weighted voting + confidence gating (high priority)
- New operations/features:
  - Create multiple independent voting modules: (1) sum/threshold module, (2) rank-gap module (A), (3) pairwise-product classifier (B), (4) digit-pattern module (C), (5) memorized nearest-neighbor module.
  - Each module outputs a vote vector [score_1..score_4] or class probabilities.
- Logical structure:
  - Combine votes with weights to compute an overall score for each class. If max score sufficiently above second (confidence margin), return that class.
  - If low confidence, fallback to nearest-neighbor or explicit hand-tuned tie-breaker.
  - Treat weights as tunable parameters and optimize on preserved cross-cycle examples and a small validation set.
- Handling ambiguous inputs:
  - Ensemble smooths over single rules’ brittleness; when rules disagree the decision will reflect consensus or defer to local memory.
- Novel interactions:
  - Allow modules to have conditional activation (e.g., product module only active if both features > 20) to reduce noise.

Strategy E — Local similarity and automated threshold tuning (supporting strategy)
- New operations/features:
  - Weighted distance metric: dist(x, y) = sum w_i * |x_i - y_i| after normalization. Maintain preserved examples.
  - Grid search or simple hill-climb to tune thresholds and module weights on a validation set.
- Logical structure:
  - If ensemble confidence < threshold, pick the preserved example with smallest dist; return its label (nearest-neighbor fallback).
  - Use automated tuning to set rank-gap ratio cutoffs, product thresholds, and ensemble weights.
- Handling ambiguous inputs:
  - Nearest-neighbor handles edge cases where the global rules are inconclusive but an exact or similar training instance exists.
- Novel interactions:
  - Use learned weights in distance metric that reflect feature importance discovered by pairwise classifier.

Evaluation plan and implementation notes
- Prioritize implementing Strategy A, B, and D early: they address the biggest failure modes (ambiguous mid-range inputs, non-linear interactions, brittle thresholds).
- Reserve Strategy C (digit-level) experiments for a small subset of runs—cheap to compute and can reveal unexpected discrete patterns.
- Use a small validation split of preserved examples for automated tuning; keep at least a few examples aside to avoid overfitting.
- Track: accuracy, per-class precision/recall, and confidence distribution. Monitor how often nearest-neighbor fallback is used (we want it as safety net, not the main path).
- Keep interpretability: maintain human-readable feature importance and representative example matches for any learned weights.

Concluding recommendation
- Move from brittle hand-coded thresholds toward a hybrid system: robust normalized rank-gap rules + multiplicative features scored by a lightweight classifier, combined in a soft ensemble and backed by a nearest-neighbor memory. This will increase generalization, reduce threshold sensitivity, and allow the system to capture both additive and multiplicative patterns present in the data.
- Begin Cycle 3 by implementing the ensemble skeleton, adding rank-gap features and pairwise multiplicative features, and running quick automated threshold/weight tuning. If those steps improve validation accuracy, iterate with digit-level features and extended tuning.
