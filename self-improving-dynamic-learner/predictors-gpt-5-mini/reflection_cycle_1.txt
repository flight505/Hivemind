================================================================================

High-level takeaway
- Cycle 1 produced a mix of explicit memorization (training rows + many fixes) and hand-crafted heuristics based on large-value thresholds, sums, and a simple weighted score. That got us to ~50% accuracy but shows signs of overfitting to seen examples and brittle threshold rules.
- The most useful signals so far are (a) which variables are very large or very small (extreme thresholds), (b) pairwise sums (A+B, overall sum), and (c) certain strong interactions like high C with low D/E or high D with moderate A. These are good starting points but not yet captured in a robust, generalizable way.

1) Patterns observed
- Extremes drive class decisions: very large E -> class 4; very large C often -> class 2 unless overridden by A or A+B. Very large A+B or overall sum strongly favors class 1.
- Pairwise interactions matter more than single-variable thresholds in many cases: D high + A moderate -> a different class than D high + A low.
- Weighted linear scoring (the custom score at the end) is a reasonable global fallback for many cases, but it misses localized or combinatorial patterns that memorization handled.
- A small set of concrete exception rows required direct fixes: suggests local rule exceptions or a nearest-neighbor / lookup component is useful.

2) Failure analysis (what remains challenging)
- Conflicting signals: rows where different heuristics point to different classes (e.g., C high but A+B high, or E high but small A). Current priority ordering resolves some but not all conflicts.
- Borderline/near-threshold cases: when values are near cutoffs (e.g., C=77–82) the rules flip unpredictably.
- Nonlinear combinatorial patterns: classes that depend on relative ordering (which variable is the max), parity, modular relationships, or ratios are not captured.
- Overfitting to examples: many fixes reduce errors on specific rows but reduce generalization.
- Class-specific subtle patterns: some classes may depend on secondary features (e.g., second-largest value, difference between two variables) rather than absolute magnitude.

3) Innovation opportunities (not yet fully explored)
- Rank/order features: which variable is largest, second largest, etc. Many tasks are easier when expressed in terms of order statistics rather than absolute thresholds.
- Ratios and normalized features: A/(B+1), C/E, (A-B)/(A+B) can reveal relative dominance rather than absolute size.
- Piecewise models / local rules: partition input space (via clustering or simple gating rules) and learn specialized rules per region instead of one global rule list.
- Feature crosses and polynomial features: A*C, (A-B)^2, interactions between binary indicators (A>t and C>u).
- Distance-based lookup: k-NN or nearest training-row voting to reduce brittle manual fixes.
- Lightweight learning models: small decision trees or logistic regressions on engineered features to capture interpretable thresholds automatically.

4) Strategic direction (priorities for next cycle)
1. Reduce memorization reliance: add a small nearest-neighbor fallback and cluster-based local rules so fixes generalize, not just single-row mapping.
2. Add rank/order features and test rules based on argmax/arg2max — these often compress many manual rules into few robust ones.
3. Introduce ratio/normalized features (A/(B+1), C/(A+1), D/sum) to handle conflicting high/low signals.
4. Build a hybrid pipeline: a compact, interpretable model (shallow decision tree or rule learner) trained on engineered features + explicit exception list for true outliers.
5. Systematic error analysis: generate confusion matrices and targeted perturbation tests around threshold boundaries to discover fragile regions.

Creative planning — 4 concrete strategies to explore in Cycle 2

Strategy 1 — Rank-based decision rules (priority)
- New operations: compute the index and value of the max and second-max among {A,B,C,D,E}, and differences max - second_max.
- Logical structure: if max is A and (max - second_max) >= X -> class 1; if max is E and second_max <= Y -> class 4; if C is second_max and B is max -> class 2.
- Handling edge cases: when differences are small (near tie) fall back to ratio or sum-based rules.
- Why: Many existing fixes look like “when a particular variable dominates” — making this explicit should compress many ad-hoc thresholds.

Strategy 2 — Ratio and normalized dominance features
- New operations: ratios A/(B+1), C/(E+1), (A+B)/(C+D+E+1), and normalized variables zi = xi / sum(x).
- Logical structure: treat thresholds on ratios instead of absolutes: e.g., if A/(B+1) >= 2 and A >= 50 -> class 1; if C/(E+1) >= 1.5 and E <= 30 -> class 2.
- Handling challenging patterns: resolves contradictions where both A and C are “high” by expressing relative dominance.
- Why: relative dominance often explains why the same absolute C value maps to different classes.

Strategy 3 — Local-model gating (clustering + per-cluster rules)
- New operations: quick clustering of training rows using simple features (max_index, sum-quantile, parity), or a small decision stump to assign region id.
- Logical structure: gate into region R via simple tests (e.g., E>=80 -> region E-high; else if sum>=220 -> region sum-high; else region mid). For each region, learn compact rules or small decision tree.
- Handling tough inputs: regions capture local regularities so model can have different thresholds per region instead of single global thresholds.
- Why: this reduces conflict between opposing heuristics and avoids exponential rule lists.

Strategy 4 — k-NN + rule hybrid and prioritized memorization
- New operations: compute L1 or L2 distance to stored training/fix examples; a k-NN vote returns a class if nearest neighbor distance <= threshold.
- Logical structure: first check exact/memoized rows; then check k-NN (k small, with distance threshold); if no close neighbor, run rule-based classifier.
- Alternative handling: for borderline regions where rules conflict, use k-NN as tie-breaker; for outliers confidently matched by k-NN return that class.
- Why: avoids excessive single-row fixes while capturing local idiosyncrasies present in training.

Strategy 5 — Compact learnable model on engineered features
- New operations: build a small, interpretable model (depth-3 decision tree or L1-regularized logistic regression) trained on engineered features: ranks, ratios, binary flags (A>t, C<E), pairwise differences, sums.
- Logical structure: keep the model shallow to keep interpretability and to allow hand-editing of few leaf conditions.
- Handling edge cases: train on cross-validated folds of existing examples, and reserve a small explicit-exception list for rare misfits.
- Why: lets training data speak for thresholds and combine signals in a more principled way than manual weight tuning.

Practical steps to implement quickly in Cycle 2
- Generate engineered features for all existing examples: ranked indices, normalized values, pairwise ratios, A+B, total sum, parity bits.
- Fit a shallow decision tree or sparse logistic model on those features to extract candidate rules and thresholds.
- Implement a k-NN with a small threshold as fallback, and keep a small explicit exception dictionary but limit its growth.
- Run focused perturbation tests: vary a single variable across threshold bands to produce confusion maps — use this to refine rank/ratio thresholds.
- Track per-class precision/recall and create targeted mini-strategies for classes with low recall.

Closing note
- The next cycle should move from many handcrafted threshold-order heuristics to a small hybrid system: engineered features (ranks + ratios), small learned interpretable model(s), region-specific rules, and a compact k-NN fallback. That combination addresses brittleness, reduces ad-hoc fixes, and preserves the interpretability that lets us iterate quickly. Prioritize rank-based rules and ratio features first — they are low-cost to implement and likely to yield the largest generalization gains.
