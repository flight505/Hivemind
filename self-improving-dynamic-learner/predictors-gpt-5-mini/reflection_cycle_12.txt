================================================================================

Cycle 12 delivered a modest improvement and useful lessons about which numeric relationships are most informative and where the current heuristic rule set is brittle. Below is a concise strategic reflection and a concrete plan of 4–5 targeted innovations to try next cycle.

High-level summary
- Best accuracy: 55.81%, average: 53.57% across 10 iterations. A few hard-coded training rows are still being memorized (3 cross-cycle examples kept).
- The current heuristics strongly exploit a few reliable signals (C*D multiplicative strength, large A+B or total sum, extreme E behavior and simple dominance comparisons) but struggle in mid-range/tie regions and with overlapping/conflicting signals.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Multiplicative interactions (especially C * D) are a very strong indicator for class 1 in many cases. Large products or both factors high -> class 1 frequently.
- Simple sums and mass (A+B, A+B+C, total sum s) often separate heavy-mass examples (class 1).
- Extreme single-feature dominance (E very high) tends to indicate class 4 unless overridden by strong interactions elsewhere.
- Relative dominance and gaps (top value minus second) are useful: small gaps correlate with ambiguous/tie regions and benefit from a soft scoring approach.
- A weighted linear score (A*0.44 + B*0.3 + ...) worked reasonably well as a fallback.

2) Failure analysis (what still trips the model)
- Mid-range and near-tie examples where no feature strongly dominates — hard thresholds cause brittle decisions.
- Overlapping signals: e.g., B large with moderate C sometimes suggests class 2 but other interactions push to class 1 or 3; current rules collide and produce mislabels.
- Rare edge cases driven by small C but extreme B or D (and exceptions to the “B large → class 1” heuristics).
- Many rules are sharp thresholds producing discontinuities — small perturbations change the class unpredictably.
- Sparse memory: memorizing a handful of samples helps but we need generalizable local interpolation rather than exact matches.

3) Innovation opportunities (not fully explored)
- Smooth, continuous scoring (sigmoid/scores → probabilities) instead of hard thresholds; multiclass scoring functions.
- Feature engineering: systematic inclusion of pairwise products, ratios (A/B, B/A, C/D), normalized features (feature/max, feature/sum), powers (squares), and transforms (log1p, sqrt).
- Local interpolation / similarity-based predictions (k-nearest prototypes) using standardized distances rather than only global rules.
- Mixture-of-experts: several specialized rule modules (high-C expert, high-E expert, tie-region expert) combined by a gating function.
- Lightweight parameter tuning: treat coefficients in scoring functions as small parameter vectors and tune them via grid search on preserved examples to reduce brittleness.

4) Strategic direction (what to prioritize next cycle)
- Move from brittle rule lists to a hybrid: continuous scoring functions + targeted rule overrides for clear extreme regions.
- Add locality: bring KNN/prototype-based behavior for ambiguous/tie examples instead of always using the same global fallback.
- Expand and formalize interaction features (products, ratios, normalized ranks) and systematically evaluate which combinations boost multiclass discrimination.
- Replace many hard thresholds with soft thresholds (sigmoids/soft gating) so small changes in input produce gradual changes in predicted probabilities.
- Keep an ensemble mindset: combine a few complementary subsystems rather than one monolithic rule set.

Concrete creative strategies to explore next cycle

Strategy 1 — Multiclass continuous scoring with interaction features
- Create three or four continuous class scores (score1..score4) computed as linear combinations of base features and engineered interactions:
  - Base: A, B, C, D, E
  - Interactions: A*C, B*C, C*D, A*B, B*D
  - Ratios: C/(D+ε), B/(A+ε), E/(max(A,B,C,D)+ε)
  - Transforms: log1p of large-range features (log1p(C), log1p(C*D)), squared terms for high sensitivity (C^2 if helpful)
- Pass each raw score through a small monotonic squashing (e.g., logistic) to get pseudo-probabilities and choose the argmax.
- Tune coefficients via lightweight grid search on preserved/cross-cycle examples; use regularization (keep coefficients small) to limit overfitting.

Why: preserves interpretability but replaces brittle thresholds with soft weighted evidence; interactions capture the strong C*D signal more smoothly.

Strategy 2 — Local similarity (prototype/KNN) fallback for ambiguous/tie regions
- Standardize features (divide by 100 or z-score using running statistics).
- Compute weighted Euclidean distance to preserved training/cross-cycle prototypes; weights favor C and C*D and the feature identified most informative in previous cycles.
- If the top gap_ratio is small (e.g., gap_ratio ≤ 0.08) or global score is near decision boundary, defer to KNN vote (k=3 or weighted by inverse distance) to pick class.
- Optionally compute class prototypes (centroids) per class and use nearest centroid when memory size must be limited.

Why: local interpolation handles edge cases and near-ties better than a global rule list; it generalizes memorization.

Strategy 3 — Mixture-of-experts (specialized modules + gating)
- Build several small expert modules, each specialized with simple rules:
  - Expert C-power: focuses on C-heavy examples (C>threshold or C*D large) — outputs strong preference for class 1 or 2 depending on secondary signals.
  - Expert E-power: for extreme E-dominance → class 4 unless C*D overwhelms.
  - Expert high-D: focuses on D-driven class 3 patterns (D very high and A/B support).
  - Expert balanced/tie: uses soft scoring + KNN for ambiguous cases.
- Build a gating function that weights experts based on feature-region indicators (which feature is max, gap_ratio, whether C*D>some value).
- Final prediction is the argmax of aggregated expert scores (weighted sum).

Why: different regions have different discriminative cues. This lets each module be simple but accurate in its domain and reduces cross-signal conflict.

Strategy 4 — Rich feature transforms + smooth thresholds
- Systematically add:
  - Order statistics: rank position of each feature (1..5), top-2 mean, median of features.
  - Normalized features: A/max_val, A/sum, A/(sum-top1+ε).
  - Smooth thresholds: replace if X>=T then ... with sigmoids s(X;T,k) to weight rules rather than turn them on/off.
- Use these transformed features within the scoring model or rule gating so that borderline inputs transition smoothly between rule regimes.

Why: reduces brittleness at thresholds and encodes relative standing of features (better captures dominance).

Strategy 5 — Lightweight learning of rule coefficients and validation
- Keep the human-readable rule structure but turn some numeric thresholds/coefs into tunable parameters (weights for the linear score, multiplier for C*D cutoff, gap_ratio threshold).
- Use simple optimization (grid search or coordinate descent) on the preserved dataset to pick numeric values that maximize cross-cycle validation accuracy.
- Maintain a complexity/interpretability budget: prefer few tunable parameters to avoid overfitting.

Why: small, targeted parameter tuning often yields big gains while retaining rule interpretability.

Practical evaluation plan (how to test)
- For each new strategy, run a small ablation suite: (A) baseline rules, (B) new scoring with fixed params, (C) scoring with tuned params, (D) scoring + KNN fallback. Track accuracy and confusion patterns.
- Pay special attention to the tie/near-tie subset and mid-range examples; measure per-class precision/recall to see which strategies help specific classes.
- Keep a small rolling set of cross-cycle validation examples (increase memory of prototypes gradually) to avoid overfitting to the immediate training set.

Final recommendation (next cycle priority)
1. Implement Strategy 1 (continuous multiclass scoring with interactions) + Strategy 4 (smooth thresholds/transformations) to replace many brittle thresholds.
2. Add Strategy 2 (KNN/prototype fallback) specifically gated on the near-tie region (gap_ratio small).
3. If time permits, wrap the above as a mixture-of-experts (Strategy 3) to combine specialized modules for extremes and ambiguous regions.
4. Include Strategy 5 to tune a small number of numeric coefficients via grid search on preserved examples.

These steps should reduce brittleness, better capture multiplicative effects like C*D, and give robust handling of ambiguous mid-range cases while remaining interpretable and computationally cheap.
