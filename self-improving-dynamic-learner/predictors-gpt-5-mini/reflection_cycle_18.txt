================================================================================

Summary and context
- Cycle 18 reached a best accuracy of 58.66% (avg 54.01%, 10 iterations), and preserved 3 cross-cycle training examples. The best function blended a set of hard rules, a small weighted linear score, and several pairwise/cooperative tests (notably C*D), plus many threshold/tie-break heuristics. This gives a clear base to improve generalization and resolve ambiguity regions.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Pairwise product signals: C * D >= threshold was a robust indicator for class 1 in multiple cases — cooperative multiplicative interactions are informative when two features jointly amplify a signal.
- Mass / sum thresholds: total sum s, A+B, and counts of values >= 60 (high_count) reliably captured “mass” patterns that mapped to class 1.
- Dominance rules: single-variable dominance (E very large → class 4; C largest and large → class 2 or 1 depending on context; D very large + A/B support → class 3) were useful. Explicit dominance + gap tests help resolve many cases.
- Soft scoring + tie handling: the weighted linear score and gap_ratio-based “near-tie” logic produced reasonable fallback behavior for ambiguous inputs.
- Conditional conjunctions: rules combining inequalities (e.g., D high AND A+B high → class 3) captured interactions missed by pure marginal thresholds.

2) Failure analysis (what still causes errors)
- Near-tie / mid-range ambiguity: many inputs where multiple features are similar and moderate (no clear dominant, products below thresholds, sums borderline) remain misclassified. The current soft score is a blunt instrument here.
- Boundary sensitivity / hard thresholds: many rules rely on fixed cutoffs (e.g., C >= 78, D >= 75). Small perturbations around those cutoffs flip predictions and reduce robustness.
- Unseen combinations and rare patterns: the hard-coded training row lookups and very specific conjunctions overfit certain examples but fail to generalize for similar but not identical tuples.
- Nonlinear and rank-based relationships underexploited: there are likely useful signals in relative order/ranks and normalized ratios that are not fully used (only gap_ratio and some dominance checks).
- Interactions beyond C*D: A*D, B*C, or asymmetric interactions (feature divided by another) are not systematically explored.

3) Innovation opportunities (what to try next)
- Normalization and relative features: use ranks, normalized ratios (feature / sum, feature / max), and standardized scores to remove absolute scale sensitivity and make thresholds more stable.
- Expanded multiplicative and non-linear features: try pairwise products beyond C*D (A*D, B*C), squared terms, and log/exp transforms to capture diminishing or amplifying effects.
- Prototype/centroid distances per class: compute distance of input to representative centroids (means/medians) of each class over derived-feature space and choose the nearest class as a soft signal.
- Small learned calibrator: use a lightweight logistic or tree-based calibrator on derived features to find robust thresholds without overfitting to specific rows. This can be kept deterministic if necessary (simple decision tree with shallow depth and integer thresholds).
- Soft ensemble / voting: combine multiple weak heuristics (mass rule, dominance rule, product rule, centroid vote) and use weighted voting so no single brittle rule dominates.

4) Strategic direction (priorities for next cycle)
- Priority 1: Build a richer derived-feature set (normalized ratios, ranks, pairwise products, squared/log transforms) and evaluate their mutual information with classes. This will give robust features for rules.
- Priority 2: Replace many hard cutoffs with soft scoring and voting using the new features — move from brittle if-else to a small deterministic ensemble or shallow decision tree that can be tuned.
- Priority 3: Systematically handle near-tie cases via rank-gap measures, centroid proximity, and a tie-resolution subroutine that uses variance/std-dev and secondary features (e.g., if top2 close, break ties with product interactions).
- Priority 4: Reduce overfitting to exact rows by keeping training-row exceptions minimal and instead using prototypes or learned small-rule thresholds that generalize.

Creative planning — 4 concrete strategies to explore next cycle
1) Normalized-rank + centroid voting
- New operations: compute for each feature: normalized value (v / sum), rank (1..5), rank_gap (top1 - top2 normalized), and z-score-like standardized value (v - mean_of_vals)/std_of_vals.
- Logical structure: create class prototypes (centroids) in this derived-feature space using preserved examples and training summaries. Compute Euclidean or Manhattan distance from input to each class centroid and treat nearest-centroid as one vote.
- Handling challenging inputs: when rank_gap is small (near-tie), increase weight of centroid vote and decrease weight of single-variable dominance rules.
- Novel interactions: use centroid-space distances combined with product-rule votes (see strategy 2) to break ties. This is robust to global scale shifts.

2) Expanded multiplicative and nonlinear bank + weighted voting
- New operations: pairwise products (A*D, B*C, A*B), normalized products (A*D/(sum+1)), squared features (C^2), logs/log1p for large values, and ratio features (C/(D+1), A/(B+1)).
- Logical structure: create a bank of 6–8 heuristic tests (e.g., C*D > T1 → vote for class1; B*C/(sum) > T2 → vote for class2; A*D large + E small → class3; E/max > 0.5 → class4). Use a weighted sum of votes to choose a class.
- Handling challenging inputs: soft thresholds implemented as continuous votes (sigmoids or piecewise linear) rather than hard cutoffs to avoid boundary brittleness.
- Novel interactions: test asymmetric products (B*C more informative than C*B? use directional pairings) and product-to-sum ratios (A*D / (A+B+C)).

3) Hierarchical decision flow with learned micro-calibration
- New operations: build a shallow hierarchy: first branch by global category (mass vs. dominant vs. cooperative) using normalized sum, max_fraction (max_v / sum), and high_count. Then within each branch, apply specialized rules tuned for that regime.
- Logical structure: e.g., if max_fraction < 0.25 and high_count >= 3 → “mass” branch → class1; else if max_fraction > 0.45 → “dominant” branch → resolve between classes 2/3/4 by checking specific pairwise interactions and rank of the dominant feature; else → “cooperative” branch → use product-based tests and centroid proximity.
- Handling challenging inputs: by separating regimes you can apply different thresholds appropriate for each domain, reducing the global threshold brittleness.
- Novel interactions: allow micro-calibration in each leaf: a tiny deterministic table lookup or a one-dimensional threshold tuned on a small set of validation examples to refine decisions.

4) Tie-resolution subroutine + uncertainty-aware fallback
- New operations: compute tie metrics: normalized gap_ratio, entropy-like measure of normalized values (treat normalized values as distribution and compute Shannon entropy), and standard deviation.
- Logical structure: if tie_metric (low gap_ratio OR high entropy OR low std) indicates uncertainty, do the following ordered fallback:
  1) centroid nearest-class (from strategy 1)
  2) weighted-product vote (from strategy 2)
  3) small learned rule calibrated on ambiguous training examples (one or two features) — deterministic, interpretable
- Handling challenging inputs: avoids arbitrary fallback to a single fallback class (currently default 3). Instead chooses by ensemble and uses an “I’m uncertain” path that prioritizes similarity to known ambiguous cases.
- Novel interactions: use entropy * max_fraction to modulate confidence; low entropy + high max_fraction → dominance rules, else ensemble.

Implementation and evaluation plan (practical)
- Phase A (derive features): implement and evaluate a feature bank (normalized ratios, ranks, products, logs, squared) and compute per-feature class separation metrics to prioritize which features to use in heuristics.
- Phase B (rule prototypes): construct the heuristic banks and centroid prototypes from preserved training and cross-cycle examples. Test each strategy in isolation for accuracy and for types of errors (confusion matrix).
- Phase C (ensemble + tie routine): combine best heuristics as weighted votes with the hierarchy and tie-resolution subroutine. Tune a small number of integer weights/thresholds by grid search on preserved examples and local validation.
- Phase D (robustness checks): stress-test around thresholds (± small perturbations) to ensure decisions are stable. Reduce number of exact row exceptions and replace with prototypes where possible.

Final note
Focus next cycle on richer derived features + structured decision flow (hierarchical + ensemble) and resolving near-tie regions with centroid/prototype reasoning. That combination should reduce brittle cutoffs, improve generalization beyond hard-coded rows, and raise overall accuracy while keeping the model interpretable and deterministic.
