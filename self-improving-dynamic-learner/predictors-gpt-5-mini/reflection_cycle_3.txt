STRATEGIC REFLECTION — CYCLE 3

High-level takeaways
- The most reliable signals so far were dominance and contrast (the single largest variable and its gap to the runner-up), large additive sums (A+B or total s), and multiplicative interactions (notably C*D). These gave clear separations for many rows.
- Hard cases remain where multiple moderate signals conflict (e.g., A and B both mid-high with C medium), or where class boundaries are defined by subtle combinations or small-value exceptions. Memorization of training rows boosted in-sample accuracy but exposes generalization limits.
- Preserving cross-cycle examples (3) helped retain rare rules; we should continue explicit memory for low-frequency patterns while seeking compact generalizations.

1) Patterns Observed
- Max-dominance + gap: If one variable is clearly the max and far ahead of the next, its identity strongly predicts class (especially E for class 4; A or large sums for class 1).
- Pairwise/product interactions: C*D high reliably mapped to a particular class (class 1). Products capture joint strength that sums miss.
- A+B and s thresholds: Large A+B or total sum indicates class 1 in many cases; conversely very small E or tiny C often biases toward class 3 or 4.
- Tiered fallbacks/weighted score: A simple weighted linear score provided a decent fallback for ambiguous inputs.

2) Failure Analysis (what still breaks)
- Overlapping/ambiguous regions: Inputs where several features are moderately high lead to conflicting heuristics (e.g., B suggests class 2, A+B suggests class 1).
- Boundary sensitivity: Cases near thresholds flip classes on small noise; deterministic hard thresholds cause brittle decisions.
- Rare structural rules: Patterns that depend on parity, remainders, or more complex transforms (ratios, normalized ranks) are still missed.
- Overfitting via memorization: Exact training row lookup helps in-sample accuracy but is fragile for unseen but similar combinations.

3) Innovation Opportunities (haven’t fully explored)
- Normalized/relative features: ratios (A/B, A/(sum+1)), ranks (which variable is 1st/2nd), and relative gaps scaled by the max could capture contrast robustly.
- Polynomial and interaction terms beyond simple products: squares, cross-terms, and normalized products (A*B/(C+1)) can reveal non-linear class boundaries.
- Soft/ensemble decision-making: Multiple weak heuristics voting with confidence scores (rather than single-rule priority) to handle conflicts.
- Local models / clustering: Partition feature space into regions (by clustering or simple binning) and learn different rules per region—reduces contradictions from global heuristics.
- Modular / parity checks and small-value exceptions: Use modulo tests or bitwise features to capture discrete patterns that thresholds miss.

4) Strategic Direction (priorities for next cycle)
- Priority 1: Build normalized dominance and ratio features (rank, gap/max, A/sum) and use them to form soft dominance rules with margins (hysteresis).
- Priority 2: Expand multiplicative/polynomial interactions (pairwise products, squares, normalized products) focusing on C and D interactions plus A*B terms.
- Priority 3: Implement an ensemble/cascade of specialized heuristics that emit confidence scores; combine by weighted voting with tie-break rules.
- Priority 4: Explore local rules via simple clustering or rule sets per partition to capture rare but coherent local structures.
- Priority 5 (exploratory): Test parity/modular features and small-value exception handlers to catch discrete-pattern classes.

CREATIVE PLANNING — 4 SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO TRY NEXT CYCLE

Strategy A — Normalized dominance + soft thresholds
- New operations: Compute ranks (position of each variable within sorted list), normalized gap = (max - second_max)/max, and normalized contributions A_norm = A / (s+1), etc.
- Logic: Replace hard “if max==X and gap>=T” with soft-confidence: e.g., confidence_X = w_rank*rank_score + w_gap*(gap_norm) + w_norm*A_norm. If confidence_X > 0.6 → choose class mapped to X. Use hysteresis margins (e.g., need 0.15 margin to prefer X over Y) to avoid flip-flopping near boundaries.
- Handling tricky inputs: If confidences tie, fall back to ensemble scoring (see Strategy C). This reduces brittle threshold errors and smooths boundaries.
- Novel interaction: Combine normalized dominance with normalized C contribution to block cases where a dominant E but low C should map to class 4.

Strategy B — Expanded polynomial/interactions focused on C & D, and A*B
- New operations: Pairwise products (A*B, A*C, B*C, C*D, D*E), normalized products (A*B/(s+1)), squares and squared differences (A^2, (A-B)^2), and ratios like C/(D+1).
- Logic: Create rules such as: if C*D/(s+1) > threshold → class 1; if (A*B) is large but C is low → class 1 else if B*C large and A relatively small → class 2. Use threshold bands rather than single cutoffs.
- Handling tricky inputs: For borderline product values use local gradient test: check direction of small perturbation (if increasing C would flip product, then lower confidence).
- Novel interaction: Use normalized cross-terms like (C*D - A*B) to detect which pair dominates and direct class accordingly.

Strategy C — Ensemble of heuristics with confidence-weighted voting
- New operations: Each heuristic outputs [class, confidence]. Heuristics include: dominance rule (Strategy A), product rule (Strategy B), sum/AB rule, small-E exception rule, and memorized exact matches.
- Logic: Compute weighted votes sum_conf[class] = Σ confidence_i * weight_i. Final class = argmax sum_conf. If margin between top two < delta, trigger tie-break using local clustering or fallback weighted score.
- Handling tricky inputs: Conflicting weak signals are naturally smoothed; explicit fallback for ambiguous cases reduces misclassification on boundary inputs.
- Novel interaction: Dynamically adjust heuristic weights using cross-cycle preserved examples (increase weight for heuristics that correctly classify preserved examples).

Strategy D — Partitioned/local rule learning (lightweight clustering)
- New operations: Partition by coarse bins or small K-means on normalized features (e.g., bin by dominant variable and normalized sum). For each bin learn a small prioritized rule set or local linear weighted score.
- Logic: If input falls in cluster #k, apply cluster-specific thresholds and interaction rules rather than global ones. For very small clusters (rare patterns) preserve exact examples as memory.
- Handling tricky inputs: Local rules reduce contradictory global signals because the decision surface is simpler inside each region.
- Novel interaction: Combine with ensemble: cluster membership can reweight heuristic confidences (heuristics more trusted in particular clusters).

(Optionally) Strategy E — Discrete/parity and small-value exception handlers (exploration)
- New operations: Modular checks (sum % 2 or % 3), check for low-value patterns (any variable <= t), or large remainder patterns (A mod B).
- Logic: Gate a few specialized exceptions: e.g., if E <= 10 and (sum % 3 == 0) then class 3; if small C and small D but A>>B then class 1. These are exploratory and applied after ensemble ties fail.
- Handling tricky inputs: Captures rare discrete rules overlooked by continuous heuristics.
- Novel interaction: Combine modular tests with cluster-based memory so discrete checks are only triggered in clusters where they occurred previously.

Implementation notes and metrics to track next cycle
- Track per-heuristic precision/recall on preserved examples to reweight heuristics across cycles.
- Use small margin/hysteresis parameters to reduce sensitivity — tune via limited search (grid on a few thresholds).
- Keep memorization for very rare exact rows but minimize it by preferring compact generalized rules where possible.
- Limit complexity per iteration: test one or two strategies at a time, measure improvement on held-out unseen examples and on preserved cross-cycle examples.

Prioritized plan of action (next cycle)
1. Implement Strategy A (normalized dominance + soft thresholds) and Strategy C (ensemble) together — these should give immediate robustness and reduce threshold brittleness.
2. Add Strategy B (polynomial interactions) to capture known C*D signal and A*B effects; integrate into ensemble.
3. If accuracy plateaus, run Strategy D (lightweight clustering) to capture local idiosyncrasies and reduce conflicts.
4. Reserve Strategy E for exploratory sweeps if residual errors show discrete/periodic patterns.

Goal: improve overall accuracy by resolving ambiguous regions (via ensemble + soft thresholds) and capturing non-linear joint effects (via polynomial interactions and local rules), while continuing to preserve a few representative examples across cycles to anchor rare rules.
