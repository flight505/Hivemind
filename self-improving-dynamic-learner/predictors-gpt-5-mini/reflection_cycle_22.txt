Strategic reflection — what I learned from Cycle 22 and how to move forward

High-level summary
- The best function combined simple memorization for exact samples with a set of human-crafted, interpretable heuristics (sums, A+B, C*D product, max/second-max gap, a lightweight weighted score). That gave a modest win (60.66%) by capturing several dominant, easily separable regimes while still falling back to heuristics for ambiguous inputs.
- The preserved cross-cycle examples (3) helped anchor a few corner cases but also reveal a continuing reliance on memorization rather than broadly generalizable decision boundaries.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Bulk mass rules: total sum and A+B were strong first-order predictors for class 1 (high overall mass -> class 1).
- Pairwise cooperation: the product C*D and threshold rules on both C and D identified a subset of class 1 or class 3 patterns effectively (strong multiplicative interactions).
- Dominance signals: absolute dominance of one feature (E >= high threshold) was reliably predictive for class 4; similarly, C dominance often pointed to class 2.
- Relative-gap cues: gap between top and second value (and its normalized ratio) helped separate “dominant single feature” cases from “close competition” cases and justified different scoring thresholds.
- Soft linear score: a weighted linear score over features provided a compact fallback that worked acceptably in near-tie regions.
- Conditional overrides: hierarchical conditionals (big rules first, then finer rules) allowed straightforward exception handling and boosted accuracy for many structured regimes.

2) Failure analysis (what’s still hard)
- Near ties and multi-modal close values: many misclassifications occur when two or three features are close; current gap heuristics are crude and mis-handle borderline competitions.
- Context-sensitive exceptions: thresholds that worked in one subregion break in another (e.g., C large + small E sometimes is 4 not 2), pointing to complex context interactions not captured by isolated thresholds.
- Sparse/isolated dominance with low support: single-feature peaks (like isolated C with low others) sometimes map to different classes depending on subtle supporting cues (D or E), which we don’t consistently capture.
- Small-value edge cases: small absolute values combined with certain ratios can flip class but are not well represented by absolute-threshold heuristics.
- Overfitting / memorization dependency: memorized samples help sample fit but reduce generalization and hide where rules fail.

3) Innovation opportunities (ideas not fully explored)
- Nonlinear transforms and ratios: log, square, reciprocal, and exponent transforms plus pairwise ratios (A/B, C/(A+B), etc.) to capture relative importance rather than absolute thresholds.
- Feature ranking and ordinal features: using ranks of values (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and positions (which variable is max/second-max) as discrete features can simplify handling of tie/near-tie cases.
- Prototype / distance-based classification: learn representative prototypes per class and assign by distance (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, or rank-based distance) to capture multidimensional boundaries.
- Mixture / ensemble of simple experts: specialized small rules/expert models for different regions (e.g., “high-sum expert”, “C-dominant expert”, “E-dominant expert”) combined via gating function.
- Soft scoring with calibrated thresholds: replace brittle if-then thresholds with a scoring function and class-specific calibrated cutoffs (or probabilistic softmax) to reduce sharp errors at boundaries.
- Higher-order interaction terms: include C*D, A*D, A*C, pairwise sums, and squared terms to capture synergy or diminishing returns.

4) Strategic direction — priorities for next cycle
(1) Improve tie/near-tie handling by switching from raw thresholds to rank-based features and normalized gap measures, combined with soft scoring.
(2) Introduce prototype-distance rules and a small k-NN style memory of representative vectors per class to replace pure memorization with generalizable neighborhood reasoning.
(3) Build an ensemble of specialized experts (3–4) with a simple gating function — this allows simpler rules per region and reduces cross-region threshold conflicts.
(4) Add nonlinear feature transformations and systematic interaction terms; evaluate which transforms consistently improve validation accuracy.
(5) Instrument targeted diagnostics and small synthetic perturbations to expose brittle regions and test robustness.

Creative planning — 3–5 concrete strategies to try next cycle

Strategy A — Rank + Normalized-Gap + Soft Score (priority: high)
- Operations to try:
  - Feature ranks: convert raw values into rank positions (rank 1..5 for each sample) and use which variable holds rank 1 and rank 2 as categorical cues.
  - Normalized gap: compute (max - second_max) / (sum or max), and also (max - mean_of_others)/max to better capture isolation.
  - Soft weighted score: retain weighted linear score but map it through a logistic-like mapping and use class-specific thresholds rather than hard cutpoints.
- Logical structure:
  - First decide by rank patterns (e.g., if rank1 is E and gap_norm >= .25 => class 4).
  - Else use logistic-scored probability with cutoffs that vary by which variable is top-ranked.
- Handling challenging patterns:
  - Near ties: if gap_norm small, use rank2 and local score differences instead of absolute thresholds.
- Novel interactions:
  - Interaction of rank and score (e.g., when C is top-ranked, reduce required score threshold to be class 1).

Strategy B — Prototypes and Distance-based Assignment (priority: high)
- Operations to try:
  - Maintain 3–5 prototype vectors per class (centroids) built from correctly classified training examples or cluster centers.
  - Compute distances: Euclidean and rank-space distance (e.g., comparing rank vectors), possibly Mahalanobis if covariance estimated.
  - Soft nearest-prototype decision: assign to nearest prototype with distance-conditioned confidence; if distances ambiguous, defer to fallback rule.
- Logical structure:
  - Gating: if distance ratio (closest/second) < threshold, take prototype class; else apply rule-based expert ensemble.
- Handling challenging patterns:
  - This captures nuanced multivariate relationships and handles cases where absolute thresholds fail.
- Novel interactions:
  - Combine distance in raw-value space with rank-space distance to be robust to scale differences.

Strategy C — Expert Ensemble with Gating (priority: medium)
- Operations to try:
  - Define small experts: (1) High-sum expert (sum, A+B), (2) Pairwise-coop expert (C*D and pairwise products), (3) E-dominance expert (E gap), (4) Low-mass/isolated expert (low sum but high C).
  - Build a light gating function: rule-based or scoring-based that chooses the dominant expert per sample.
- Logical structure:
  - Gating returns the active expert; experts are much simpler and tuned to their niche to avoid contradictory thresholds.
- Handling challenging patterns:
  - Reduces interference where a threshold that’s valid in one region breaks another; each expert only tuned for its region.
- Novel interactions:
  - Experts can output soft scores; ensemble can average with prototype confidence.

Strategy D — Nonlinear and Interaction Feature Expansion + Simple Learner (priority: medium)
- Operations to try:
  - Add features: pairwise ratios (A/B, B/A, C/(A+B), C/(max+1)), products (A*D, B*C), squares and logs (log(x+1), sqrt), and normalized features (x/sum).
  - Feed into a simple linear classifier with L1 regularization (or a tiny decision stump ensemble) to identify robust combination weights.
- Logical structure:
  - Use learned weights as interpretable scoring function, then convert to thresholded decisions with per-class offsets.
- Handling challenging patterns:
  - Ratios capture relative dominance; transforms reduce sensitivity to large absolute values.
- Novel interactions:
  - Look specifically for combination terms of form C/(A+B) * D or E/(max+1) as potential strong predictors.

Strategy E — Targeted Robustness testing and synthetic augmentation (priority: supporting)
- Operations to try:
  - Generate small perturbations around ambiguous samples (vary values by ±5–15%) to check decision stability.
  - Create synthetic extreme patterns (e.g., isolate one high variable with others near zero; two equal highs; monotonic gradients) to reveal brittle boundaries.
- Logical structure:
  - For any rule candidate, compute local decision stability (percent of perturbed samples with same class); prefer rules with high stability.
- Handling challenging patterns:
  - Exposes and helps tune fragile thresholds; allows intentional smoothing (e.g., broaden thresholds or use soft scores) where needed.
- Novel interactions:
  - Use perturbation feedback to tune gating parameters and prototype radii.

Evaluation & experiment plan for next cycle
- Track per-class precision/recall and confusion matrix changes, not just overall accuracy — prioritize balancing classes with systematic underperformance.
- Ablation tests: measure the contribution of each new feature (ranks, ratio, products, prototypes) by incremental addition and cross-validation.
- Stability metric: measure classification stability under small perturbations; prefer rules/models that trade a little absolute accuracy for much higher stability.
- Limit memorization: allow a small number of prototypes for nearest-neighbor logic but avoid storing many exact training rows; favor generalizable prototypes learned from clusters.

Final recommended roadmap (concrete next steps)
1. Implement Strategy A + E first (rank + gap + soft scoring + perturbation testing) to reduce tie errors — highest expected payoff.
2. In parallel, build prototype centroids per class and test distance-based assignments (Strategy B) with a gating fallback — replace memorization with prototype reasoning.
3. If time remains, add the expert ensemble (Strategy C) and nonlinear feature expansion (Strategy D), run ablation and stability analysis, and choose the smallest combination that yields robust improvements.

This roadmap preserves interpretability while moving from brittle thresholds and memorization toward smoother, multivariate decision boundaries and robust handling of near-tie and edge cases.
