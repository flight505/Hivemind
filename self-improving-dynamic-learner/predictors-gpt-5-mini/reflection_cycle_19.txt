Cycle Performance: Best 57.24%, Average 50.81%
Total Iterations: 10

================================================================================

Cycle 19 summary is useful context: best function reached 57.24% accuracy with a fairly complex, hand-crafted rule set that relied heavily on sums, products (notably C*D), max/second-max gap measures, and a weighted “score” for fallback rules. Average accuracy ~50.8% across 10 iterations suggests some useful structure was found but substantial ambiguity remains.

Below is a focused strategic reflection followed by a concrete, prioritized plan of creative strategies to try next cycle.

1) Patterns observed
- Strong cooperative interactions (C*D, product terms) are very predictive in many cases. High CD often maps to class 1 or 3 depending on other mass.
- Large total mass (sum of A..E) or large AB/ABC sums reliably indicate class 1 in many examples.
- Dominance patterns (one variable much larger than the rest) are informative: if E dominates strongly → class 4; if C or B dominate under certain supports → class 2.
- Gap-based tie-breaking (max vs second_max) helps disambiguate near-equal peaks.
- A single linear weighted score (A*0.44 + B*0.30 + ...) as a fallback captured some general monotonic tendencies.

2) Failure analysis (what still trips us up)
- Near-tie regions and borderline thresholds: hard thresholds cause brittle misclassification around small changes (sensitivity to +-1).
- Complex, non-linear interactions: some class boundaries appear to depend on multi-way interactions or ratios (e.g., C relative to D or E) that are not captured by simple thresholds.
- Rare/exact exceptions: function memorizes some training rows; unseen similar exceptions are mishandled.
- Conflicting signals: cases where sum, product, and dominance suggest different classes (no single rule resolves reliably).
- Overfitting to hand-chosen coefficients and thresholds — good on training-like patterns, weaker on varied inputs.

3) Innovation opportunities (creative mathematical approaches not fully explored)
- Smooth, differentiable scoring rather than hard thresholds: use sigmoids/margins so small changes don’t flip decisions.
- Learnable linear/logistic models on an enriched feature set (pairwise products, ratios, ranks) rather than purely hand thresholds.
- Local exemplar-based reasoning (distance to nearest training prototypes) to capture exceptions and rare conjunctions.
- Piecewise models: small “experts” for different regions (high-sum region, E-dominant region, near-tie region) each learned/tuned separately.
- Rank- and order-statistics features (argmax index, normalized gap, counts above percentiles) to capture relational structure between variables instead of absolute thresholds.
- Nonlinear transforms (log, sqrt, inverse) and normalized ratios (feature / sum) to stabilize scale effects.

4) Strategic direction (what to prioritize next)
- Prioritize hybrid approaches that combine learned, soft-scoring models on engineered features with small rule overrides for clear-cut regions. This balances generalization with leveraging strong domain signals (e.g., CD product).
- Build and validate a small feature-engineering pipeline (pairwise products, ratios, ranks, gap ratios, counts above thresholds) and fit a simple multinomial logistic or small tree on those features.
- Add an exemplar/KNN fallback for low-confidence predictions to capture exceptions.
- Replace brittle hard thresholds with smoothed scoring and margin-based tie-breaking.
- Systematically tune thresholds and feature weights with cross-validation and keep a small priority set of memorized exceptions (but constrain size).

CREATIVE PLANNING — 4 concrete strategies to try next cycle
(Each strategy lists new operations, logical/conditional structures, approaches to handle hard patterns, and novel interactions)

Strategy A — Soft-scored class-specific scoring functions (priority: high)
- New ops: for each class j define score_j = w0_j + Σ w_i_j * feat_i where feat_i include raw A..E, pairwise products (A*B, A*C, B*C, C*D, etc.), ratios (C/D, C/(D+1), A/sum), ranks (rank of each variable), normalized gap = (max - second)/sum, and counts_above_k (e.g., count >=50).
- Use sigmoid or softplus transforms on large products (e.g., sigmoid((C*D - t)/s)) to make contributions smooth.
- Predict class = argmax_j score_j. Also compute confidence margin = top - second. If margin < small threshold, route to fallback (see Strategy B).
- Handles near-ties by smooth scoring and a tunable margin instead of brittle thresholds.
- Train weights via simple optimization (grid search or logistic regression on existing dataset) rather than hand picking.

Strategy B — Hybrid rule + exemplar KNN fallback (priority: high)
- New ops: normalized Euclidean distance in feature space using standardized features and engineered interactions.
- Logical structure: fast rule layer for decisive signals (very large CD, sum>300, E>95, strong dominance rules) — keep these as high-confidence overrides. If none trigger, compute soft scores (Strategy A). If soft score margin < threshold, compute K nearest neighbors (K=3 or 5) in normalized engineered-feature space and use weighted vote.
- Alternative handling: if nearest neighbors include memorized exceptions, prefer exemplar output.
- Novel interactions: distance can be computed on both raw-feature space and rank-feature space; weight neighbors by similarity in rank-space for ordinal consistency.

Strategy C — Piecewise small-tree + local linear experts (priority: medium)
- New ops: partitioning features — dominant_index (which variable is argmax), sum_bin, gap_bin (small/medium/large), high_CD flag.
- Build a shallow decision tree (depth 3–4) using these partition features. At each leaf, fit a simple linear classifier/regressor (class-scores) tailored to the local regime (e.g., leaf for "E dominant" uses features A/E, B/E, etc.).
- Conditional approach: logic first to place input in a regime; then expert model produces soft scores. This captures different underlying rules in different data regions and mitigates global conflicts.
- Handles challenging inputs that require different reasoning depending on context (e.g., when D is large we use different feature weights than when C is large).

Strategy D — Novel transformations + prototype distances (priority: exploratory)
- New ops and transforms: take logs or sqrt of large numeric features (log(C*D+1)), angular similarity to class prototypes (cosine between input vector and stored prototype vectors per class), and percentile-normalized features (feature value mapped to global percentile).
- Build prototypes: compute centroid and median vectors for each class in engineered feature space. Score inputs by negative distance to each prototype and combine with soft scores from Strategy A.
- Conditional approach: if prototype distance strongly favors one class (distance ratio >> 1), use it; otherwise combine with learned scores.
- This helps detect class-like shapes (relative composition across variables) that aren’t just high absolute values.

Ancillary refinements to implement alongside these strategies
- Expand cross-cycle exemplar memory: keep a small prioritized set of exceptions (not raw memorization of many rows) — but store generalized signatures: (dominant_index, gap_bin, sum_bin, prototype features) to apply more general overrides.
- Systematic threshold search and calibration: tune margins, sigmoid slopes, and tie-break thresholds with cross-validation rather than hand setting.
- Feature selection/pruning: add many candidate features but prune those that do not improve validation performance to avoid overfitting.
- Confidence-aware prediction: when overall confidence is low, prefer KNN/exemplar decision or a “neutral” default more robust to mistakes.

Practical next steps to run in Cycle 20
1. Implement a small feature pipeline: raw, all pairwise products, C*D, ratios (C/D, A/sum), ranks, gap_ratio, counts_above thresholds, log/sqrt transforms.
2. Fit a multinomial logistic model (or softmax linear model) on these features and evaluate via held-out validation. Use L2 regularization.
3. Implement the hybrid rule layer: encode only the strongest, high-precision overrides (e.g., CD>3000 -> class1, E>95 -> class4) and let the learned model handle the rest.
4. Add KNN fallback for low-margin predictions and prototype distance scoring as ensemble members.
5. Run ablation tests to see which engineered features and which components (rules, learned model, KNN, prototypes) contribute most to improved accuracy; iterate accordingly.

Concise prioritized list to take into Cycle 20
- Priority 1: Build smooth class-specific scoring (Strategy A) using engineered features and learn weights. Replace many hard thresholds with soft contributions.
- Priority 2: Add exemplar/KNN fallback for ambiguous cases and implement small high-precision rule overrides (Strategy B).
- Priority 3: Implement piecewise tree + local linear experts for distinct regimes (Strategy C).
- Priority 4: Experiment with prototype/angular similarity and percentile-normalized transforms (Strategy D).
- Always: tune margins and confidence thresholds with validation, and maintain a small generalized exception memory rather than a large literal lookup.

If you want, I can draft the exact feature list, the loss/optimization approach (regularized logistic vs small NN), and a suggested ordering of implementation steps (what to code/test first, what metrics to collect). Which of these strategies do you want prioritized for Cycle 20?
