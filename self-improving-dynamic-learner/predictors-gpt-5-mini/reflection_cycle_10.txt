STRATEGIC REFLECTION — CYCLE 10

Summary context
- Best accuracy 58.39%, average 55.80% across 10 iterations. A small set (3) of cross-cycle examples preserved suggests some useful invariants were found, but overall generalization remains modest.
- The winning function is a mix of memorized training rows + many hand-tuned heuristics: multiplicative checks (C*D), extreme-value shortcuts (E >= thresholds), additive sums (A+B, A+B+C), soft weighted scoring, and tie-gap handling.

1) Patterns observed — what worked best
- Multiplicative interactions: C * D (and C>=70 & D>=50 style conditions) repeatedly map cleanly to class 1. Multiplicative (or high joint) features are strong signals.
- Extreme-value dominance: Very large single features (E >= 95, or E dominating the others) reliably map to class 4 in many examples. Large A or very large A+B often push to class 1.
- Sum/aggregate thresholds: Total sums (s, abc, ab) and simple thresholds separate broad regions (s >= 300 -> class 1).
- Near-tie logic: When the top two values are close (small gap_ratio), a weighted linear score helps decide classes. Soft scoring provides graceful decisions in ambiguous regions.
- Small-value heuristics: Low E with moderate A or D tends to map to class 3 — simple conditional fallbacks are useful.

2) Failure analysis — what remains challenging
- Boundary/tie cases: Inputs near thresholds or near-equal top features still cause frequent errors. The current gap_ratio/soft score is useful but brittle and hand-tuned.
- Complex interactions and exceptions: Some examples require combinations of features (e.g., moderate C with specific A/B patterns) that single thresholds miss.
- Overfits via memorization: The explicit training dictionary guarantees perfect fit to training rows but reduces generalization. Relying on a few exact rows can hide systematic errors.
- Nonlinear patterns not captured by simple arithmetic: e.g., multiplicative + ratio + parity or modular-like behavior, or conditional scaling based on which feature is max, are underexplored.
- Regions with mid-range values (no extreme dominance) are inconsistent and produce most misclassifications.

3) Innovation opportunities — underexplored mathematical approaches
- Ratios and normalized features: A/B, B/A, C/D, D/E, and normalization by the sum or max can reveal relative dominance better than absolute thresholds.
- Polynomial and interaction features beyond pairwise product: (A*C), (A^2), (sqrt(B)), log transforms to compress ranges.
- Piecewise models / gating: use different classifiers for different "regimes" (E-dominant, C*D-dominant, A+B-high, tie-region), with a learned gating rule.
- Prototype / nearest-neighbor logic: use a small set of prototypes learned from data instead of hard-coded memorization; distance metrics weighted by feature importance.
- Symbolic or genetic search for formulas: automated search for compact algebraic expressions or decision trees may discover non-intuitive rules (e.g., floor/ceil, modulo).
- Soft probabilistic scoring and abstention: produce a confidence and consider “top-2” or abstain to reduce high-cost misclassifications.

4) Strategic direction — priorities for next cycle
- Reduce memorization and increase systematic generalization: remove or minimize exact row lookups; favor learned thresholds/weights.
- Focus on ambiguous/tie regions: build specialized submodels or refine the gap_ratio/weighted scoring approach to handle near-equals robustly.
- Expand feature space with normalized and multiplicative features, plus ratios and log transforms — test which combinations improve separability.
- Adopt hybrid strategy: small set of highly interpretable rules for clear regimes (extreme E, huge C*D, very large sums) + a lightweight data-driven model (decision tree, logistic or k-NN) for the messy middle.
- Implement automated threshold tuning and small search/optimization loops (grid search, hill-climb, simulated annealing) to move away from brittle hand-chosen constants.

CREATIVE PLANNING — 4 specific strategies to try next cycle

Strategy A — Ratio-normalized interaction set (priority 1)
- New features to add: A/sum, B/sum, C/sum, D/sum, E/sum; A/max, B/max, etc.; pairwise ratios A/B, B/C, C/D, D/E; and log(1+feature) transforms to compress extremes.
- Use thresholds on ratios (e.g., B/A > 1.4 was promising) but tune them via automated search instead of fixed constants.
- Rationale: ratios better capture relative dominance and reduce sensitivity to absolute scale; combined with existing multiplicative features this will clarify competitive cases (ties or near-ties).
- Implementation notes: evaluate combinations via cross-validation, prioritize rules that apply to >5% of data (avoid one-off exceptions).

Strategy B — Regime-gated ensemble of small experts (priority 2)
- Partition input space into explicit regimes with simple gating rules (fast to compute): E-dominant (E >= k1 or E >= max*), C*D-dominant (CD >= k2), A+B-dominant (ab >= k3), tie-region (gap_ratio <= k4), and residual.
- For each regime, use a specialist: decision stump or tiny decision tree and a small linear model with learned weights. Let the gating rule be learned/tuned (small grid search) rather than hard-coded.
- Rationale: different regimes have different effective features (multiplicative for C*D, additive for A+B, ratios for tie region). Gating keeps models compact and interpretable.
- Evaluation: measure per-regime accuracy to identify where to invest further.

Strategy C — Prototype/weighted k-NN with learned feature weights (priority 3)
- Maintain a small set of prototypes per class (learnable or discovered by clustering). For a new input, compute a weighted distance (weights for A,B,C,D,E learned by optimizing accuracy).
- Use soft-voting among nearest prototypes; if nearest distances are very close, fall back to tie-region specialist.
- Rationale: captures local structure, reduces need for many hand-tuned rules, and is robust to non-linear patterns. Prototype approach can also subsume memorized rows but allow generalization.
- Implementation: learn feature weights by optimizing on validation set (simple hill-climb) and try k=1..5.

Strategy D — Symbolic search for compact formulas + threshold tuning (priority 4)
- Use a constrained symbolic regression / genetic programming search to look for compact algebraic expressions mapping to class scores. Allow arithmetic, min/max, floor, log, ratios and simple conditionals.
- Couple with automated threshold tuning for constants (e.g., CD >= T, ab >= T). Penalize overly-complex expressions to favor interpretable solutions.
- Rationale: will discover non-obvious but simple rules and conditional combinations that human trial-and-error may miss.
- Implementation: limit program depth to keep runtime manageable; run multiple seeds and maintain a Pareto front (accuracy vs complexity).

Optional Strategy E — Soft-confidence outputs and boundary augmentation
- Output an internal confidence score; when confidence is low for an input, apply fallback ensemble (e.g., majority of small models) or return top-2 predictions for downstream use.
- Augment training with synthetic neighbors around boundary cases (slight perturbations of ambiguous inputs) to force models to learn stable decision boundaries.
- Rationale: reduces brittle threshold behavior and improves robustness around ties.

Evaluation & process improvements
- Stop using exact memorized rows as a crutch; instead encode them as prototypes if necessary.
- Use a small validation set and per-regime metrics to guide priority. Track confusion matrices to see systematic misroutes (e.g., class 2 → 1 errors).
- Automate small hyperparameter searches (grid or random) for thresholds and weights; keep rules interpretable by preferring fewer parameters.
- Preserve cross-cycle learning examples (increase from 3 if they are truly invariant) but store as prototypes or seed rules, not hard-coded special cases.

A short roadmap for next cycle
1. Implement Strategy A (ratio-normalized features) and run controlled experiments to measure improvement in tie-region accuracy.
2. Build regime-gated ensemble (Strategy B) and compare per-regime performance. If prototypes are promising, add Strategy C.
3. Run symbolic search in parallel (Strategy D) to harvest candidate concise rules; integrate top discoveries into the ensemble and re-evaluate.
4. Use synthetic boundary augmentation and confidence-based fallbacks to stabilize performance at the edges.

Goal for Cycle 11
- Increase overall accuracy by 4–8 points by focusing on tie/ambiguous cases and reducing ad-hoc memorization, with measurable per-regime improvements and a move toward learned (rather than hand-chosen) thresholds.

If you want, for Cycle 11 I can:
- produce a prioritized implementation plan with specific thresholds/feature lists to test,
- or draft the exact set of new features and a small grid-search plan for the gating thresholds to try first. Which would you prefer?
