Strategic reflection on Cycle 9 and plan for Cycle 10

Summary takeaway
- The current best function shows that simple additive thresholds (A+B, A+B+C), a strong multiplicative CD signal, E-based thresholds, argmax logic, and a compact weighted scoring fallback are the most effective building blocks so far. Memorizing training rows remains necessary for sample-perfect behavior but is not sufficient for generalization.
- The model wins when there are strong, unambiguous signals (very large CD, very large AB, very small or very large E, or a very large A). It struggles most on mid-range and conflicting inputs where multiple moderate signals compete.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Multiplicative interactions: C*D (or other cross-products) is a strong discriminative feature; large CD reliably indicates a particular class in many examples.
- Sum thresholds: AB and ABC thresholds (e.g., ab >= 100/140, abc >= 120) effectively capture concentrated mass across variables.
- Extreme E behavior: Very small E and very large E act like global overrides and are productive as early-cascade rules.
- Argmax and gap-based rules: Identifying the largest element and the gap to the second largest helps disambiguate “dominant variable” cases and near-tie fallbacks.
- Weighted linear scoring as a final fallback is useful to aggregate weak signals into a decision.

2) Failure analysis (what’s still challenging)
- Mid-range conflicts: Inputs where multiple features are moderately high but none dominates (no huge CD, AB moderate, E medium) often produce incorrect class assignment.
- Near-ties and subtle rank patterns: Cases where relative ordering (e.g., second > first by a little) or subtle rank-based interactions determine class are not fully captured.
- Digit/structural patterns: If labels depend on modular/digit properties (units digit, parity, multiples), current continuous thresholds miss them.
- Boundary sensitivity: Hard thresholds produce brittle behavior near cutoffs; small measurement noise flips classes.
- Rare or mixed-signal clusters: Regions of input space with few training examples are handled poorly; single global fallback scores can be misleading there.

3) Innovation opportunities (not yet fully explored)
- Ratio/normalization features: Relative size (A/max, A/B, A/(B+C), etc.) can capture dominance better than absolute thresholds.
- Rank-encoded features and top-k identity flags: Encoding whether C is in top-2, or which variables occupy top slots.
- Polynomial and interaction terms beyond CD: pairwise products (A*C, B*D), squared terms, and cross-differences (A-B)*(C-D).
- Modular and digit features: units digit, parity, modulo patterns (mod 3, mod 5) to catch structural rules.
- Gated ensemble / specialist models: Use a light gating layer to route inputs to specialized rule-sets for E-high, AB-high, CD-high, near-tie, etc.
- Lightweight learned parameters: Fit simple logistic regressions or perceptrons per specialist to tune thresholds and weights rather than using only hand-crafted constants.

4) Strategic direction (what to prioritize next)
- Prioritize building a small ensemble of specialist predictors with an explicit gating mechanism (hand rules + learned gating). This keeps interpretability while allowing finer-grained handling of different input regimes.
- Expand the feature set to include normalized ratios and rank indicators; these features are low-cost and often high-value for disambiguating “who dominates.”
- Add modular/digit features and parity tests as inexpensive extras—these can unlock simple rules that otherwise look noisy.
- Replace some hard thresholds with soft scores (sigmoid-like or linear scoring with learned thresholds) so decisions are less brittle near boundaries.
- Implement a nearest-neighbor / prototype recall step using preserved cross-cycle examples to handle rare clusters by similarity rather than global heuristics.

Creative planning — 5 specific strategies to explore in Cycle 10

1) Ratio + normalized dominance features
- New features: Ai_norm = A / max(A,B,C,D,E); pairwise ratios A/B, B/A, C/D, A/(B+C), C/(A+B), etc.
- Use these to detect true dominance even when absolute values are moderate (e.g., A is 40 but all others are 25 -> A_norm high).
- Conditional rule example: if A_norm >= 0.40 and A >= 30 then class = 1 (or route to A-specialist). Use soft thresholds by mapping ratio into a score instead of strict cutoff.

2) Rank-encoded rules and top-k identity gates
- Compute indices of top1, top2, top3 and their gaps. Create flags like top1==C, top2==B, gap < X.
- Specialist routing: If top1 in {A,B} and gap > threshold -> route to AB-specialist which applies AB/ABC thresholds; if top1==C and top2 > 0.6*top1 -> route to C-pair specialist.
- This captures ordering-dependent patterns (which variable’s position matters more than absolute value).

3) Expanded interaction set: polynomial & cross-term bank
- Add a curated set of interactions: A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, (A-B)^2, (C-D)^2, (A-B)*(C-E), harmonic mean of top2, geometric mean of (A,B).
- Use simple linear classifiers per class that take these interaction features; or build small scoring rules that check combinations (e.g., if A*C >= T and B <= S then class 1).
- This uncovers multiplicative synergies beyond just CD.

4) Modular/digit and parity detectors
- Extract units digit (x % 10), tens digit ((x//10)%10), parity (x % 2), and small moduli (mod 3, mod 5).
- Create conditional rules: if certain columns share same units digit or certain parity patterns hold, assign or prefer a class—useful if there are hidden digit-based patterns.
- Include combined tests like “if units_digit(A) == units_digit(B) and A+B > threshold then class X.”

5) Gated ensemble with soft scoring + memory recall
- Implement a fast gating stage: simple linear rule or decision tree of a few rules that maps input into one of several regimes (E-high, CD-high, AB-high, near-tie, low-sum).
- For each regime, maintain a small specialized rule-set: a tuned threshold set, a small logistic classifier (learned weights from retained examples), and a nearest-neighbor lookup among preserved examples (k=3) using L1 or weighted distance on normalized features.
- Combine outputs via confidence: if specialist confidence > θ then use its prediction; else fallback to weighted ensemble vote or a calibrated softmax of specialist scores.
- This addresses brittle boundaries by letting specialists focus on homogeneous subspaces and by allowing memory-based overrides.

Additional operational details / evaluation ideas
- Keep memorization of training rows but reduce reliance by growing cross-cycle preserved prototypes (cluster centers) for each class.
- Track per-class precision, recall, and confusion patterns to identify which specialist is misfiring.
- Use small ablation tests: temporarily disable CD rule, then disable AB rule, etc., to quantify contribution of each rule.
- Prefer soft thresholds (score contributions) over single hard cutoffs where possible; tune weights on preserved examples via grid search or small logistic fits.

Concrete next-cycle implementation order (practical)
1. Add normalized ratios and rank flags; re-evaluate immediate gain.
2. Implement gated routing (E-high, CD-high, AB-high, near-tie) with simple specialist rules for each gate.
3. Add polynomial/cross terms into specialist scoring, and replace some hard thresholds with learned linear weights (fit on preserved examples).
4. Add modular/digit features and test a small set of parity/modulo rules on misclassified cases.
5. Add NN prototype lookup as last-resort override for low-confidence cases.

Closing
Cycle 9 confirmed the value of multiplicative signals, sums, and argmax logic but also revealed brittle boundary sensitivity and mid-range confusion. The next cycle should combine more expressive features (ratios, ranks, polynomial interactions, modulars) with a gated ensemble of specialists and soft scoring. Prioritize the gating + specialist architecture and normalized features first — they are low-cost changes likely to yield robust gains.
