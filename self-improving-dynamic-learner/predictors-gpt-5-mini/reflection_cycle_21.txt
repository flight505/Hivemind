Strategic Reflection — Cycle 21

High-level takeaway
- The model improved by combining simple global summaries (sums, weighted score) with a few strong interaction tests (C*D, A+B+C mass, E dominance). Those heuristics produced the bulk of correct classifications and are likely capturing core generative signals in the data.
- Memorization of exact training rows and a few hard exceptions gives a small but reliable accuracy boost; however, it also hides generalization gaps. We should keep limited memorization for rare exact matches but focus on generalized rules that explain the majority of non-exact cases.

1) Patterns observed (what worked)
- Aggregate magnitude rules: total sum and A+B+C mass are strong predictors for class 1 in many cases. Large combined mass reliably maps to the same class in many examples.
- Strong multiplicative interaction C*D identifies a clear regime (class 1) when both are large — multiplicative features (not just additive) capture cooperative effects.
- Dominance / gap-based rules: a large clear winner (E or A/B/C/D) relative to the second-largest value often predicts specific classes (E-dominant => class 4, A/B mass => class 1).
- Weighted linear score: a simple weighted sum with tuned coefficients gives useful fallbacks in ambiguous regions—acts as a soft ranking when discrete thresholds fail.
- Conditional conjunctions: rules that combine thresholds on two features (e.g., D high AND A or B high => class 3) reduce false positives vs single-feature thresholds.

2) Failure analysis (what still trips us)
- Near-ties and soft margins: cases where multiple features are close in magnitude remain ambiguous — current gap_ratio/score thresholds help but are brittle.
- Mid-range noisy combinations: values that are neither extreme nor small (30–70) are often misclassified because the model relies on extremes.
- Rare cross-feature patterns and boundary cases (e.g., high C but mid D and large E) that contradict single-rule heuristics cause errors.
- Overfitting to memorized instances: exact-match lookups mask design flaws and don’t generalize to unseen nearby points.
- Nonlinear or periodic signals (if present) are not captured by linear weights, simple products, or thresholds.

3) Innovation opportunities (unexplored or under-explored)
- Relative / normalized features: ratios, proportions, and normalized ranks (e.g., A/sum, A/max, pairwise ratios) to capture relative dominance rather than absolute thresholds.
- Higher-order interactions (polynomials) and cross-terms beyond single product C*D — e.g., A*B, (C^2)*D, interaction of rank and magnitude.
- Rank-based conditional logic: use the ordering of features (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and gaps rather than raw values for tie-breaking.
- Modular and bitwise diagnostics: check modular residues or bit-pattern features to detect hidden periodic or categorical signals.
- Small ensembles / gating: combine specialized rule sub-models (e.g., an “extreme” model for high sums, a “ratio” model for near-ties, a “C*D” model) with a gating mechanism to pick the most confident specialist.

4) Strategic direction (priorities for the next cycle)
Prioritize:
1. Relative/ratio and rank-based features to better handle near-ties and mid-range noise.
2. Expand multiplicative and polynomial interactions (systematically explore pairwise and triple interactions).
3. Build a hierarchical gating ensemble of specialized rule blocks to reduce brittle monolithic thresholds.
4. Introduce small modular/bitwise features to detect any discrete or periodic signal.
5. Use synthetic boundary examples (data augmentation) around current decision boundaries to tune thresholds robustly rather than memorizing exceptions.

Creative Planning — Specific strategies to try next cycle

Strategy A — Normalize and rank-based decision layer
- New operations: compute normalized features A_norm = A / (sum+eps), A_maxrel = A / (max+eps), and pairwise ratios A/B, B/C, C/D, etc. Also compute ordinal rank positions (rank 1..5), top-2 gap, top-3 average.
- Logical structure: first route inputs through a rank/ratio gate:
  - If top1_norm > 0.45 and top1_gap > 0.20 => assign class consistent with which feature is top (e.g., top E => class 4).
  - If top2_norm close (within 10%) to top1_norm => go to tie-resolution submodule (see B).
- Alternative handling: this reduces reliance on absolute thresholds and handles scale shifts; importantly, it addresses near-ties by treating relative dominance as primary.
- Novel interaction: combine normalized rank with a small learned linear classifier (or a few tuned thresholds) rather than hard-coded absolute values.

Strategy B — Polynomial/interactions + learned thresholds
- New operations: systematically add pairwise and triple interactions: A*B, A*C, B*C, C*D, A*B*C, C^2, D^2, and feature squares/cubic where helpful.
- Logical structure: treat strong multiplicative interactions as ORed specialists:
  - If any interaction term exceeds a learned threshold (e.g., C*D > T1 or A*B > T2), trigger corresponding class suggestion and compute confidence (magnitude normalized).
  - Use a small scoring aggregator (weighted votes by normalized magnitude/confidence).
- Alternative handling: for ambiguous outputs, use the highest-confidence specialist. This converts brittle thresholding into soft competition among interaction specialists.
- Novel interaction: explore cross-power terms like (C^2)*D or A*(B+C) to capture asymmetric cooperation.

Strategy C — Hierarchical ensemble with gating + memorization guardrails
- New operations: build small specialized rule modules: “Sum/BigMass” module, “C*D/Multiplicative” module, “E-dominance” module, “Ratio/Tie” module, and a fallback weighted-score module.
- Logical structure: gating based on quick cheap checks (sum threshold, max_norm threshold, gap threshold) to decide which specialist(s) to consult; combine outputs by confidence-weighted voting.
- Alternative handling: keep exact-match memorization but only as a last resort when input exactly matches a preserved training example; avoid using memorization to mask rule weaknesses.
- Novel interaction: allow a specialist to abstain if its confidence is low; use abstention to force fallback to other modules.

Strategy D — Modular/bitwise and modular-arithmetic probes
- New operations: compute feature modulo small primes (value % 2, %3, %5, %7) and bitwise features (low-order bits, parity) as binary indicators; also compute floor divisions (A//k) to detect coarse buckets.
- Logical structure: add compact conditional checks for unusual periodic patterns (e.g., if most features share parity or same residue mod k).
- Alternative handling: this can detect hidden categorical or generated patterns that are invisible to purely arithmetic thresholds.
- Novel interaction: combine residues with rank info (e.g., top feature also has parity 1) as a signature for special classes.

Strategy E — Targeted boundary augmentation + automated threshold search
- New operations: automatic generation of synthetic examples near current decision boundaries (perturb inputs around thresholds/gaps).
- Logical structure: run a small automatic search (grid or Bayesian) to tune key thresholds (e.g., C*D cutoff, sum cutoff, gap_ratio) using augmented data, focusing on reducing errors near boundaries rather than extremes.
- Alternative handling: this makes thresholds robust and prevents overfitting to a small set of exact exceptions.
- Novel interaction: combine synthetic training with a simple regularizer that penalizes large memorization lists and encourages general rule coverage.

Implementation priorities and evaluation plan
- First 2 experiments (highest expected payoff, quick to implement):
  1. Implement Strategy A (normalization + rank) + Strategy B (systematic pairwise interactions). These directly address near-ties and mid-range ambiguity and exploit already-successful multiplicative signal (C*D).
  2. Run focused cross-validation on boundary regions and measure change in accuracy on previously misclassified mid-range cases.
- Next batch:
  3. Build the hierarchical ensemble (Strategy C) and add abstention/confidence voting. Keep memorization as a last-resort lookup only.
  4. Try Strategy E (boundary augmentation) to tune thresholds discovered in steps above.
- Exploratory (parallel if resources permit):
  5. Probe Strategy D (modular/bitwise) for any latent discrete patterns — low implementation cost, potentially high payoff for rare cases.

Operational constraints and guardrails
- Limit memorization size and only preserve rows that truly are ambiguous and cannot be generalized through new features.
- Track per-module confidence and errors per region (extreme vs mid-range vs near-tie) to know which specialist to improve.
- Keep experiments small and track incremental gains; prefer strategies that increase average accuracy and reduce variance across folds.

Expected outcomes
- Normalization and ratio features + polynomial interactions should reduce mid-range and tie errors and give a 3–6% absolute accuracy gain if the underlying data is relative rather than absolute-driven.
- Hierarchical gating and boundary augmentation should improve robustness and reduce the need for memorized exceptions.
- Modular bitwise probes are lower probability but cheap to test; if any periodic/categorical signal exists, they can produce a targeted boost.

Next-cycle concrete checklist
- Add normalized features, top-k rank features, pairwise ratios.
- Expand multiplicative interactions: A*B, B*C, A*B*C, C^2, C^2*D; set up thresholds as tunable parameters.
- Implement gating ensemble with confidence voting and memorize-as-last-resort.
- Generate synthetic examples near current decision boundaries and re-tune thresholds.
- Optionally implement modular residue checks and run a sweep for informative residues.

This plan balances immediate, high-leverage changes (normalization, interactions, gating) with some lower-cost experimental probes (modular checks, augmentation). It keeps memorization ephemeral and focuses on creating robust, interpretable rules that generalize beyond the exact examples preserved in Cycle 21.
