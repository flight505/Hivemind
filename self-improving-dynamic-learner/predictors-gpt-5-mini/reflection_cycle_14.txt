================================================================================

Summary
- Cycle 14 produced a best function at 57.57% (average 49.22%). The function’s strongest ideas were exploiting dominant-variable regimes, multiplicative interactions (especially C*D), and a compact weighted linear score plus many hand-tuned thresholds. You preserved 3 cross-cycle exemplars; memorization helped fit known rows but generalization remains the goal.

Reflection (by requested aspects)

1. Patterns Observed
- Dominance / argmax regimes are informative: the identity of the largest value often implies a class, especially when the gap to the next value is large.
- Multiplicative interactions (notably C * D) capture strong joint effects that simple sums miss — these often map to class 1 in the current function.
- Simple weighted linear scoring (0.44A + 0.3B + 0.16C + 0.06D + 0.04E) provides a useful global bias/tie-breaker when magnitudes are moderate.
- Threshold clusters (e.g., A+B bulk, high E dominance, very high C with tiny D) create distinct regimes that rules can exploit.

2. Failure Analysis
- Near-tie / low-gap regions are still fragile: small changes in value order frequently lead to wrong class due to brittle thresholds.
- Conflicting signals: e.g., very high C but tiny D, or high E that is overridden by moderate mass elsewhere — the function sometimes applies the wrong override.
- Rare or boundary patterns are poorly covered by rules (the function relies on memorized examples for some isolated cases).
- Overfitting to ad-hoc thresholds: many hand-chosen cutoffs generalize poorly across less-sampled regimes.

3. Innovation Opportunities (not fully explored)
- Ratio features and normalized interactions (A/B, A/(sum+1), C/D, CD/(sum+1)) to capture relative dominance instead of absolute thresholds.
- Rank-based features: position of each variable in the sorted order, or averages of top-k elements, instead of raw values.
- Piecewise-linear scoring that is conditional on regime (e.g., different weight sets when argmax is C vs argmax is E).
- Prototype / exemplar similarity (k-NN-like) using a learned distance metric, to reduce brittle thresholds and benefit from memorized samples without strict exact matching.
- Modular/digit-level or parity features and GCD-related transforms (sometimes tasks encode class signals into units digits or parity).

4. Strategic Direction (priorities)
- Prioritize replacing brittle many-threshold rules with a small set of regime detectors (argmax + margin) that select specialized scoring models per regime.
- Expand feature space with robust relative features (ratios, normalized products, ranks).
- Introduce exemplar-based fallback (nearest-neighbor among preserved examples) to handle rare patterns, while keeping a compact parametric fallback for general cases.
- Automate threshold tuning via search (grid/hillclimb/evolutionary) instead of manual tuning to reduce overfitting.
- Target near-tie and conflicting-signal cases first — these are a large source of errors.

Creative Planning — 4 Specific Strategies to Explore in Next Cycle

Strategy 1 — Regime-Conditional Scoring (Hierarchical piecewise models)
- Idea: First determine a regime using robust tests: argmax (which variable is largest) plus margin = (max - second_max)/(max+1). Use 3 regime buckets: clear-dominant, near-tie, and balanced multi-high (sum/top-3 high).
- For each regime, apply a small linear model with regime-specific weights and a small set of interaction terms (e.g., for C-dominant regime use weights emphasizing C and C*D; for E-dominant use E, E/(sum+1), and parity of E).
- Implement soft tie-handling: if margin < threshold, blend the outputs of top-two regime models via weighted voting instead of hard switching.
- Benefit: reduces global threshold complexity by tailoring decision surfaces to homogeneous subspaces.

Strategy 2 — Expanded Interaction & Normalized Features
- New features to add: pairwise ratios (A/B, B/A, C/D), normalized products (A*B/(s+1), C*D/(s+1)), top-2 mean, top-3 sum, counts of variables >= X (for a few X values like 40, 60, 80).
- Use these as rule triggers and in scoring functions. For example, require C*D/(s+1) above a small threshold for class 1 instead of raw CD >= 3000 to make it scale-aware.
- Add relative dominance features like A/(max+1) and (max - second_max) absolute and relative.
- Benefit: captures relative importance and keeps rules valid across different magnitude scales.

Strategy 3 — Prototype + Distance-Based Fall‑Back
- Maintain a small set of prototypes per class (pick representative examples or keep cross-cycle exemplars). For a new input compute a weighted distance (e.g., normalized L1 or L2 with feature-wise scales) to prototypes and consider prototype vote when distance < D_threshold.
- Combine prototype vote with parametric rule confidence: if parametric rule confidence is low (near-tie or score in narrow band), rely on prototype vote.
- Also explore a learned per-feature scale (simple tuning) to align distance metric with feature importance.
- Benefit: reduces gross mistakes on rare patterns and leverages memorized examples without full memorization.

Strategy 4 — Automated Threshold/Weight Search and Simplification
- Replace many hand-chosen cutoffs with a small set of tunable parameters: regime margin thresholds, a few product/ratio cutoffs, and 3–5 linear weights per regime.
- Optimize these parameters using a gradient-free search (evolutionary strategy, simulated annealing, or coordinate hillclimb) over the validation set. Use cross-cycle preserved examples as part of the tuning set.
- Add a complexity penalty to prefer simple rules (fewer active thresholds) to encourage generalization.
- Benefit: reduces ad-hoc tuning and finds more robust boundaries.

Optional Strategy 5 — Feature-Engineering for Edge Cases (Digit / Mod / Parity)
- For ambiguous or small-scale patterns, add low-cost transforms: units digit of each variable, parity (even/odd), and GCD of pairs. Create features like identical-units-count (how many inputs share same last digit), or high-GCD pairs — these sometimes encode hidden labeling schemes.
- Use these only in fallback rules (when parametric confidence is low) to avoid overfitting.

How to handle challenging input patterns practically
- Identify the “low-confidence” band explicitly (e.g., score in [x,y], margin < m, sum in certain band) and route those inputs to specialized handlers: prototype lookup, parity/digit checks, or blended regime models.
- Maintain a small exception memory: store misclassified examples from each cycle and prioritize creating prototype representatives for those regions.
- Use rank/percentile normalization across inputs to reduce sensitivity to absolute scales.

Evaluation / Implementation Plan for next cycle
- Implement Regime-Conditional Scoring + Expanded Interaction features first (largest expected payoff).
- Add prototype fallback and then run parameter search to tune regime thresholds and a few weights.
- Track improvements on three slices specifically: near-tie inputs, C-high/D-low conflicts, and E-high but low-sum cases. Use confusion analysis to iterate.
- Keep cross-cycle exemplar budget slightly higher (e.g., 8–12) and ensure prototypes are selected to cover boundary cases.

Concluding priorities for Cycle 15
1. Build regime detector (argmax + margin) and define 3 regime models.
2. Add normalized interaction features (ratios, products/(sum+1), top-k means).
3. Implement prototype fallback and a small distance metric with tunable scales.
4. Run automated parameter search to replace manual thresholds, with a simplicity penalty.
5. Focus targeted testing on near-tie and conflicting-signal cases; measure per-regime accuracy as well as overall.

These steps should reduce brittle thresholding, exploit multiplicative structure more robustly, and improve generalization while retaining the best ad-hoc heuristics discovered so far.
