STRATEGIC REFLECTION

1) Patterns observed
- C is the dominant driver. Very low C reliably indicates class 3; low-to-moderate C with strong E and low D often indicates class 4; very high C with either low D or very strong B ties to class 2.
- D behaves like a regulator/friction term: low D enables 2 or 4; high D suppresses them.
- E acts as an amplifier: extremely high E with low D pushes to 4 even when C is not extreme.
- B only helped when extremely high; otherwise it was effectively ignored.
- A was unused; that is likely leaving accuracy on the table.

2) Failure analysis
- The mid-C band (roughly 25–78) was largely defaulted to class 1, likely causing many errors.
- Conflicting signals were not handled: e.g., high E but only mid D; high C with mid D; low C but D not low enough.
- Hard thresholds without buffers mis-handle boundary values (e.g., C near 25 or 78).
- Class 3 detection may be too narrow (only C ≤ 12), missing cases where “low C + high D” might also indicate 3.
- Overreliance on a single default class (1) likely mirrors class imbalance instead of structure.

3) Innovation opportunities
- Introduce relative features and interactions: differences (E − D, C − D, B − C), ratios (E/(D+1), D/(C+1)), composites (C + E − D).
- Add a voting/score mechanism instead of one-shot thresholds to blend multiple weak signals.
- Use banded logic for C with context-aware tie-breakers near boundaries.
- Incorporate A as a modulator in ambiguous regions (e.g., mid C).
- Two-stage/hierarchical decisions: first isolate strong class 4 or 3 signatures, then refine 1 vs 2.

4) Strategic direction
- Prioritize resolving the mid-C region with composite scores and voting.
- Strengthen class 4 detection using E vs D contrast (not just absolute E).
- Broaden class 3 detection beyond “very low C” by considering C relative to D and B.
- Bring A into play in tie-breakers and mid-band decisions.
- Replace the single default with a principled tie-break (votes or secondary scores).


CREATIVE PLANNING FOR NEXT CYCLE

1) Two-stage hierarchical gating with contrast metrics
- Stage 1: Detect class 4 via contrast, not just raw E:
  - Core signals: E − D large, or E/(D+1) above a threshold; optionally require C not extremely high.
  - Add a buffer: if E − D is near threshold, require an additional confirmatory condition (e.g., B or C supportive).
- Stage 2: On remaining cases, use a composite score S = α·C − β·D + γ·B + δ·A to separate 1/2/3:
  - High S ⇒ favor class 2; very low S ⇒ favor class 3; mid S ⇒ class 1 with tie-breaks.
- New operations to try: linear combos (C − D, E − D), ratio tests (E/(D+1)), buffered thresholds (±3–5).

2) Relative-difference and ratio feature rules
- Build rules around:
  - C − D: if strongly negative, push to class 3; if strongly positive with B supportive, push to class 2.
  - E − D and E/(D+1): larger values to class 4.
  - B − C: if B greatly exceeds C, nudge toward class 2 in mid C.
- Handle challenging inputs:
  - When absolute values are mid-range, rely on contrasts (differences/ratios) rather than absolutes.
- New operations: signed differences, normalized ratios, capped denominators (+1) to avoid division issues.

3) Voting/score aggregation across weak signals
- For each class, define 2–4 simple “votes”:
  - Class 4 votes: E high, E − D high, D low, E/(D+1) high.
  - Class 2 votes: C high, C − D high, B high, A high.
  - Class 3 votes: C low, D high relative to C, B low.
  - Class 1 votes: none of the above or mid-band consistency.
- Predict the class with the most votes; break ties by class-specific priority (e.g., if E extremely high, prefer 4; if C very low, prefer 3).
- Benefit: reduces brittleness of single-cut thresholds and improves decisions in mixed-signal regions.

4) Banded C with boundary-aware tie-breakers and A as modulator
- Partition C into bands (very low, low, mid, high, very high).
  - Very low: prioritize 3 unless E − D strongly favors 4.
  - Low: allow 4 when E outpaces D; otherwise 1/3 based on D and B.
  - Mid: use A and B as modulators (e.g., high A or B nudges to 2; high D nudges to 3; otherwise 1).
  - High/very high: choose between 2 and 4 using D and E − D (low D ⇒ 2; high E − D ⇒ 4).
- Add boundary buffers (±3–5 around band edges) to trigger tie-break rules using differences/ratios.
- New structures: conditional banding with fallback tie-break logic, explicit boundary zones.

5) Dominance and max/min feature logic
- Determine dominant feature magnitude and its margin over the next largest:
  - If E is dominant by a clear margin and D not high, push to 4.
  - If C dominates and D is low, push to 2; if D dominates while C is low, push to 3.
- Use max/min and margin thresholds to catch cases missed by simple thresholds.
- New operations: max(A,B,C,D,E), second-max, dominance margin (max − second_max).

Prioritization for the next cycle
1) Implement E vs D contrast-driven class 4 detector with buffering.
2) Replace the “default to 1” branch with a vote-based tie-break across 1/2/3 using C − D, B, and A.
3) Expand class 3 detection to include “low C and high D relative to C,” not just C ≤ 12.
4) Introduce C-banded logic with boundary-aware tie-breakers.
5) Systematically bring A into mid-band and tie-break decisions.

These steps target the biggest current gaps (mid-C ambiguity, brittle thresholds, unused A) while keeping the rules interpretable and efficient.
