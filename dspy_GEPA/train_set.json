    "solution": "We have the following diagram:\n\nLet $X$ and $W$ be the points where $AP$ and $BQ$ extend to meet $CD$, and $YZ$ be the height of $\\triangle AZB$. As proven in Solution 2, triangles $APD$ and $DPW$ are congruent right triangles. Therefore, $AD = DW = 333$. We can apply this logic to triangles $BCQ$ and $XCQ$ as well, giving us $BC = CX = 333$. Since $CD = 650$, $XW = DW + CX - CD = 16$.\nAdditionally, we can see that $\\triangle XZW$ is similar to $\\triangle PQZ$ and $\\triangle AZB$. We know that $\\frac{XW}{AB} = \\frac{16}{500}$. So, we can say that the height of the triangle $AZB$ is $500u$ while the height of the triangle $XZW$ is $16u$. After that, we can figure out the distance from $Y$ to $PQ: \\frac{500+16}{2} = 258u$ and the height of triangle $PZQ: 500-258 = 242u$.\nFinally, since the ratio between the height of $PZQ$ to the height of $AZB$ is $242:500$ and $AB$ is $500$, $PQ = \\boxed{242}.$\n~Cytronical\nExtend line $PQ$ to meet $AD$ at $P'$ and $BC$ at $Q'$.

Therefore, $\\angle PAB \\cong \\angle APP'$ by interior angles and $\\angle PAB \\cong \\angle PAD$ by the problem statement. Thus, $\\triangle P'AP$ is isosceles with $P'P = P'A$. By symmetry, $P'DP$ is also isosceles, and thus $P'A = \\frac{AD}{2}$. Similarly, the same thing is happening on the right side of the trapezoid, and thus $P'Q'$ is the midline of the trapezoid. Then, $PQ = P'Q' - (P'P + Q'Q)$.\nSince $P'P = P'A = \\frac{AD}{2}, Q'Q = Q'B = \\frac{BC}{2}$ and $AD = BC = 333$, we have $P'P + Q'Q = \\frac{333}{2} + \\frac{333}{2} = 333$. The length of the midline of a trapezoid is the average of their bases, so $P'Q' = \\frac{500+650}{2} = 575$. Finally, $PQ = 575 - 333 = \\boxed{242}$.\n~KingRavi\nWe have the following diagram:\n\nExtend lines $AP$ and $BQ$ to meet line $DC$ at points $W$ and $X$, respectively, and extend lines $DP$ and $CQ$ to meet $AB$ at points $Z$ and $Y$, respectively.\nClaim: quadrilaterals $AZWD$ and $BYXC$ are rhombuses.\nProof: Since $\\angle DAB + \\angle ADC = 180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle ADP + \\angle PAD = 90^{\\circ}$. Therefore, triangles $APD$, $APZ$, $DPW$ and $PZW$ are all right triangles. By SAA congruence, the first three triangles are congruent; by SAS congruence, $\\triangle PZW$ is congruent to the other three. Therefore, $AD = DW = WZ = AZ$, so $AZWD$ is a rhombus. By symmetry, $BYXC$ is also a rhombus.\nExtend line $PQ$ to meet $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $R$ and $S$, respectively. Because of rhombus properties, $RP = QS = \\frac{333}{2}$. Also, by rhombus properties, $R$ and $S$ are the midpoints of segments $AD$ and $BC$, respectively; therefore, by trapezoid properties, $RS = \\frac{AB + CD}{2} = 575$. Finally, $PQ = RS - RP - QS = \\boxed{242}$.\n~ihatemath123\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be the feet of the altitudes from $P$ and $Q$, respectively, to $AB$, and let $Z$ and $W$ be the feet of the altitudes from $P$ and $Q$, respectively, to $CD$. Side $AB$ is parallel to side $CD$, so $XYWZ$ is a rectangle with width $PQ$. Furthermore, because $CD - AB = 650-500 = 150$ and trapezoid $ABCD$ is isosceles, $WC - YB = ZD - XA = 75$. \nAlso because $ABCD$ is isosceles, $\\angle ABC + \\angle BCD$ is half the total sum of angles in $ABCD$, or $180^{\\circ}$. Since $BQ$ and $CQ$ bisect $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle BCD$, respectively, we have $\\angle QBC + \\angle QCB = 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$. \nLetting $BQ = 333k$, applying Pythagoras to $\\triangle BQC$ yields $QC = 333\\sqrt{1-k^2}$. We then proceed using similar triangles: $\\angle BYQ = \\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle YBQ = \\angle QBC$, so by AA similarity $YB = 333k^2$. Likewise, $\\angle CWQ = \\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle WCQ = \\angle QCB$, so by AA similarity $WC = 333(1 - k^2)$. Thus $WC + YB = 333$.\nAdding our two equations for $WC$ and $YB$ gives $2WC = 75 + 333 = 408$. Therefore, the answer is $PQ = ZW = CD - 2WC = 650 - 408 = \\boxed{242}$.\n~Orange_Quail_9\nThis will be my first solution on AoPS. My apologies in advance for any errors. \nAngle bisectors can be thought of as the locus of all points equidistant from the lines whose angle they bisect. It can thus be seen that $P$ is equidistant from  $AB, AD,$ and $CD$ and $Q$ is equidistant from  $AB, BC,$ and $CD.$ If we let the feet of the altitudes from $P$ to $AB, AD,$ and $CD$ be called $E, F,$ and $G$ respectively, we can say that $PE = PF = PG.$ Analogously, we let the feet of the altitudes from $Q$ to $AB, BC,$ and $CD$ be $H, I,$ and $J$ respectively. Thus, $QH = QI = QJ.$ Because $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid, we can say that all of the altitudes are equal to each other. \nBy SA as well as SS congruence for right triangles, we find that triangles $AEP, AFP, BHQ,$ and $BIQ$ are congruent. Similarly, $DFP, DGP, CJQ,$ and $CIQ$ by the same reasoning. Additionally, $EH = GJ = PQ$ since $EHQP$ and $GJQP$ are congruent rectangles. \nIf we then let $x = AE = AF = BH = BI,$ let $y = CI = CJ = DG = DF,$ and let $z = EH = GJ = PQ,$ we can create the following system of equations with the given side length information:\n\\begin{align*} 2x + z &= 500, \\\\ 2y + z &= 650, \\\\ x + y &= 333. \\end{align*}\nAdding the first two equations, subtracting by twice the second, and dividing by $2$ yields $z = PQ = \\boxed{242}.$\n~regular\nExtend line $PQ$ to meet $AD$ at $P'$ and $BC$ at $Q'$.

Thus, $\\angle APD = \\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$, implying that $\\triangle APD$ and $\\triangle BQC$ are right triangles. Since $P'P$ and $Q'Q$ are medians, $P'P+Q'Q=\\frac{333\\times2}{2}=333$. Since $P'Q'=\\frac{500+650}{2}=575$, we have $PQ+P'P+Q'Q=575$, or $PQ=575-333=\\boxed{242}$.\n~sigma\nLet $PQ = x$. Note that since $AP$ bisects $\\angle{A}$ and $DP$ bisects $\\angle{D}$, we have \\[\\angle{APD} = 180^{\\circ}-\\tfrac12 \\angle{A}-\\tfrac12 \\angle{D}=90^{\\circ}.\\] Let $\\angle{ADP}=\\theta$. We have that $\\angle{ADC} = 2\\theta.$ Now, drop an altitude from $A$ to $CD$ at $E$. Notice that $DE=\\tfrac{650-500}{2}=75$. By the definition of cosine, we have \\[\\cos{2\\theta}=1-2\\cos^2{\\theta}=\\tfrac{75}{333}=\\tfrac{25}{111} \\implies \\cos{\\theta}=\\tfrac{2\\sqrt{1887}}{111}.\\] Notice, however, that we can also apply this to $\\triangle{APD}$; we have \\[\\cos{\\theta}=\\tfrac{DP}{333} \\implies DP=6\\sqrt{1887}.\\] By the Pythagorean Theorem, we get \\[AP=\\sqrt{333^2-(6\\sqrt{1887})^2}=3\\sqrt{4773}.\\] Then, drop an altitude from $P$ to $AB$ at $F$; if $AF=y$, then $PQ=x=500-2y$. Because $AP$ is an angle bisector, we see that $\\angle{BAP}=\\angle{DAP}=90^{\\circ}-\\theta$. Again, by the definition of cosine, we have \\[\\cos{(90^{\\circ}-\\theta)}=\\sin{\\theta}=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{4773}}{111}=\\tfrac{y}{3\\sqrt{4773}} \\implies y=129.\\] Finally, $PQ=500-2y=\\boxed{242}$.\n~pqr.\nAs in solution 4, $\\angle APD = 90^{\\circ}$. Set $k = AX$ and $x = DP$.\nWe know that $DZ = AX + \\frac{DC-AB}{2}$, so $DZ = k + \\frac{650-500}{2} = k + 75$.\n$\\triangle DPZ \\sim \\triangle APD$ by AA, so we have $\\frac{PD}{AD} = \\frac{ZD}{PD}$, resulting in\n\\[\\frac{x}{333} = \\frac{k+75}{x} \\text{ (1)}\\]\n$\\triangle APX \\sim \\triangle ADP$ by AA, so we have $\\frac{AP}{AD} = \\frac{AX}{AP}$, resulting in\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{333^2-x^2}}{333} = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{333^2-k^2}} \\text{ (2)}\\]\nFrom $\\text{(1)}$, we have $x^2 = 333k + 333(75) = 333k + 24975$. From $\\text{(2)}$, we have $333^2 - x^2 = 333k$, or $x^2 = 333^2 - 333k$. Thus, $333k + 24975 = 333^2 - 333k$. Solving for $k$ yields $k = 129$.\nBy symmetry, $YB = AX = 129$. Thus, $PQ = XY = AB - 2AX = 500 - 2(129) = \\boxed{242}$.\n~ adam_zheng",

The difference between $99$ and $71$ is $28$, which is a multiple of $4$. So, if we multiply this by $2$, it will be a multiple of $8$ and thus the gap can be filled.

Since $b$ and $c$ are base-$9$ digits, we can say that $b+c = 0$ or $b+c=9$.  The former possibility can be easily eliminated, and thus $b+c=9$.  Next, we write the equation from Solution 1 as $99a = 63b + 8(b+c)$, and dividing this by $9$ gives $11a = 7b+8$.  Taking both sides modulo $7$, we have $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives $a\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, which implies $a=2$.  From here, we can find that $b=2$ and $c=7$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{227}$.\n~Sedro",

Simply observing, we see that the only line segments that don't intersect with the new lines are lines attached to some point that a new line does not pass through. If we look at a series of points on line $\\ell_B$ from left to right and a line connects $P$ to an arbitrary point, then the lines formed with that point and with remaining points on the left of that point never intersect with the line with $P$. Let there be $s$ points on lines $\\ell_A$ and $\\ell_B$ before $P$ was added. For each of the $s$ points on $\\ell_B$, we subtract the total number of lines formed, which is $s^2$, not counting $P$. Considering all possible points on $\\ell_B$, we get $(s^2-s)+(s^2-2s)\\cdots(s^2-s^2)$ total intersections. However, for each of the lines, there is one more bounded region than number of intersections, so we add $s$. Simplifying, we get $s^3-s\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+s\\Longrightarrow s(s^2-\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+1)$. Note that this is only a recursion formula to find the number of new regions added for a new point $P$ added to $\\ell_A$.\nCase 2:  If a new point $P$ is added to the right of a line that has one less point than the other line.\nContinuing on case one, let this point $P$ be on line $\\ell_B$. With similar reasoning, we see that the idea remains the same, except $s+1$ lines are formed with $P$ instead of just $s$ lines. Once again, each line from $P$ to a point on line $\\ell_A$ creates $s$ non-intersecting lines for that point and each point to its left. Subtracting from $s(s+1)$ lines and considering all possible lines created by $P$, we get $(s(s+1)-s)+(s(s+1)-2s)\\cdots(s(s+1)-s(s+1)$ intersections. However, the number of newly bounded regions is the number of intersections plus the number of points on line $\\ell_A$. Simplying, we get $s(s+1)^2-s\\sum_{i=1}^{s+1}{i}+(s+1)$ newly bounded regions.\nFor the base case $s=2$ for both lines, there are $4$ bounded regions. Next, we plug in $s=2,3,4$ for both formulas and plug $s=5$ for the first formula to find the number of regions when $m=6$ and $n=5$. Notice that adding a final point on $\\ell_A$ is a variation of our Case 1. The only difference is for each of the $s$ lines formed by $P$, there are $s+1$ points that can form a non-intersecting line. Therefore, we are subtracting a factor of $s+1$ lines instead of $s$ lines from a total of $s(s+1)$ lines. However, the number of lines formed by $P$ remains the same so we still add $s$ at the end when considering intersection points. Thus, the recursive equation becomes $(s(s+1)-(s+1))+(s(s+1)-2(s+1))\\cdots(s(s+1)-s(s+1))+s\\Longrightarrow s^2(s+1)-(s+1)\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+s$. Plugging $s=5$ into this formula and adding the values we obtained from the other formulas, the final answer is $4+4+9+12+22+28+45+55+65=\\boxed{244}$.\n~[Magnetoninja](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Magnetoninja)\nWe know the by Euler's Formula for planar graphs that $F-E+V=2$, where $F$ is the number of bounded faces, plus the outer region, $E$ is the number of edges, and $V$ is the number of vertices. Temporarily disregarding the intersections between the lines, we can easily calculate that:\n$V_{i}=7+5=12$\n$E_{i}=6+4+7\\cdot5=45$\nHowever, the resulting graph is not planar, as the edges clearly intersect. To account for this, we must turn all intersection points into vertices, and update our values accordingly.\nObserve that each intersection point can be mapped to two points on either line, and analogously, two points on either line can be mapped to one intersection point, uniquely. Thus, to count intersection points, we simply calculate:\n${7 \\choose 2}{5 \\choose 2} = 210$\nAnd thus,\n$V=V_{i}+210=222$\nWe must also account for the edges. Observe that each intersection point turns the two edges that make it into four, that is, each intersection point adds $2$ to the number of edges. Therefore,\n$E=E_{i}+2\\cdot210=465$\nPlugging these into Euler's Formula we get:\n$F-E+V=2$\n$F-465+222=2$\n$F=245$\nDisregarding the outer region, we conclude that our answer is $F-1=245-1=\\boxed {244}$\n~[Shadowleafy](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Shadowleafy)",

    "solution": "Plugging $2$ and $m$ into $P(x)$ and equating them, we get $8+4a+2b+c = m^3+am^2+bm+c$. Rearranging, we have \\[(m^3-8) + (m^2 - 4)a + (m-2)b = 0.\\] Note that the value of $c$ won't matter as it can be anything in the provided range, giving a total of $41$ possible choices for $c.$ So what we just need to do is to just find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ that work, and multiply it by $41.$\nWe can start by first dividing both sides by $m-2.$ (Note that this is valid since $m\\neq2:$ \\[m^2 + 2m + 4 + (m+2)a + b = 0.\\] We can rearrange this so it is a quadratic in $m$: \\[m^2 + (a+2)m + (4 + 2a + b) = 0.\\] Remember that $m$ has to be unique and not equal to $2.$ We can split this into two cases: case $1$ being that $m$ has exactly one solution, and it isn't equal to $2$; case $2$ being that $m$ has two solutions, one being equal to $2,$ but the other is a unique solution not equal to $2.$\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1:}$\nThere is exactly one solution for $m,$ and that solution is not $2.$ This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is $0,$ using that, we have $(a+2)^2 = 4(4 + 2a + b),$ rearranging in a neat way, we have \\[(a-2)^2 = 4(4 + b)\\Longrightarrow a = 2\\pm2\\sqrt{4+b}.\\] Using the fact that $4+b$ must be a perfect square, we can easily see that the values for $b$ can be $-4, -3, 0, 5,$ and $12.$ Also since it's a \"$\\pm$\" there will usually be $2$ solutions for $a$ for each value of $b.$ The two exceptions for this would be if $b = -4$ and $b = 12.$ For $b=-4$ because it would be a $\\pm0,$ which only gives one solution, instead of two. And for $b=12$ because then $a = -6$ and the solution for $m$ would equal to $2,$ and we don't want this. (We can know this by putting the solutions back into the quadratic formula). \nSo we have $5$ solutions for $b,$ each of which give $2$ values for $a,$ except for $2,$ which only give one. So in total, there are $5*2 - 2 = 8$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ in this case.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2:}$\n$m$ has two solutions, but exactly one of them isn't equal to $2.$ This ensures that $1$ of the solutions is equal to $2.$\nLet $r$ be the other value of $m$ that isn't $2.$ By Vieta: \n\\begin{align*} r+2 &= -a-2\\\\ 2r &= 4+2a+b. \\end{align*} From the first equation, we subtract both sides by $2$ and double both sides to get $2r = -2a - 8$ which also equals to $4+2a+b$ from the second equation. Equating both, we have $4a + b + 12 = 0.$ We can easily count that there would be $11$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy that.\nHowever, there's an outlier case in which $r$ happens to also equal to $2,$ and we don't want that. We can reverse engineer and find out that $r=2$ when $(a,b) = (-6, 12),$ which we overcounted. So we subtract by one and we conclude that there are $10$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ that satisfy this case.\n\nThis all shows that there are a total of $8+10 = 18$ amount of ordered pairs $(a,b).$ Multiplying this by $41$ (the amount of values for $c$) we get $18\\cdot41=\\boxed{738}$ as our final answer.\n~s214425\n$p(x)-p(2)$ is a cubic with at least two integral real roots, therefore it has three real roots, which are all integers.\nThere are exactly two distinct roots, so either $p(x)=p(2)+(x-2)^2(x-m)$ or $p(x)=p(2)+(x-2)(x-m)^2$, with $m\\neq 2$.\nIn the first case $p(x)=x^3-(4+m)x^2+(4+4m)x-4m+p(2)$, with $|4+4m|\\leq 20$ (which entails $|4+m|\\leq 20$), so $m$ can be $-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1, (\\textbf{not 2}!), 3,4$ and $-4m+p(2)$ can be any integer from $-20$ to $20$, giving $410$ polynomials (since the coefficients are given by linear functions of $m$ and thus are distinct). \nIn the second case $p(x)=x^3-(2+2m)x^2+(4m+m^2)x-2m^2+p(2)$, and $m$ can be $-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1$ and $-4m+p(2)$ can be any integer from $-20$ to $20$, giving $328$ polynomials.\nThe total is $\\boxed{738}$.\n~EVIN-",

Similarly, sequences with {30,40} and {40,50} will not give us any subtractions because those sequences must all include a 20. Let's stick with the lower ones for a minute: if we take them two at a time, then {3,5} will give us the subtraction of 1 sequence {3,5,7,9}. We have exhausted all pairs of numbers we can take, and if we take the triplet of single digit numbers, the only possible sequence must have a 6, which we already don't count. Therefore, we subtract $\\textbf{1}$ from the count of illegal sequences with any of the single-digit numbers and none of the numbers 30,40,50.\n(Note if we take only 1 at a time, there will have to be 3 of $a, b$, which is impossible.)\nIf we have the sequence including {30,50}, we end up having negative values, so these do not give us any subtractions, and the triplet {30,40,50} gives us a 20. Hence by the same reasoning as earlier, we have 0 subtractions from the sequences with these numbers and none of the single digit numbers {3,4,5}.\nFinally, we count the sequences that are something like (one of 3,4,5,), $a, b$, (one of 30, 40, 50). If this is to be the case, then let $a$ be the starting value in the sequence. The sequence will be $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$; We see that if we subtract the largest term by the smallest term we have $3d$, so the subtraction of one of (30,40,50) and one of (3,4,5) must be divisible by 3. Therefore the only sequences possible are $3,a,b,30; 4,a,b,40; 5,a,b,50$. Of these, only the last is invalid because it gives $b = 35$, larger than our bounds $6<a<b<30$.

Adding these up, there are 2024 (wow! the year!) items in total. Thus, $w+2x+3y+4z=2024$ since we are adding the number of items each group of people contributes, and this must be equal to the total number of items. \nPlugging in x and y once more, we get $w+4z=448$.

We also know $a+b+c=437$ (the number of people that own two objects), and $x+y+z=234$ (the number of people that own three objects).

There are 437 people who owns 2 items, which means 1 item since candy hearts are irrelevant, and there are 234 people who own 2 items plus a bag of candy hearts, which means that the 234 people collectively own $234*2=468$ items. We can see that there are $1124-437-468=219$ items left, and since the question is asking us for the people who own 4 items, which means 3 items due to the irrelevance of candy hearts, we simply divide 219 by 3 and get $219/3=\\boxed{073}$.\n~Callisto531\nLet $a$ be the number of people who have exactly one of these things and let $b$ be the number of people who have exactlty four of these objects.

    "solution": "We break the problem into stages, one for each card revealed, then further into cases based on the number of remaining unrevealed cards of each color. Since [expected value](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Expected_value) is linear, the expected value of the total number of correct card color guesses across all stages is the sum of the expected values of the number of correct card color guesses at each stage; that is, we add the probabilities of correctly guessing the color at each stage to get the final answer (See [https://brilliant.org/wiki/linearity-of-expectation/](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://brilliant.org/wiki/linearity-of-expectation/))\nAt any stage, if there are $a$ unrevealed cards of one color and $b$ of the other color, and $a \\geq b$, then the optimal strategy is to guess the color with $a$ unrevealed cards, which succeeds with probability $\\frac{a}{a+b}.$\nStage 1:\nThere are always $3$ unrevealed cards of each color, so the probability of guessing correctly is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStage 2:\nThere is always a $3$-$2$ split ($3$ unrevealed cards of one color and $2$ of the other color), so the probability of guessing correctly is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\nStage 3:\nThere are now $2$ cases:\n\n\n The guess from Stage 2 was correct, so there is now a $2$-$2$ split of cards and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of guessing the color of the third card correctly.\n The guess from Stage 2 was incorrect, so the split is $3$-$1$ and the probability of guessing correctly is $\\frac{3}{4}$. \n\nThus, the overall probability of guessing correctly is $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\nStage 4:\nThis stage has $2$ cases as well:\n\n\n The guesses from both Stage 2 and Stage 3 were incorrect.

For the next card, Alice has a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance of guessing the card if she chooses black; if they guess right, there's one less red and black card, so the expected number of cards Alice guesses from here is $E_2$. If Alice does not guess correctly (which occurs with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$), this means that there's 3 black cards and 1 red card left, so Alice should guess black next with a $\\frac{3}{4}$ chance of being right. If Alice is wrong (with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$), there are only 3 black cards left, so Alice can guess these with certainty; if Alice is right, there are 2 blacks and 1 red left, so Alice should again guess black. If Alice is right (with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$), there is now 1 black and red card each, so the expected number of cards guessed is $E_1$; if she is wrong (with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$), there are 2 black cards left, so Alice can guess these with certainty.\nSumming this up into a formula:\n\\[E_3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{5} \\left(1 + E_2 \\right) + \\frac{2}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(3) + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(1 + E_1 \\right) + \\frac{1}{3}(2)\\right) \\right)\\]\nWe can apply similar logic to compute $E_2$ and get\n\\[E_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}(1 + E_1) + \\frac{1}{3}(2)\\]\nTo compute $E_1$, we know that Alice can guess the last card with certainty, and there's a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance they get the first card as well, so $E_1 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThus, $E_2 = \\frac{17}{6}$, and after long computation, we get $E_3 = \\frac{41}{10}$.

Furthermore, define $L_2$ to be the foot of the altitude from $Q$ to $BC$. From here, one can find $AL_1=12$, either using the 13-14-15 triangle or by calculating the area of $ABC$ two ways. Then, we find $BL_1=5$ and $L_1C = 9$ using Pythagorean theorem. Let $QL_2=x$. By AA similarity, $\\triangle{AL_1M}$ and $\\triangle{QL_2M}$ are similar. By similarity ratios, \\[\\frac{AL_1}{L_1M}=\\frac{QL_2}{L_2M}\\]\n\\[\\frac{12}{2}=\\frac{x}{L_2M}\\]\n\\[L_2M = \\frac{x}{6}\\]\nThus, $BL_2=BM-L_2M=7-\\frac{x}{6}$.

By Stewart's Theorem, $AM=\\sqrt{148}$, POP on $M$ tells $PM=\\frac{49}{\\sqrt{148}}$\nAs $QM=PM, AQ=AM-PM=\\frac{99}{\\sqrt{148}}$ leads to $\\boxed{247}$\n~bluesoul (supplemental note: ~Mathavi)\n$\\textbf{NOTE: Why BQCP is a parallelogram}$\nIt's not actually immediately clear why this is the case. There are two ways to easily show this:\n$\\textbf{Competition solution:}$\nNotice that the problem statement tells us that point Q is $\\textit{unique.}$ EVERY piece of information in the problem statement is intentional, so we should try to use this to our benefit. None of the other solutions do, which is why they are more complicated than they need be.\nConsider point Q' s.t. $Q'M = MP$. Obviously, $\\angle Q'CP$ and $\\angle Q'BP$ are equal - we have perfect symmetry along line $AP$. Moreover, $BQ'CP$ is a parallelogram as its diagonals bisect each other. Since point $Q$ is unique, we know that $Q' \\textit{is } Q$. Thus $BQCP$ is a parallelogram. $\\blacksquare$\n$\\newline$\n$\\textbf{Rigorous proof (not recommended for competition scenario):}$\nConsider any quadrilateral $ABCD$ whose diagonals intersect at $O$ s.t. $AO = OC$ and $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$. We will prove that $ABCD$ is $\\textit{either a \\textbf{parallelogram} or a \\textbf{kite}}$. \n(Note that in our problem, since $AP$ and $BC$ are not orthogonal, ($ABC$ isn't isosceles) this is enough to show that $BQCP$ is a parallelogram).\n$\\newline$\n-- By same base/same altitude, $[ABO] = [CBO]$ and $[ADO] = [CDO] \\implies [ABD] = [ABO] + [ADO] = [CBO] + [CDO] = [CBD]. \\newline$\nTherefore: $\\frac{1}{2} sin(\\angle BAD) \\overline{AB} \\times \\overline{AD} = \\frac{1}{2} sin(\\angle BCD) \\overline{CB} \\times \\overline{CD}.$ Since $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$, this reduces to $\\overline{AB} \\times \\overline{AD} = \\overline{CB} \\times \\overline{CD}. (E.1) \\newline$\nLet $AB = x$ and $AD = y$. Then, by $(E.1)$, $CB = kx$ and $CD = \\frac{y}{k}$ for some real $k$. Then by LoC on $\\triangle BAD$ and $\\triangle BCD$:\n$x^{2} + y^{2} - 2xy cos(\\angle BAD) = \\overline{BD} = x^{2}k^{2} + \\frac{y^{2}}{k^{2}} - 2xy cos(\\angle BCD) \\newline \\implies x^{2} + y^{2} = x^{2}k^{2} + \\frac{y^{2}}{k^{2}} \\newline \\implies (y^{2} - x^{2}k^{2})(k^{2} - 1) = 0.\\newline$\n-- $y^{2} - x^{2}k^{2} = 0 \\implies y = kx \\implies AD = BC$ and $AB = CD \\implies$ $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.\n-- $k^{2} - 1 = 0 \\implies k = 1$ ($k$ cannot be $-1$; no negative sided polygons here!) $\\implies AB = CB$ and $AD = CD \\implies$ $ABCD$ is a kite. $\\square$. ~Mathavi\nFirst, note that by Law of Sines, $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QBP})}{QP}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}$ and that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QCP})}{QP}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$. Equating the 2 expressions, you get that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$. Now drop the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. As it is commonly known that the dropped altitude forms a $5-12-13$ and a $9-12-15$ triangle, you get the measures of $\\angle{ABC}$ and $\\angle{ACB}$ respectively, which are $\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$ and $\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$. However, by the inscribed angle theorem, you get that $\\angle{BPQ}=\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$ and that $\\angle{QPC}=\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$, respectively. Therefore, by Law of Sines (as previously stated) $\\frac{BQ}{CQ}=\\frac{13}{15}$.\nNow commence coordbashing. Let $B$ be the origin, and $A$ be the point $(5,12)$. As $AP$ passes through $A$, which is $(5,12)$, and $M$, which is $(7,0)$, it has the equation $-6x+42$, so therefore a point on this line can be written as $(x,42-6x)$. As we have the ratio of the lengths, which prompts us to write the lengths in terms of the distance formula, we can just plug and chug it in to get the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{37x^2-504x+1764}}{\\sqrt{37x^2-532x+1960}}=\\frac{13}{15}$. This can be squared to get $\\frac{37x^2-504x+1764}{37x^2-532x+1960}=\\frac{169}{225}$. This can be solved to get a solution of $x=\\frac{469}{74}$, and an extraneous solution of $5$ which obviously doesn’t work. \nPlugging $x$ into the line equation gets you $y=\\frac{147}{37}$. The distance between this point and $A$, which is $(5,12)$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{9801}{148}}$, or simplified to $\\frac{99}{\\sqrt{148}}\\Longrightarrow99+148=\\boxed{247}$\n~dragoon (minor $\\LaTeX$ fixes by rhydon516)\n[2023 AIME II 12.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:2023_AIME_II_12.png)\nWe use the law of Cosine and get \\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 - 2 AM \\cdot BM \\cos \\angle AMB,\\] \\[AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 + 2 AM \\cdot CM \\cos \\angle AMB \\implies\\] \\[AM^2 = \\frac {AB^2 + AC^2}{2}- BM^2 = \\sqrt{148} \\approx 12.\\]\nWe use the power of point $M$ with respect circumcircle $\\triangle ABC$ and get \n\\[AM \\cdot MP = BM \\cdot CM = BM^2 \\implies\\]\n\\[PM = \\frac {49}{\\sqrt {148}} \\approx \\frac {48}{12} \\approx 4 < AM.\\]\nIt is clear that if $Q = P,$ then $\\angle PBQ = \\angle PCQ = 0 \\implies$\nif $Q$ is symmetric to $P$ with respect $M$ then $\\angle PBQ = \\angle PCQ.$\nThere exists a unique point $Q$ on segment $\\overline{AM}, PM < AM \\implies$\n\\[PQ = AM - PM = \\frac{99}{\\sqrt{148}} \\implies \\boxed{247}.\\]\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss",

This turns out to be easy by the formula $R=\\frac{abc}{4A}$, and through computing this value (the work has been left out) we find that $R=\\frac{17}4$, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{021}}$.\n~A1001\nBy the volume of a pyramid formula, we have that the height of the pyramid is $\\frac{9}{2}$. Since the base is a square with side length 6, the simplest way to place it in the coordinate plane is to put the center of the square at the origin and let the base be on the $xy$ plane. Then, the vertices of the base would be $(3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,3,0), (-3,-3,0)$ in some order. Also, let the vertex be  $(0,0,\\frac{9}{2})$. Recall that the formula for a sphere is $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=r^2$ where the center is $(a,b,c)$ and the radius is $r$. Symmetry gives that $a=b=0$. Plug in $(3,3,0)$ and $(0,0,\\frac{9}{2})$ and you get the system of equation \n$18+c^2=r^2$\n$(\\frac{9}{2}-c)^2=r^2$\nSolving gives $c=1/4$ and $r=17/4$, so our answer is $17+4=\\boxed{021}$.~[Ddk001](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ddk001)",

    "problem": "Find the number of collections of $16$ distinct subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ with the property that for any two subsets $X$ and $Y$ in the collection, $X \\cap Y \\not= \\emptyset.$",
    "solution": "Denote by $\\mathcal C$ a collection of 16 distinct subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$.\nDenote $N = \\min \\left\\{ |S|: S \\in \\mathcal C \\right\\}$.\nCase 1: $N = 0$.\nThis entails $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal C$.\nHence, for any other set $A \\in \\mathcal C$, we have $\\emptyset \\cap A = \\emptyset$. This is infeasible.\nCase 2: $N = 1$.\nLet $\\{a_1\\} \\in \\mathcal C$.\nTo get $\\{a_1\\} \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal C$.\nWe must have $a_1 \\in \\mathcal A$.\nThe total number of subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$ that contain $a_1$ is $2^4 = 16$.\nBecause $\\mathcal C$ contains 16 subsets.\nWe must have $\\mathcal C = \\left\\{ \\{a_1\\} \\cup A : \\forall \\ A \\subseteq \\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\} \\backslash \\left\\{a_1 \\right\\} \\right\\}$.\nTherefore, for any $X, Y \\in \\mathcal C$, we must have $X \\cap Y \\supseteq \\{a_1\\}$.\nSo this is feasible.\nNow, we count the number of $\\mathcal C$ in this case.\nWe only need to determine $a_1$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions is 5.\nCase 3: $N = 2$.\nCase 3.1: There is exactly one subset in $\\mathcal C$ that contains 2 elements.\nDenote this subset as $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$.\nWe then put all subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$ that

of $\\mathcal C$ in this case.\nWe only need to determine $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\nCase 3.2: There are exactly two subsets in $\\mathcal C$ that contain 2 elements.\nThey must take the form $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ a_1, a_3 \\right\\}$.\nWe then put all subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$

a_3 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_4 \\right\\}$.\nWe then put all subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\\mathcal C$, except $\\left\\{ a_3, a_4,

\\cdot \\binom{4}{3} = 20$.\nCase 3.4: There are exactly three subsets in $\\mathcal C$ that contain 2 elements.\nThey take the form $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_3 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_2, a_3 \\right\\}$.\nWe then put all subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\\mathcal C$, except $\\left\\{ a_3, a_4, a_5 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_2, a_4, a_5 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_4, a_5 \\right\\}$.\nThis satisfies $X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset$ for any $X, Y \\in \\mathcal C$.\nNow, we count the number of $\\mathcal C$ in this case.\nWe only need to determine $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_3 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_2, a_3 \\right\\}$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$.\nCase 3.5: There are exactly four subsets in $\\mathcal C$ that contain 2 elements.\nThey take the form $\\left\\{ a_1, a_2 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_3 \\right\\}$, $\\left\\{ a_1, a_4

a_1, a_5 \\right\\}$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions is 5.\nPutting all subcases together, the number of solutions is this case is $10 + 30 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 75$.\nCase 4: $N \\geq 3$.\nThe number of subsets of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right\\}$ that contain at least three elements is $\\sum_{i=3}^5 \\binom{5}{i} = 16$.\nBecause $\\mathcal C$ has 16 elements, we must select all such subsets into $\\mathcal C$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions in this case is 1.\nPutting all cases together, the total number of $\\mathcal C$ is $5 + 75 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(081) }}$.\nDenote the $A$ as $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \\}$ and the collection of subsets as $S$. \n\nCase 1: There are only sets of size $3$ or higher in $S$:  \nAny two sets in $S$ must have at least one element common to both of them (since $3+3>5$). Since there are $16$ subsets of $A$ that have size $3$ or higher, there is only one possibility for this case.\n\nCase 2: There are only sets of size $2$ or higher in $S$:  \nFirstly, there cannot be a no size $2$ set $S$, or it will be overcounting the first case.\nIf there is only one such size $2$ set, there are $10$ ways to choose it. That size $2$ set, say $X$, cannot be in $S$ with $Y = A/X$ (a three element set). Thus, there are only $15$ possible size $3$ subsets that can be in $S$, giving us $10$ for this case.\nIf there are two sets with size $2$ in $S$, we can choose the common elements of these two subsets in $5$ ways, giving us a total of $5\\cdot 6 = 30$.\nIf there are three sets with size $2$, they can either share one common element, which can be done in $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways, or they can share pairwise common elements (sort of like a cycle), which can be done $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways. In total, we have $30$ possibilities.\nIf there are four sets with size $2$, they all have to share one common element, which can be done in $5\\cdot 1$ ways.\nThus, summing everything up, this will give us $75$ possible sets $S$\n\nCase 3: There is a set with size $1$ in $S$:  \nNotice that be at most one size $1$ subset. There are $5$ ways to choose that single element set. Say it's $\\{ 1\\}$. All other subsets in $S$ must have a $1$ in them, but there are only $2^4-1 = 15$ of them. Thus this case yields $5\\cdot 1 = 5$ possibilities.\n\nThus, the total number of sets $S$ would be $1+75+5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(081)}}$.\n~sml1809\nFirstly, there cannot be two subsets with cardinality 1, or they will not intersect.\nIf there is one subset $A$ with cardinality $1$; let the element in $A$ be $a$, then there are $2^4=16$ subsets that do not include $a$ so they do not work. Every remaining subsets $S$ will have $a$ as an element so $S\\cap{A}\\geq1$, since we just excluded all that do not. Since there are 15 subsets left, all are forced into the group of 16 subsets, so we just choose the number of $a$ to determine the set $A$. $A\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ so there are 5 ways.\nFor the rest of the cases, we assume there are no sets $A$ with cardinality 1.  Notice that the only way to \"violate\" the condition is to have subsets $X$ and $Y$ with cardinalities 2 and 3 in some order. Otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, if two sets both have cardinalities more than 3, they are bound to have one element of intersection. Say a set $S$ has $|S|=2$, then there is clearly only one set $s$ that will make $S\\cap{s}=0$. By our previous claim, all other subsets that have cardinality $c\\geq{3}$ will work.\nNow if we generalize a bit: If a subset has $N$ 2-element subsets which belong to set $M$, then there are exactly $N$ subsets with cardinality 3 that don't work. Therefore, the number of \"violating subsets\" are all subsets with cardinality $c\\leq{1}$, all 2-element subsets that are not in $M$, and all corresponding cardinality 3 subsets. Subtracting from the total 32 subsets, we get that $32-(1+5+(10-N)+N)=16$ subsets that do work. This includes all subsets in $M$, so the remaining non-violating subsets are forced. This is equivalent now to choosing $N$ 2 element subsets.\nFollowing casework on the number of 2-element subsets:\nIf $N=1$: There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\nIf $N=2$: There are $5$ ways to choose the intersection between the 2 sets (remember they have to have at least one element of intersection) and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the distinct elements in the subsets, so there are $5*6=30$ ways.\nIf $N=3$: It can be a cycle, where WLOG let the elements be $a,b,c$ so the sets are $\\{a,b\\}$, $\\{b,c\\}$, and $\\{c,a\\}$. This is just $\\binom{5}{3}=10$. Alternatively, it can also be the case where all sets share one element. There are 5 ways to choose this element and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the remaining elements to assign to each set. There are $30$ ways.\nIf $N=4$: By the Pigeonhole Principle, the only way all pairwise sets have at one common intersection is if all share one element in common. There are 5 ways to choose this element and the remaining numbers are forced. There are 5 ways.\n$N\\geq{5}$ does not provide any valid cases since to have all pairwise elements to intersect one element, they must be the same element by the Pigeonhole Principle, but there are not enough subsets.\nIf $N=0$, then there is only one way since $\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}+\\binom{5}{5}=16$.\nAdding all cases yields $5+10+30+30+5+1=\\boxed{81}$ ways!\n-Magnetoninja",

We can use elementary calculus for this, but to do so, we must put the expression in terms of one variable. Recall that $a^2+b^2=16$; thus, $b=\\pm\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Notice that we have a $-108b$ in the expression; to maximize the expression, we want $b$ to be negative so that $-108b$ is positive and thus contributes more to the expression. We thus let $b=-\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Let $f(a)=81a-108b$. We now know that $f(a)=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2}$, and can proceed with normal calculus. \n\\begin{align*}\nf(a)&=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right) \\\\\nf'(a)&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)' \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)'\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\dfrac{-2a}{2\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-4\\left(\\dfrac a{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe want $f'(a)$ to be $0$ to find the maximum. \n\\begin{align*}\n0&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right) \\\\\n&=3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n3&=\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n4a&=3\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n16a^2&=9\\left(16-a^2\\right) \\\\\n16a^2&=144-9a^2 \\\\\n25a^2&=144 \\\\\na^2&=\\dfrac{144}{25} \\\\\na&=\\dfrac{12}5 \\\\\n&=2.4. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe also find that $b=-\\sqrt{16-2.4^2}=-\\sqrt{16-5.76}=-\\sqrt{10.24}=-3.2$. \nThus, the expression we wanted to maximize becomes $81\\cdot2.4-108(-3.2)=81\\cdot2.4+108\\cdot3.2=\\boxed{540}$. \n~Technodoggo\nSame steps as solution one until we get $\\text{Re}(w)=81a-108b$. We also know $|z|=4$ or $a^2+b^2=16$. We want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.\nUsing $\\frac{|ax+by+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=r$ we can substitute and get $\\frac{|81(0)-108(0)-k|}{\\sqrt{81^2+108^2}}=4$\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{18225}}&=4 \\\\\\frac{k}{135}&=4 \\\\k&=\\boxed{540} \\end{align*}\n~BH2019MV0\nFollow Solution 1 to get $81a-108b$. We can let $a=4\\cos\\theta$ and $b=4\\sin\\theta$ as $|z|=4$, and thus we have $324\\cos\\theta-432\\sin\\theta$. Furthermore, we can ignore the negative sign in front of the second term as we are dealing with sine and cosine, so we finally wish to maximize $324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$ for obviously positive $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$.\n\nUsing the previous fact, we can use the [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cauchy-Schwarz_Inequality) to calculate the maximum. By the inequality, we have:\n$(324^2+432^2)(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta)\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$540^2\\cdot1\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$\\boxed{540}\\ge324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$\n~eevee9406\nSimilar to the solutions above, we find that $Re((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z})=81a-108b=27(3a-4b)$, where $z=a+bi$. To maximize this expression, we must maximize $3a-4b$. Let this value be $x$. Solving for $a$ yields $a=\\frac{x+4b}{3}$. From the given information we also know that $a^2+b^2=16$. Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$. Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$. This is useful because we want the maximum value of $x$ such that this quadratic has real roots which is easy to find using the discriminant. For the roots to be real, $(8x)^2-4(25)(x^2-144) \\ge 0$. Now all that is left to do is to solve this inequality. Simplifying this expression, we get $-36x^2+14400 \\ge 0$ which means $x^2 \\le 400$ and $x \\le 20$. Therefore the maximum value of $x$ is $20$ and $27 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{540}$\n~vsinghminhas\nFirst, recognize the relationship between the reciprocal of a complex number $z$ with its conjugate $\\overline{z}$, namely:\n\\[\\frac{1}{z} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{\\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\]\nThen, let $z = 4(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$ and $\\overline{z} = 4(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)$.\n\\begin{align*} Re \\left ((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z} \\right) &= Re\\left ( (75+117i)z + (6+9i)\\overline{z}    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot Re\\left ( (75+117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + (6+9i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta + 6\\cos\\theta + 9\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot (3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) \\end{align*}\nNow, recognizing the 3 and 4 coefficients hinting at a 3-4-5 right triangle, we \"complete the triangle\" by rewriting our desired answer in terms of an angle of that triangle $\\phi$ where $\\cos\\phi = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\sin\\phi = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\\begin{align*} 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot(3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (\\frac{3}{5}\\cos\\theta - \\frac{4}{5}\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cdot (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\end{align*}\nSince the simple trig ratio is bounded above by 1, our answer is $\\boxed{540}$\n~ Cocoa @ [https://www.corgillogical.com/](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.corgillogical.com/)\n(yes i am a corgi that does math)\nFollow as solution 1 would to obtain $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2}.$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have\n\\[(a^2 + (\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2)(81^2 + 108^2) \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2,\\]\nso \n\\[4^2 \\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 15^2 \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2\\]\nand we obtain that $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\leq 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 15 = \\boxed{540}.$\n\n- [spectraldragon8](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Spectraldragon8)\nFollow solution 2 to get that we want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.

Similarly, suppose that Sherry travels a distance of $a$ in the $x$-direction but a distance of $b$ in the $y$-direction in one minute when there is no current. The current only affects the $x$-components because it goes in the $x$-direction. \n\nNow, note that $a^2 + b^2 = 60^2$ because Sherry travels 60 meters in a minute. Thus, $a^2 + c^2 = 80^2$ because Melanie travels 80 meters in a minute. Also, the distance they travel with the current must be the same in one minute because they reach the point equidistant from them at the same time. That means $b + 14 = c - 14$ or $b = c - 28$. So now we can plug that into the two equations to get:\n\\begin{align*} a^2 + c^2 &= 80^2, \\\\ a^2 + (c-28)^2 &= 60^2. \\end{align*}\nWe can solve the system of equations to get $a = 48$ and $c = 64$. From this, we can figure out that it must've taken them $5.5$ minutes to get to the other side, because $264/48 = 5.5$. This means that there are $5.5$ lengths of $48$ in each person's travel. Also, $D$ must be equal to $11(b+14) = 11(c-14)$ because there are $(5.5)2 = 11$ lengths of $b-14$ between them, $5.5$ on each person's side. Since $c = 64$, we have $c-14 = 50$, so the answer is \\[D=11\\cdot50=\\boxed{550}.\\]\n~Curious_crow",

    "solution": "Let's redraw the diagram, but extend some helpful lines.\n\nWe obviously see that we must use power of a point since they've given us lengths in a circle and there are intersection points. Let $T_1, T_2, T_3$ be our tangents from the circle to the parallelogram. By the secant power of a point, the power of $A = 3 \\cdot (3+9) = 36$. Then $AT_2  = AT_3 = \\sqrt{36} = 6$. Similarly, the power of $C = 16 \\cdot (16+9) = 400$ and  $CT_1 = \\sqrt{400} = 20$. We let $BT_3 = BT_1 = x$ and label the diagram accordingly.\nNotice that because $BC = AD, 20+x = 6+DT_2 \\implies DT_2 = 14+x$. Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Since $OT_1$ and $OT_2$ intersect $BC$ and $AD$, respectively, at right angles, we have $T_2T_1CD$ is a right-angled trapezoid and more importantly, the diameter of the circle is the height of the triangle. Therefore, we can drop an altitude from $D$ to $BC$ and $C$ to $AD$, and both are equal to $2r$. Since $T_1E = T_2D$, $20 - CE = 14+x \\implies CE = 6-x$. Since $CE = DF, DF = 6-x$ and $AF = 6+14+x+6-x = 26$. We can now use Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle ACF$; we have $26^2 + (2r)^2 = (3+9+16)^2 \\implies 4r^2 = 784-676 \\implies 4r^2 = 108 \\implies 2r = 6\\sqrt{3}$ and $r^2 = 27$.\nWe know that $CD = 6+x$ because $ABCD$ is a parallelogram. Using Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle CDF$, $(6+x)^2 = (6-x)^2 + 108 \\implies (6+x)^2-(6-x)^2 = 108 \\implies 12 \\cdot 2x = 108 \\implies 2x = 9 \\implies x = \\frac{9}{2}$. Therefore, base $BC = 20 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{49}{2}$.

Let points $M, N$ and $L$ be the tangent points of lines $BC, AD$ and $AB$ respectively to the circle. By Power of a Point, $({MC})^2=16\\cdot{25} \\Longrightarrow MC=20$. Similarly, $({AL})^2=3\\cdot{12} \\Longrightarrow AL=6$. Notice that $AL=AN=6$ since quadrilateral $LONA$ is symmetrical. Let $AC$ intersect $MN$ at $I$. Then, $\\bigtriangleup{IMC}$ is similar to $\\bigtriangleup{AIN}$. Therefore, $\\frac{CI}{MC}=\\frac{AI}{AN}$. Let the length of $PI=l$, then $\\frac{25-l}{20}=\\frac{3+l}{6}$. Solving we get $l=\\frac{45}{13}$.

Then, $\\bigtriangleup{ABR}$ is right with $AR=6-x$, $AB=6+x$, and $RB=2r_1=MN=6\\sqrt{3}$. Taking the difference of squares, we get $108=24x \\Longrightarrow x=\\frac{9}{2}$. The area of $ABCD$ is $MN\\cdot{BC}=(20+x)\\cdot{MN} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{49}{2}\\cdot{6\\sqrt{3}}=147\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the answer is $147+3=\\boxed{150}$\n~[Magnetoninja](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Magnetoninja)\nSay that $BC$ is tangent to the circle at $X$ and $AD$ tangent at $Y$. Also, $H$ is the intersection of $XY$ (diameter) and $AC$ (diagonal). Then by power of a point with given info on $A$ and $C$ we get that $AY=6$ and $CX=20$. Note that $HAY \\sim HCX$, and since $\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}$ we note that \\[\\frac{AH}{CH} = \\frac{AP+PH}{CQ+QH} = \\frac{3+PH}{16+QH} =\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}\\]. Since $PH+HQ=9$, we get that $PH=\\frac{45}{13}$ and $QH=\\frac{72}{13}$. This is the length information within the circle.\nThe same triangle similarity also means that $\\frac{YH}{XH}=\\frac{3}{10}$, so if the radius of the circle is $r$ then we have $XH=\\frac{20}{13}r$ and $YH = \\frac{6}{13}r$. \nBy power of a point on H, we can figure out $r$:\n\\[XH\\cdot YH = PH \\cdot QG\\]\n\\[\\frac{20}{13}r \\cdot \\frac{6}{13}r = \\frac{45}{13} \\cdot \\frac{72}{13}\\]\nand we get that $r = 3 \\sqrt 3$.

We call the three values of y that solve this equation: $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}$\nUsing Vieta's Formulas, you get these three expressions:\n\\[y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} = 0\\]\n\\[y_{1} * y_{2} * y_{3} = -240\\]\n\\[(y_{1} * y_{2}) + (y_{2} * y_{3}) + (y_{1} * y_{3}) = -76\\]\nIn addition, we know that $y \\vert 60$, because of our expression for x. \nSince the three values of y multiply to a negative number but also add to 0, we know that one value is negative and the other two are positive, and that the absolute value of the negative value is greater than both of the positive values.\nList of possible values for y are $\\{-60,-30,-20,-15,-12,-10,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\\}$\nFrom a list of these values, the only values that work are $y_1 = -10, y_2 = 6, y_3 = 4$ because\n\\[-10 + 6 + 4 = 0\\]\n\\[-10 * 6 * 4 = -240\\]\n\\[(-10 * 6) + (-10 * 4) + (6 * 4) = -60 - 40 + 24 = -76\\]\nPlugging in these values for y into our expression for x, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{-10} - 4 = -10\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{6} - 4 = 6\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{4} - 4 = 11\\]\nSo, now we have accounted for both cases, and we have 4 values of x = $\\{-10,4,6,11\\}$\nSquaring all these terms we get: 100 + 16 + 36 + 121 = 273, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(273)}}$\n~Cardtricks\nSince all three equations are in the form $\\frac{K}{a} + 4a = 60$ where $K = xyz$, we can rearrange this to see that $x$, $y$, and $z$ all satisfy \n\\[ 4a^2 - 60a + K = 0. \\]\nLet this quadratic have roots $a_1$ and $a_2$. Then, there are two cases to consider: two of $x$, $y$, $z$ are equal to $a_1$ and the third is equal to $a_2$, or all of $x$, $y$, $z$ are equal to $a_1$.\nCase 1: WLOG let $x = y = a_1$ and $z = a_2$.\nThen by Vieta's,\n\\[x + z = 15 \\hspace{1cm} (1)\\]\n\\[xz = \\frac{x^2z}{4} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\\]\nwhich gives $x = y = 4$ and $z = 11$. But we can swap $x$, $y$, and $z$ however we like, so this also gives $x = 11$ as a solution. In total, this case yields $x = 4$ and $x = 11$ as possible values of $x$.\nCase 2: WLOG let $x = y = z = a_1$.\nAgain, by Vieta's,\n\\[x + a_2 = 15 \\hspace{1cm} (1)\\]\n\\[xa_2 = \\frac{x^3}{4} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\\]\nWe can use $(2)$ to isolate $a_2$ in terms of $x$, then plug that into $(1)$ to get that $x^2 + 4x - 60 = 0$. This yields $x = -10$ and $x = 6$ as additional possible values of $x$.\nIn all, $x$ can be any of $\\{ 4, 11, -10, 6 \\}$, so the requested answer is $4^2 + 11^2 + (-10)^2 + 6^2 = \\boxed{273}.$\nWe index these equations as (1), (2), and (3) respectively (same as solution 2). There are two possible cases:\nCase 1: $x = \\pm 4$\nIn this case, we simply plug in $x = 4$ and $x = -4$. We note that $x=4$ is a valid case.\nCase 2: $x \\neq \\pm 4$\nIn this case, using equation (3), we get $y = 15 - \\frac{xz}{4}$. Plugging that into equation (1), we get $z = \\frac{240-60x}{16-x^2}$. Plugging that expression back into the original expression for $y$ we obtain $y = 15 - \\frac{60x-15x^2}{16-x^2}$. \nNow we plug these two expressions into equation (2):\n\\[\\left(15 - \\frac{60x-15x^2}{16-x^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{240-60x}{16-x^2}\\right) = 60-4x\\]\nmultiplying both sides by $(16-x^2)$ and factoring, we get:\n\\[\\left(15(4-x)(4+x)-60x+15x^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{60(4-x)}{(4+x)(4-x)}\\right) = 4(15 - x)(4 + x)(4 - x)\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[x^3 - 7x^2 - 104x + 660 = 0\\]\nwe note that $x = 6$ is a root. Factoring, we get the other roots, -10 and 11. \nOur desired answer is the sum of the square of all these roots: \\[4^2 + 6^2 + (-10)^2 + 11^2 = \\boxed{273}\\]\n~Chupdogs",

Since the other two values in the list must be distinct, and their sum must equal $30-18=12$, we have that the two numbers are in the form $a$ and $12-a$. Note that we cannot have both values greater than $9$, and we cannot have only one value greater than $9$, because this would make the median $9$, which violates condition 3.

Complete the cube to get $-(a-100)^3-(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 9000000-30000(a+b+c)$, which so happens to be 0. Then we have $(a-100)^3+(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 0$.

We assume $a + b + c = 300$, $ab + bc + ca = m$, and $abc = n$. Thus $a$, $b$, $c$ are the three roots of a cubic polynomial $f(x)$.\nWe note that $300m = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=\\sum_{cyc} a^2b + 3abc = 6000000 + 3n$, which simplifies to $100m - 2000000 = n$.\nOur polynomial $f(x)$ is therefore equal to $x^3 - 300x^2 + mx - (100m - 2000000)$. Note that $f(100) = 0$, and by polynomial division we obtain $f(x) = (x - 100)(x^2 - 200x - (m-20000))$.\nWe now notice that the solutions to the quadratic equation above are $x = 100 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{200^2 - 4(m - 20000)}}{2} = 100 \\pm \\sqrt{90000 - 4m}$, and that by changing the value of $m$ we can let the roots of the equation be any pair of two integers which sum to $200$. Thus any triple in the form $(100, 100 - x, 100 + x)$ where $x$ is an integer between $0$ and $100$ satisfies the conditions.\nNow to count the possible solutions, we note that when $x \\ne 100$, the three roots are distinct; thus there are $3! = 6$ ways to order the three roots. As we can choose $x$ from $0$ to $99$, there are $100 \\cdot 3! = 600$ triples in this case. When $x = 100$, all three roots are equal to $100$, and there is only one triple in this case.\nIn total, there are thus $\\boxed{601}$ distinct triples.\n~GaloisTorrent <3\nLet's define $a=100+x$, $b=100+y$, $c=100+z$.

    "problem": "Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.\n[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]",
    "solution": "By Furaken\nThere are two kinds of such rectangles: those whose sides are parallel to some edges of the regular 12-gon (Case 1, and those whose sides are not (Case 2).\nFor Case 1, WLOG assume that the rectangle's sides are horizontal and vertical (don't forget to multiply by 3 at the end of Case 1). Then the rectangle's sides coincide with these segments as shown in the diagram.\n\nWe use inclusion-exclusion for this. There are 30 valid rectangles contained in $A_1A_5A_7A_{11}$, as well as 30 in $A_2A_4A_8A_{10}$. However, the 9 rectangles contained in $B_1B_2B_3B_4$ have been counted twice, so we subtract 9 and we have 51 rectangles in the diagram. Multiplying by 3, we get 153 rectangles for Case 1.\nFor Case 2, we have this diagram. To be honest, you can count the rectangles here in whatever way you like.\n\nThere are 36 rectangles contained within $A_2A_5A_8A_{11}$, and 18 that use points outside $A_2A_5A_8A_{11}$. So we get a total of $3(36+18)=162$ rectangles for Case 2.\nAdding the two cases together, we get the answer $\\boxed{315}$.\nUsing the same diagram as Solution 1, we can get the number of rectangles from Case 1 by adding the number of rectangles of $A_2$ $A_8$ $A_8$ $A_{10}$ and $A_1$ $A_5$ $A_7$ $A_{11}$ and then subtracting the overlaps,\n\\[\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{5}{2}\\binom{3}{2} - \\binom{3}{2}\\binom{3}{2}\\]\n\\[=51\\]\nWe multiply this by 3 to get the total number of rectangles for Case 1, which is 153.\nFor Case 2, we can first get the total number of rectangles from \n$A_2A_3A_4A_5A_8A_9A_{10}A_{11}$ then add $A_1A_6A_7A_{12}$ and subtract by the overlaps,\n\\[\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{6}{2} - \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{6}{2} - \\binom{4}{2}\\]\n\\[= 54\\]\nMultiply that by 3 and add it to Case 1 to get $\\boxed{315}$.\n~pengf\nWe put the dodecagon in the right position that there exists a side whose slope is 0.\nNote that finding a rectangle is equivalent to finding two pairs of lines, such that two lines in each pair are parallel and lines from different pairs are perpendicular.\nNow, we use this property to count the number of rectangles.\nBecause two pairs of lines that form a rectangle are perpendicular, we only need to use the slope of one pair, denoted as $k$, to determine the direction of the rectangle.\nThe slope of the other pair is thus $- \\frac{1}{k}$. To avoid overcounting, we do casework analysis by defining each case in term of $0 \\leq k < \\infty$ only (we make a convention that if $k = 0$, then $- \\frac{1}{k} = \\infty$).\nIn our counting, we will frequently quantify the distance between two vertices of the regular dodecagon.\nTo characterize this in a straightforward way, we simply measure the number of vertices (on the minor arc) between our measured two vertices. For instance, two vertices on a side has distance 0. Distances between two vertices that are diagonals can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nCase 1: $k = 0, \\tan 30^\\circ, \\tan 60^\\circ$.\nWe only count for $k = 0$. The number of solutions for $k = \\tan 30^\\circ$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ$ are the same.\nConsider $k = 0$.\nWe need to find a pair of horizontal segments and a pair of vertical segments to form a rectangle.\nFor $k = 0$, the length of each horizontal segment can only be 0, 2, 4.\nDenote by $2i$ the shorter length of two parallel horizontal segments.\nGiven $i$, the number of pairs of two parallel horizontal segments is $1 + 2 \\left( 4 - 2 i \\right)$.\nGiven $i$, to form a rectangle, the number of pairs of vertical segments is $\\binom{2i + 2}{2}$.\nTherefore, for $k = 0$, the number of rectangles is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^2 \\left( 1 + 2 \\left( 4 - 2 i \\right) \\right)\n\\binom{2i + 2}{2}\n& = 54 .\n\\end{align*}\nThe number of rectangles for $k = \\tan 30^\\circ$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ$ are the same.\nTherefore, the total number of rectangles in this case is $54 \\cdot 3 = 162$.\n\nCase 2: $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$, $\\tan 45^\\circ$, $\\tan 75^\\circ$.\nThe number of rectangles under all these $k$s are the same.\nSo we only count for $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$.\nFor $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$, the length of each segment can only be 1, 3, 5.\nHowever, there is only one segment with length 5.\nSo this cannot be the shorter length of two parallel segments with slope $\\tan 15^\\circ$.\nDenote by $2i + 1$ the shorter length of two parallel segments with slope $\\tan 15^\\circ$.\nGiven $i$, the number of pairs of two parallel segments is $1 + 2 \\left( 3 - 2 i \\right)$.\nGiven $i$, to form a rectangle, the number of pairs of vertical segments is $\\binom{2i + 3}{2}$.\nTherefore, for $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$, the number of rectangles is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^1 \\left( 1 + 2 \\left( 3 - 2 i \\right) \\right)\n\\binom{2i + 3}{2}\n& = 51 .\n\\end{align*}\nThe number of rectangles for $k = \\tan 45^\\circ$ and $\\tan 75^\\circ$ are the same.\nTherefore, the total number of rectangles in this case is $51 \\cdot 3 = 153$.\n\nPutting all cases together, the total number of rectangles is $162 + 153 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(315) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",

    "problem": "Adults made up $\\frac5{12}$ of the crowd of people at a concert. After a bus carrying $50$ more people arrived, adults made up $\\frac{11}{25}$ of the people at the concert. Find the minimum number of adults who could have been at the concert after the bus arrived.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of people at the party before the bus arrives. We know that $x\\equiv 0\\pmod {12}$, as $\\frac{5}{12}$ of people at the party before the bus arrives are adults. Similarly, we know that $x + 50 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, as $\\frac{11}{25}$ of the people at the party are adults after the bus arrives. $x + 50 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$ can be reduced to $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, and since we are looking for the minimum amount of people, $x$ is $300$. That means there are $350$ people at the party after the bus arrives, and thus there are $350 \\cdot \\frac{11}{25} = \\boxed{154}$ adults at the party.\n~eamo\nSince at the beginning, adults make up $\\frac{5}{12}$ of the concert, the amount of people must be a multiple of 12.\nCall the amount of people in the beginning $x$.Then $x$ must be divisible by 12, in other words: $x$ must be a multiple of 12.\nSince after 50 more people arrived, adults make up $\\frac{11}{25}$ of the concert, $x+50$ is a multiple of 25. This means $x+50$ must be a multiple of 5.\nNotice that if a number is divisible by 5, it must end with a 0 or 5. Since 5 is impossible (obviously, since multiples of 12 end in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0,...), $x$ must end in 0.\nNotice that the multiples of 12 that end in 0 are: 60, 120, 180, etc.. By trying out, you can clearly see that $x=300$ is the minimum number of people at the concert.\nSo therefore, after 50 more people arrive, there are $300+50=350$ people at the concert, and the number of adults is $350*\\frac{11}{25}=154$. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{154}$. \nI know this solution is kind of lame, but this is still pretty straightforward. This solution is very similar to the first one, though.\n~hastapasta\nLet $a$ be the number of adults before the bus arrived and $x$ be the total number of people at the concert. So, $\\frac{a}{x}=\\frac{5}{12}$. Solving for $x$ in terms of $a$, $x = \\frac{12}{5}a$. After the bus arrives, let's say there are an additional $y$ adults out of the 50 more people who enter the concert. From that, we get $\\frac{a+y}{x+50}=\\frac{11}{25}$. Replacing $x$ with the value of $a$, the second equation becomes $\\frac{a+y}{\\frac{12}{5}a+50}=\\frac{11}{25}$.\nBy cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get that $25(y-22)=\\frac{7a}{5}$.\nObserve that we must make sure $y-22$ is positive and divisible by $7$ to have an integer value of $a$. The smallest possible value of $y$ that satisfies this conditions is $29$. Plugging this into the equation, $a = 125$. The question asks for the minimum number of adults that are there after the bus arrives, which is $a+y$. Thus, the answer is simply $125+29=\\boxed{154}$.\n~mathical8",

Thus the distance between bases $A’B’$ and $CD$ is $12$ (in fact, $\\triangle A'B'D$ is a $9-12-15$ triangle with a $7-12-\\sqrt{193}$ triangle removed), which implies the area of $A'B'CD$ is $\\tfrac12\\cdot 12\\cdot(2+16) = 108$.\nNow let $O_1C = O_2A' = r_1$ and $O_2D = O_1B' = r_2$; the tangency of circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ implies $r_1 +  r_2 = 15$. Furthermore, angles $A'O_2D$ and $A'B'D$ are opposite angles in cyclic quadrilateral $B'A'O_2D$, which implies the measure of angle $A'O_2D$ is $180^\\circ - \\alpha$. Therefore, the Law of Cosines applied to triangle $\\triangle A'O_2D$ yields\n\\begin{align*} 193 &= r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2(-\\tfrac 35) = (r_1^2 + 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2) - \\tfrac45r_1r_2\\\\ &= (r_1+r_2)^2 - \\tfrac45 r_1r_2 = 225 - \\tfrac45r_1r_2. \\end{align*}\nThus $r_1r_2 = 40$, and so the area of triangle $A'O_2D$ is $\\tfrac12r_1r_2\\sin\\alpha = 16$.\nThus, the area of hexagon $ABO_{1}CDO_{2}$ is $108 + 2\\cdot 16 = \\boxed{140}$.\n~djmathman\nDenote by $O$ the center of $\\Omega$.\nDenote by $r$ the radius of $\\Omega$.\nWe have $O_1$, $O_2$, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are all on circle $\\Omega$.\nDenote $\\angle O_1 O O_2 = 2 \\theta$.\nDenote $\\angle O_1 O B = \\alpha$.\nDenote $\\angle O_2 O A = \\beta$.\nBecause $B$ and $C$ are on circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\Omega$, $BC$ is a perpendicular bisector of $O_1 O$.

Since for any real number $x$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x \\le \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1$, we have $U \\le U' \\le U + 2023$. Now, since $-1000 \\le U \\le 1000$, we have $-1000 \\le U' \\le 3023$.\nNow, we can solve for $U'$ in terms of $a$. We have:\n\\begin{align*} U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2-na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2}{5} - \\frac{na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2}{5}} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {{n^2}} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {na}}{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{2023(2023+1)(2023 \\cdot 2 + 1)}{6} - \\frac{a \\cdot 2023(2023+1)}{2} }{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30} \\\\ \\end{align*}\nSo, we have $U' = \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30}$, and $-1000 \\le U' \\le 3023$, so we have $-1000 \\le \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30} \\le 3023$, or $-30000 \\le 2023(2024)(4047-3a) \\le 90690$. Now, $2023 \\cdot 2024$ is much bigger than $90690$ or $30000$, and since $4047-3a$ is an integer, to satsify the inequalities, we must have $4047 - 3a = 0$, or $a = 1349$, and $U' = 0$.\nNow, we can find $U - U'$. We have:\n\\begin{align*} U - U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\end{align*}.\nNow, if $n^2-1349n \\equiv 0 \\text{ (mod 5)}$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} = 0$, and if $n^2-1349n \\equiv 1 \\text{ (mod 5)}$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5}$, and so on. Testing with $n \\equiv 0,1,2,3,4, \\text{ (mod 5)}$, we get $n^2-1349n \\equiv 0,2,1,2,0 \\text{ (mod 5)}$ respectively. From 1 to 2023, there are 405 numbers congruent to 1 mod 5, 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, 405 numbers congruent to 3 mod 5, 404 numbers congruent to 4 mod 5, and 404 numbers congruent to 0 mod 5. So, solving for $U - U'$, we get:\n\\begin{align*} U - U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\\\ &= 404 \\cdot 0 - 405 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} - 405 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} - 405 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} - 404 \\cdot t0 \\\\ &= -405(\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{5}) \\\\ &= -405 \\end{align*}\nSince $U' = 0$, this gives $U = -405$, and we have $a + U = 1349-405 = \\boxed{944}$.\n~ genius_007\nWe can view the floor function in this problem as simply subtracting the remainder of $n^2 - na$ (mod $5$) from the numerator of  \n$\\frac{n^2-na}{5}$. For example, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{7}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{7-2}{5} = 1$.\nNote that the congruence of  $n^2 - na$ (mod $5$) loops every time $n$ increases by 5. Also, note that the congruence of $a$ (mod $5$) determines the set of congruences of $n^2 - na$ for each congruence of $n$ (mod $5$). \nFor example, if $a \\equiv 1$ (mod $5$), the set of remainders is $(0, 2, 1, 2, 0)$ for $n \\equiv 1,2,3,4,0$ (mod $5$). Let the sum of these elements be $s$. Note that for each “loop” of the numerator (mod $5$), each element of the set will be subtracted exactly once, meaning $s$ is subtracted once for each loop. The value of the numerator will loop $404$ times (mod $5$) throughout the sum, as $5 \\cdot 404=2020$. Then \n$U \\approx \\frac {\\left( \\frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \\frac{(a)(n)(n+1)}{2}  -404s \\right)}{5}$\nWhere $n=2023$. Note that since $5 \\cdot 404=2020$, this is an approximation for $U$ because the equation disregards the remainder (mod $5$) when $n=2021, 2022$, and $2023$ so we must subtract the first 3 terms of our set of congruences one extra time to get the exact value of $U$ (*). However, we will find that this is a negligible error when it comes to the inequality $-1000<U<1000$, so we can proceed with this approximation to solve for $a$. \nFactoring our approximation gives $U \\approx \\frac {\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}-404s}{5}$\n\nWe set $a= \\frac{(2n+1)}{3} = 1349$ to make $\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}=0$, accordingly minimizing $|U|$, yielding  $U \\approx  \\frac{-404s}{5}$\nIf $a$ increases or decreases by $1$, then $U$ changes by $\\frac {(n)(n+1)}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac {2023 \\cdot 2024}{10}$\nwhich clearly breaks the inequality on $U$. Therefore $a=1349 \\equiv 4$ (mod $5$) giving the set of remainders $(2,1,2,0,0)$, so $s=5$ and our approximation yields $U \\approx -404$. However, we must subtract 2, 1, and 2 (*) giving us $U = - 404 - \\frac{(2+1+2)}{5} = - 405$, giving an answer of $1349-405= \\boxed{944}$\n~Spencer Danese\nConsider the integral\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2023} \\dfrac{n^2-na}{5} \\, dn.\\]\nWe hope this will give a good enough appoximation of $U$ to find $a.$ However, this integral can be easily evaluated(if you know calculus) to be\n\\[\\dfrac{1}{15}2023^3-\\dfrac{a}{10}2023^2=2023^2\\left(\\dfrac{2023}{15}-\\dfrac{a}{10}\\right).\\]\nBecause we want this to be as close to $0$ as possible, we find that $a$ should equal $1349.$ Then, evaluating the sum becomes trivial. Set\n\\[U'=\\sum_{n=1}^{2023}\\dfrac{n^2-1349n}{5}\\]\nand\n\\[U''=\\sum_{n=1}^{2023}\\{\\dfrac{n^2-1349n}{5}\\}.\\]\nThen $U=U'-U''.$ We can evaluate $U'$ to be $0$ and $U''$ to be $-405$ (using some basic number theory). Thus, $U=-405$ and the answer is\n\\[1349+(-405)=\\boxed{944}.\\]\n~[BS2012](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/BS2012)",

Therefore, a trial-and-error method can be set up, wherein line segments of length $n\\cdot 10$, scaled to the same scale as the triangle, can be drawn to represent the sides of the hexagon. For instance, side $BC$ would be drawn parallel to the side of the triangle of length 300, and would have endpoints on the other sides of the triangle.

    "solution": "The problem says \"some\", so not all cells must be occupied.\nWe start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5,4,3,2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black- $1$ way . There are $5$ ways to select 4 cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4-1$ different ways($-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for 3,2 or 1 black chips on the left there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with 2 black chips on the left, there will be 3 blank rows. There are 15 ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following 2 rows must have the same order. Thus, The number of ways for 3,2,and 1 black chips is $10*15$, $10*15$, $5*15$. Adding these up, we have $1+75+150+150+75 = 451$. Multiplying this by 2, we get $\\boxed{902}$.\n~westwoodmonster\nNote that the answer is equivalent to the number of ways to choose rows and columns that the white chips occupy, as once those are chosen, there is only one way to place the chips, and every way to place the chips corresponds to a set of rows and columns occupied by the white pieces.\nIf the white pieces occupy none of the rows, then because they don't appear on the board, they will not occupy any of the columns. Similar logic can be applied to show that if white pieces occupy all of the rows, they will also occupy all of the columns.\nThe number of sets of rows and columns that white can occupy are $2^{5} - 2 = 30$ each, accounting for the empty and full set.\nSo, including the board with 25 white pieces and the board with 25 black pieces, the answer is $30^{2}+2 = \\boxed{902}$\nCase 1: All chips on the grid have the same color.\nIn this case, all cells are occupied with chips with the same color.\nTherefore, the number of configurations in this case is 2.\nCase 2: Both black and white chips are on the grid.\nObservation 1: Each colored chips must occupy at least one column and one row.\nThis is because, for each given color, there must be at least one chip. Therefore, all chips placed in the cells that are in the same row or the same column with this given chip must have the same color with this chip.\nObservation 2: Each colored chips occupy at most 4 rows and 4 columns.\nThis directly follows from Observation 1.\nObservation 3: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by a chip with the same color.\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\nIf there is any cell in this region that is empty, then it violates Condition 3.\nObservation 4: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$, or $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is empty.\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\nObservation 5: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by chips with the different color.\nThis follows from Condition 3.\nBy using the above observations, the number of feasible configurations in this case is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=1}^4 \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\binom{5}{m}\n& = \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\right)\n\\left( \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{m} \\right) \\\\\n& = \\left( 2^5 - 2 \\right)^2 \\\\\n& = 900 .\n\\end{align*}\nPutting all cases together, the total number of feasible configurations is $2 + 900 =  \\boxed{\\textbf{(902) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",

The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",
    "solution": "Observe that the \"worst\" possible box is one of the maximum possible length. \nBy symmetry, the height and the width are the same in this antioptimal box. (If the height and width weren't the same, the extra difference between them could be used to make the length longer.) Thus, let the width and height be of length $a$ and the length be $L$. \nWe're given that the volume is $23$; thus, $a^2L=23$. We're also given that the surface area is $54=2\\cdot27$; thus, $a^2+2aL=27$. \nFrom the first equation, we can get $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$. We do a bunch of algebra: \n\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\dfrac{23}{a^2} \\\\\n27&=a^2+2aL \\\\\n&=a^2+2a\\left(\\dfrac{23}{a^2}\\right) \\\\\n&=a^2+\\dfrac{46}a \\\\\n27a&=a^3+46 \\\\\na^3-27a+46&=0. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem and test a few values. It turns out that $a=2$ works. We use synthetic division to divide by $a-2$: \n[Asdf.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Asdf.png)\nAs we expect, the remainder is $0$, and we are left with the polynomial $x^2+2x-23$. We can now simply use the quadratic formula and find that the remaining roots are $\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4(-23)}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{96}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm4\\sqrt{6}}2=-1\\pm2\\sqrt6$. We want the smallest $a$ to maximize $L$, and it turns out that $a=2$ is in fact the smallest root. Thus, we let $a=2$. Substituting this into $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$, we find that $L=\\dfrac{23}4$. However, this is not our answer! This is simply the length of the box; we want the radius of the sphere enclosing it. We know that the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box, and the 3D Pythagorean Theorem can give us the space diagonal. Applying it, we find that the diagonal has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2+\\left(\\dfrac{23}4\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{8+\\dfrac{529}{16}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{128+529}{16}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}4$. This is the diameter; we halve it to find the radius, $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}8$.
