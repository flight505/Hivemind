Below is a structured, investment‑oriented readout of Bitcoin’s on‑chain supply dynamics and holder behavior from Feb 15, 2025 to Aug 15, 2025, with an emphasis on what this implies for latent sell pressure vs. absorption capacity.

Executive summary
- Net supply tightness increased through the period: long‑term holders (LTHs) continued to reclaim/retain supply and smaller “shrimp/crab/fish” cohorts accumulated at a pace above new issuance, while exchange balances fell to cycle lows. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cryptotimes.io](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/06/02/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-all-time-low-below-2-6m-btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [coinedition.com](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-multi-year-low-supply-shock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Miners faced a persistently low fee environment (low hashprice support), but new issuance (~13.4k BTC/month post‑halving) was more than offset by spot accumulation from smaller cohorts and ETF custody growth; some large miners deployed treasuries to credit/yield rather than spot sell. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [hashrateindex.com](https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-may-26-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [theminermag.com](https://theminermag.com/news/2025-07-31/miner-weekly-mara-bitcoin-yield/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Profit‑taking flipped between cohorts as price cycled: early‑period STHs realized large losses; by May–June, STH profit‑taking surged on rebounds; LTH profit‑taking rose near highs but was outweighed by maturation into the LTH cohort—an atypically “sticky” late‑bull pattern. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-12-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Net read‑through: Sell‑side supply remained constrained (low issuance, falling exchange reserves, rising LTH share), with absorption supported by ETF/retail accumulation. Key risk remains STH stress if price trades below their aggregate cost basis, which can quickly flip SOPR‑like profitability back <1 and trigger distribution. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

1) Miner issuance, revenues and treasuries (hashprice, fee share, hedging/treasury use)
- Issuance and cohort absorption
  - Post‑halving issuance averaged ~13.4k BTC/month. Retail cohorts—Shrimp (<1 BTC), Crabs (1–10), Fish (10–100)—accumulated at ~+19.3k BTC/month in early July, outpacing issuance and mechanically tightening free float. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Fee share and hashprice
  - Fees remained structurally weak over most of H1’25, depressing hashprice. In March, fees per block fell to ~0.039 BTC—the lowest since 2012. In late May (May 19–26), miner fees were ~1.4% of block rewards; USD hashprice hovered around $55–57 per PH/s/day that week—hardly a windfall. Low/volatile fee share limited revenue‑driven miner distribution. ([hashrateindex.com](https://hashrateindex.com/blog/luxor-hashrate-lookback-series-march-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Miner treasuries and “hedging” via treasury deployment
  - Public miners continued to hold sizeable BTC treasuries and increasingly “put them to work.” Example: Marathon held ~49,951 BTC as of Jun 30, 2025, with ~31% actively deployed across lending/asset management/collateralized credit lines—raising liquidity without immediate spot sales and enabling balance‑sheet‑based risk management. This acts as a de‑facto hedge against revenue volatility by monetizing inventory and accessing credit rather than selling. ([theminermag.com](https://theminermag.com/news/2025-07-31/miner-weekly-mara-bitcoin-yield/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Investment implication: With issuance structurally low and retail/ETF absorption outpacing new supply, miner‑led sell pressure was not the dominant supply driver. Weak fee share constrained miner cash flow, but treasury deployment/credit reduced the need for spot distribution at the margin.

2) Exchange reserve dynamics (effective float available to sell)
- All‑exchange BTC reserves fell to multi‑year/record lows into June–July:
  - Late May: reserves slipped below ~2.6M BTC (CryptoQuant series). Mid‑July: ~2.4M BTC, down ~360k BTC YTD. These are consistent with coins moving to self‑custody and institutional/ETF custodians, curbing readily sellable supply on CEX. ([cryptotimes.io](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/06/02/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-all-time-low-below-2-6m-btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [coinedition.com](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-multi-year-low-supply-shock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- ETF context: By early July, spot ETF AUM reached ~$137B (IBIT ~55% share), reinforcing the narrative that a growing slice of supply sits in long‑horizon custody rather than exchange hot wallets. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Investment implication: Declining exchange reserves reduce immediate “at‑the‑market” sell liquidity, increasing the likelihood that marginal demand pushes price, but also making order books thinner during drawdowns (volatility amplifier).

3) Cohort composition: LTH vs. STH, net position change and UTXO aging
- Early period (mid‑Feb to late‑Mar): STH stress and loss realization
  - During drawdowns, STHs realized the bulk of losses. By Week 12 (mid‑March), STH supply in loss swelled to ~3.4M BTC; >90% of STH coins were underwater, and STHs held ~40% of network wealth (down from a ~50% local peak). Age‑band cost bases showed most STHs beyond 1 month were underwater—high latent sell pressure if weakness persisted. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-06-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Rebound phase (May–June): STH profit‑taking and LTH profit‑taking rise
  - As price reclaimed and then exceeded STH cost basis (~$93–98k region), STH realized profit surged, peaking near ~$747M/day (Week 20, May). LTH profit‑taking also increased as price neared/poked ATHs; LTH daily realized profits reached ~+$930M/day in June (Week 23). ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-20-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Late period (early July): LTH supply still climbs; small cohorts accumulate faster than issuance
  - Despite higher LTH spending, maturation/accumulation into the LTH cohort more than offset outflows—LTH wealth share continued to rise, which is atypical this late in a bull cycle. Simultaneously, shrimps/crabs/fish accumulated ~+19.3k BTC/month vs. ~+13.4k BTC/month issuance. Net: effective float tightened. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

UTXO age bands (HODL waves) signal
- The age‑distribution of spending showed the pressure concentrated in the youngest bands early on (24h–1m), transitioning to profit‑taking by STHs as price recovered; meanwhile, the stock of older UTXOs (LTH supply) kept creeping up—classic maturation. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-06-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4) Profitability metrics: SOPR/realized cap (read‑through via realized P/L)
- While we do not cite a specific aSOPR print, Glassnode’s realized profit/loss flow shows regimes consistent with SOPR > 1 during May–June (profit‑taking dominance), flipping toward neutrality when volatility rose and flows compressed. LTH realized profit spiked near highs, but maturation outpaced selling—consistent with rising realized cap and persistent cost‑basis accretion through Q2’s 31% BTC price gain. Inference: realized cap likely made incremental ATHs alongside spot in late Q2.

What this says about latent sell pressure vs. absorption capacity
- Latent sell pressure (supply ready/willing to hit the market)
  - Miners: Low issuance (~450 BTC/day) and low fees limited revenue‑driven selling; treasury deployment/credit reduced forced sales—moderate latent pressure. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [hashrateindex.com](https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-may-26-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [theminermag.com](https://theminermag.com/news/2025-07-31/miner-weekly-mara-bitcoin-yield/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
  - STHs: Elevated and fickle—STH behavior flipped from heavy loss realization (Feb–Mar) to heavy profit‑taking (May–Jun). The key trigger is price relative to STH cost basis (~$97.6k support cited in June). Sustained trading below this band re‑ignites STH capitulation risk. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
  - LTHs: Structural supply sink—despite notable profit‑taking into strength, LTH supply/wealth share kept rising as coins aged into the cohort, muting their net distribution—low latent pressure on net. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
  - Exchanges: Reserves near multi‑year lows (~2.4–2.6M BTC by Jun–Jul) imply fewer coins are immediately sellable on CEX—lower mechanical sell pressure but thinner order books. ([cryptotimes.io](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/06/02/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-all-time-low-below-2-6m-btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [coinedition.com](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-multi-year-low-supply-shock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Absorption capacity (demand that can absorb sell‑side)
  - Retail cohorts: Shrimp/Crab/Fish absorption (~+19.3k BTC/month) outpaced issuance—ongoing structural bid. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
  - ETFs/institutional custody: AUM near ATH by July (~$137B) indicates persistent allocator demand and coins moving to cold storage, weakening float on exchanges. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Bottom line for investors (Feb 15 → Aug 15, 2025)
- Balance of evidence favors constrained float and decent absorption: low issuance, low exchange reserves, rising LTH share, and small‑cohort accumulation outweigh miner and STH distribution.
- What would tip the balance bearish:
  - A sustained break below STH cost basis (~$97–100k area cited in June) that drives SOPR‑like metrics <1 and triggers STH capitulation.
  - A fee slump plus rising difficulty that forces miner deleveraging and treasury sales (watch fee share and credit conditions).
  - Material ETF outflows reversing the custody drain from exchanges. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- What would reinforce the bull case:
  - Continued ETF/stable allocator inflows.
  - Ongoing rise in LTH supply/illiquid supply with exchange reserves making fresh lows.
  - Fee tailwinds (organic demand for blockspace) lifting miner revenues without necessitating spot selling.

Simple “effective float” framing
```text
Effective Float (EF) ≈ Circulating Supply
                      – Long-term Holder Supply (aged + illiquid)
                      – Custodied-for-holdings (e.g., ETF cold storage)
                      – Lost/immobile supply
Direction of travel (Feb–Aug ’25): EF ↓ (tightening) as LTH↑, ETF custody↑, CEX reserves↓.
```

Assumptions, uncertainties, limitations
- Asset coverage: This analysis assumes the asset is Bitcoin (hashprice/UTXO/SOPR are Bitcoin‑specific metrics).
- Data windows: Glassnode Week‑On‑Chain reports cited span Weeks 6, 12, 20, 23, and 27 of 2025, covering Feb–early Jul. Conditions between early Aug and Aug 15, 2025 are assumed broadly continuous; any sharp, very recent shifts may not be fully reflected. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Exchange reserves: Primary CryptoQuant time series require login; cited figures are from reputable secondary outlets referencing CryptoQuant. Treat exact reserve levels (~2.4–2.6M BTC) as point estimates rather than audited totals. ([cryptotimes.io](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/06/02/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-all-time-low-below-2-6m-btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [coinedition.com](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-multi-year-low-supply-shock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- SOPR/realized cap specifics: We infer SOPR regime from realized P/L dominance and cost‑basis behavior in Glassnode reports and the general Q2 context, not from a single SOPR print; realized cap likely rose with price but we avoid quoting a precise figure without a primary chart. ([insights.glassnode.com](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [coinmetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io/state-of-the-network/q2-2025-wrap-up/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Miner “hedging”: Evidence shown here is treasury deployment for liquidity/yield and credit usage by public miners (e.g., MARA). Direct hashrate‑derivative hedging data for this exact window is limited in the public domain; treat this as illustrative of financial risk‑management rather than exhaustive coverage.
