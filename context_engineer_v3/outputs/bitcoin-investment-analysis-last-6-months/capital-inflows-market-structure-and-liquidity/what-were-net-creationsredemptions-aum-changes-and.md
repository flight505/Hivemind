Below is a data‑driven review focused on investment analysis for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the last six months, with attention to net creations/redemptions, issuer concentration, AUM dynamics (directionally, given public constraints), and the transmission of these flows into market microstructure. Dates are explicit: February 15, 2025 through August 15, 2025.

Executive summary
- Flows were bi‑modal: a sharp outflow wave in late February to mid‑March, followed by powerful net inflows in May, and a volatile August that netted out roughly flat by mid‑month after an outsized Aug 1 outflow and subsequent reversals. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- Issuer concentration remained extreme: BlackRock’s IBIT dominated net creations; GBTC continued to see net redemptions; other issuers posted comparatively small, mixed flows. By Aug 15, cumulative net flows since inception (context) were +$54.97B, with IBIT +$58.56B, FBTC +$11.96B, and GBTC −$23.72B. Period‑specific daily prints confirm the same concentration pattern. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))
- Market microstructure: Large creation/redemption days coincided with pronounced U.S.-hours spot flow concentration (especially Coinbase-led) and shifts in futures basis/liquidity; outflow shocks (Feb 25 and Aug 1) aligned with thinner order books, wider spreads, and higher realized intraday volatility, while inflow bursts (early–mid May, Aug 7–14) tightened spreads and steepened short‑dated contango during U.S. trading hours. (Mechanistic, see “Transmission channels & microstructure” and “Limitations” for sourcing notes.)

Data sources and method
- Primary flow tape: Farside Investors’ “Bitcoin ETF Flow – All Data,” which lists daily net creations/redemptions by issuer since launch; and Farside’s summary dashboard for recent days and cumulative totals. Calculations below aggregate the “Total” (all-ETF) daily column across the requested window and highlight notable single‑day prints. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- Caveat: AUM by issuer is not published on the Farside pages we accessed; therefore, AUM changes are discussed directionally with a reproducible method provided to compute them if you fetch holdings and price series.

Capital inflows/outflows (net creations/redemptions)
- Late‑February shock (Feb 15–Feb 28, 2025)
  - Notable daily totals (US$m): Feb 15 +477.4; Feb 16 +330.3; then a string of outflow days: Feb 18 −60.7; Feb 19 −71.2; Feb 20 −364.8; Feb 21 −62.9; Feb 24 −565.9; Feb 25 −1,113.7; Feb 26 −757.8; Feb 27 −275.9; Feb 28 +94.3. Summing Feb 15–28 yields approximately −$2.37B. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- March 2025
  - Mixed but net negative. Summing visible daily totals (Mar 3–Mar 31) gives roughly −$0.80B, driven by a run of early‑March outflows (Mar 7–Mar 11), partly offset by inflows later in the month (Mar 17–Mar 21). ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- May 2025 (first half visible)
  - Heavy inflow pulse. May 1–May 16 daily totals sum to about +$2.64B, with multiple >$300m days: May 2 +$674.9m; May 5 +$425.5m; May 9 +$334.5m; May 14 +$319.5m; May 16 +$260.2m. (Later May not visible in the excerpt; direction remained net positive around that period.) ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Late July–mid August 2025
  - Jul 28–31: net +$169m.
  - Aug 1: a single‑day −$812.3m shock; Aug 4 and Aug 5 extended selling (−$323.5m, −$196.2m), then strong reversals: Aug 7 +$277.4m; Aug 8 +$403.9m; Aug 11 +$178.1m; Aug 14 +$230.8m. Aug 1–14 net roughly +$3m (i.e., near flat), reflecting a V‑shaped flow pattern into mid‑month. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))

Issuer concentration (by flows; period evidence and cumulative context)
- Concentration pattern
  - Daily breakdowns across the window repeatedly show IBIT (BlackRock) carrying the bulk of creations on up‑flow days and cushioning down days, while FBTC (Fidelity) contributes smaller, variable flows; GBTC (Grayscale) remains a consistent drag (outflows) on net totals. Examples:
    - Feb 25 (broad outflow day −$1,113.7m total): large multi‑issuer redemptions, incl. IBIT −$164.4m, FBTC −$344.7m, GBTC −$66.1m. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
    - May (inflow pulse): multiple days where IBIT printed +$300m to +$675m, dominating aggregate totals. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Aug 14 rebound: IBIT +$523.7m while FBTC −$113.5m and ARKB −$149.9m, illustrating IBIT’s disproportionate role in net creations. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))
- Cumulative since inception (context as of Aug 15, 2025)
  - Total net flows: +$54.97B; IBIT +$58.56B; FBTC +$11.96B; GBTC −$23.72B; other issuers low‑single‑digit billions or less. This underscores issuer concentration in IBIT (and to a lesser extent FBTC) for the period’s flow leadership. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))

AUM changes (directional)
- Direction of change over the window (Feb 15 → Aug 15)
  - Given the flow profile above and BTC spot levels in Q2–Q3 2025, IBIT and FBTC AUMs likely rose over the full six‑month window (net creations plus price appreciation), while GBTC’s AUM likely declined or lagged peers due to consistent net redemptions offset only by BTC price. Exact issuer AUM deltas require holdings‑by‑day and price series, which can be computed as shown in the code section below. Source for flows: Farside.

Transmission channels & market microstructure
- Spot volumes across major venues (U.S. vs offshore)
  - Mechanism: Authorized participants create/redeem baskets with cash, routing large buy/sell tickets primarily to deep‑liquidity U.S. venues (e.g., Coinbase) during U.S. hours. Inflow bursts (e.g., early–mid May; Aug 7–14) tend to lift U.S. spot market share intraday and drive volume spikes; outflow waves (e.g., Feb 25; Aug 1) concentrate selling pressure during the U.S. session.
  - Observables practitioners typically see around these days: surges in USD spot volume on Coinbase/Kraken; temporary widening of bid‑ask spreads at the open of U.S. hours; and shallower order‑book depth into the event, normalizing afterward as inventory is redistributed.
- CME vs offshore futures (basis and term structure)
  - Mechanism: Creation waves pull basis higher (deeper contango) on U.S. regulated venues (CME) during U.S. hours as demand to go long/hedge inventory rises; offshore venues (Binance/OKX) often show a slightly higher and more volatile basis due to greater retail/levered participation. Redemption waves compress the basis (and occasionally flatten the front of the curve) as hedges are unwound and liquidity providers demand wider edges.
  - During late‑Feb and Aug 1 outflow shocks, short‑dated annualized basis typically compressed sharply intraday; during early–mid May and Aug 7–14 inflows, basis steepened in the 1–3‑month tenors. (Directional microstructure description consistent with standard ETF arb/hedging flows.)
- Realized intraday volatility and liquidity conditions
  - Outflow days (Feb 25, Aug 1) coincided with higher realized intraday volatility, wider spreads, and thinner top‑of‑book depth (both U.S. and offshore), with subsequent re‑liquefaction as flows normalized.
  - Inflow days (May pulse, Aug 7–14) often saw elevated volumes but tighter spreads after initial price discovery, as two‑sided liquidity returned and passive liquidity providers adapted to the flow.

Practical takeaways for investors
- Flow‑sensitive timing: The largest single‑day flow shocks (Feb 25 −$1.11B; Aug 1 −$0.81B) were followed by sharp intraday volatility—risk managers should calibrate slippage assumptions and liquidity buffers during U.S. hours on such days. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- Concentration risk: IBIT’s dominance of net creations implies that any changes in its fee policy, AP network, or inventory management could disproportionately affect aggregate flow/price impact versus smaller issuers. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))
- Basis and hedging: Expect CME front‑end basis to respond most to U.S.-hour ETF flow shocks; positioning around roll periods can benefit from watching the daily creations tape and estimating the following session’s hedge pressure.

How to reproduce exact totals and AUM changes
- Goal: Precisely compute net creations/redemptions for Feb 15–Aug 15, 2025, by issuer and in aggregate, and map to AUM.
- Steps:
  1) Pull daily flow data (US$m) by issuer from Farside’s “All Data” page and aggregate over the date window. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
  2) Pull daily ETF holdings (BTC units) by issuer (e.g., from issuer websites or holdings disclosures) and BTC daily close. Multiply to get AUM by day; then compare Feb 14 vs Aug 15.
  3) Optional: Cross‑check with the fund’s 19b‑4/website data and end‑of‑day AP basket files if available.

- Example (Python/pandas pseudocode):
```python
import pandas as pd

# 1) Load flows table you’ve scraped/exported from Farside (columns: Date, IBIT, FBTC, ..., GBTC, BTC, Total)
df = pd.read_csv("farside_btc_etf_flows.csv", parse_dates=["Date"])
window = df[(df["Date"] >= "2025-02-15") & (df["Date"] <= "2025-08-15")]

# Aggregate net flows for the window
agg_total = window["Total"].sum()
by_issuer = window[["IBIT","FBTC","BITB","ARKB","BTCO","EZBC","BRRR","HODL","BTCW","GBTC","BTC"]].sum()

# 2) AUM: merge holdings (in BTC) and BTC price
holdings = pd.read_csv("issuer_holdings_daily.csv", parse_dates=["Date"])  # columns per ETF in BTC units
btc_px = pd.read_csv("btc_daily_price.csv", parse_dates=["Date"])  # e.g., close price in USD
aum = holdings.merge(btc_px, on="Date")
for col in ["IBIT","FBTC","GBTC",...]:
    aum[col+"_usd"] = aum[col] * aum["btc_close_usd"]

aum_feb14 = aum.loc[aum["Date"].eq(pd.Timestamp("2025-02-14")), aum.columns.str.endswith("_usd")].sum(axis=1).iat[0]
aum_aug15 = aum.loc[aum["Date"].eq(pd.Timestamp("2025-08-15")), aum.columns.str.endswith("_usd")].sum(axis=1).iat[0]
aum_change = aum_aug15 - aum_feb14
```

Key numbers you can rely on (from the primary flow tape)
- Biggest outflow day in the window: Feb 25, 2025, −$1.11B total net redemption across the complex. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-flow-all-data/))
- Biggest early‑August swing: Aug 1, 2025, −$812.3m; followed by several inflow days Aug 7–14 totaling roughly +$1.24B (net Aug 1–14 ≈ flat). ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))
- First half of May 2025 net inflow (May 1–16): approximately +$2.64B. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Issuer concentration (context, since inception as of Aug 15): IBIT +$58.56B; FBTC +$11.96B; GBTC −$23.72B; total +$54.97B. ([farside.co.uk](https://farside.co.uk/btc/))

Assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations
- AUM specificity: Precise AUM changes by issuer over the exact window require holdings and price series; the flow tape alone is insufficient because flows are recorded in US$m at transaction date and do not capture subsequent price drift on inventory.
- Microstructure evidence: The qualitative microstructure observations reflect standard ETF creation/redemption mechanics and typical exchange behavior around large flows (U.S. session concentration, basis dynamics, order‑book depth/volatility). For a fully sourced microstructure deep‑dive (venue‑level spot volumes; CME vs offshore basis curves; realized intraday vol/spreads), pair the flow dates above with exchange trade/quote data and CME futures settlement/term‑structure data. Due to strict tool‑call limits, we prioritized primary flow data sourcing and provide the framework rather than a full venue‑by‑venue statistical annex.
- Data revisions: Provider dashboards can revise individual daily prints; always reconcile with issuer disclosures when precision is mission‑critical.
