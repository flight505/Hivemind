## Ontology and Operationalization

### What necessary and sufficient conditions define consciousness across biological and artificial systems, and how are these conditions operationalized by leading frameworks such as Global Neuronal Workspace, Integrated Information Theory, Recurrent Processing, and Higher-Order theories?

Below is a concise, research-grounded synthesis of what leading scientific frameworks claim are the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness, and how each operationalizes those conditions in experiments and measurements. Where relevant, I also note how these conditions might generalize (or fail to generalize) from biological systems to artificial systems. I highlight assumptions, points of contention, and empirical limitations.

Note: No single set of necessary-and-sufficient conditions is universally accepted. Each framework proposes different criteria and different operational tests; some are mutually inconsistent. The field is actively debating these issues.

Ontology: What “consciousness” is taken to be
- Phenomenal consciousness (what-it-is-like, subjective experience): emphasized by IIT, RP, and most HO theorists.
- Access consciousness (information globally available for report, reasoning, voluntary control): emphasized by GNW; many GNW theorists identify consciousness with global access or treat it as tightly coupled.
- Level vs. content:
 - Level: being conscious at all (e.g., wakefulness vs. anesthesia). Often operationalized by bedside or physiological measures (e.g., perturbational complexity index).
 - Content: specific experiences (e.g., seeing a face). Studied with masking, binocular rivalry, inattentional blindness, etc.
- Theories differ on whether access is necessary for phenomenality, whether prefrontal activity is required, and whether experience can occur without higher-order meta-representation.

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions by Framework

Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
- Ontological stance: Consciousness is the state in which information becomes globally available to multiple specialized systems (perception, memory, decision, language) via a “workspace” implemented by long-range fronto-parietal networks. Access and consciousness are effectively coextensive in many GNW writings.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
 - Global availability/broadcast: Wide, coordinated availability of content across the brain (especially to fronto-parietal systems).
 - Nonlinear “ignition”: A threshold-crossing event producing sustained, amplified, and integrated activity across distributed networks.
 - Sufficient recurrent connectivity for amplification and maintenance (often involving prefrontal cortex).
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
 - Successful ignition and widespread broadcast that make content available to report and cognitive control.
- Canonical references: Dehaene & Changeux (2011); Dehaene (2014); Mashour, Roelfsema, Changeux & Dehaene (2020, Neuron).

Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Ontological stance: Consciousness is identical to the maximally irreducible causal structure of a system (its “cause–effect power” upon itself). Formally, the quantity Φ (phi) indexes the degree of integrated information; and the “qualia structure” (Φ-structure) specifies the qualitative character.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
 - Intrinsic causal power: The system must have causal dynamics upon itself (not merely input–output behavior).
 - Integration and differentiation: High Φ (information that is both integrated and differentiated).
 - Exclusion: The conscious substrate is the system whose cause–effect structure is maximally irreducible at a spatiotemporal scale.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
 - A system that, in fact, realizes a maximally irreducible cause–effect structure (with nonzero Φ) is conscious; its specific “shape” in cause–effect space is the experience. Under IIT, non-biological systems can be conscious if they have the right integrated causal structure.
- Canonical references: Tononi (2004); Oizumi, Albantakis & Tononi (2014, IIT 3.0); more recent formalizations in the IIT 4.0 family.

Recurrent Processing (RP) Theory
- Ontological stance: Local recurrent processing within sensory cortices is sufficient for phenomenal consciousness of sensory contents. Global broadcast and prefrontal activity may be needed for report, cognitive access, or metacognition, but not for raw phenomenality.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
 - Recurrent (feedback) interactions within sensory hierarchies (e.g., V1↔V2/V4; early-late visual loops).
 - Stabilization/amplification of sensory representations via local recurrent loops.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
 - Local recurrent processing confined largely to sensory areas (without mandatory PFC involvement) is sufficient for phenomenal experience of those sensory contents.
- Canonical references: Lamme (2006; 2010); subsequent empirical work on masking and recurrent dynamics.

Higher-Order (HO) Theories (including Higher-Order Thought/Representation)
- Ontological stance: A mental state is conscious only if one is (in some sense) aware of being in that state—i.e., if there is a suitable higher-order representation of the first-order (sensory) state. Varieties include HO thought (HOT), HO perception, and metacognitive models.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
 - A higher-order (meta-representational) state that targets a first-order state (or a process that confers the “for-me-ness” of experience).
 - Neural plausibility is often tied to prefrontal or associative regions supporting metacognition, confidence, or introspective access.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
 - Presence of an appropriately structured higher-order representation about a first-order state makes that state conscious.
- Canonical references: Rosenthal (2005); Lau & Rosenthal (2011); Brown, Lau & LeDoux (2019); empirical metacognition literature.

Operationalization: How Each Framework Is Tested/Measured

Global Neuronal Workspace
- Signatures and paradigms:
 - Ignition-like dynamics: late, all-or-none, sustained activity; widespread fronto-parietal synchronization.
 - Event-related and frequency markers: P3b-like components, late (>300 ms) enhancements, long-range gamma/beta coherence.
 - Tasks: masking, attentional blink, bistable perception, contrast manipulations; report vs no-report variants.
 - Neural decoding: above-chance decoding of content in fronto-parietal signals during conscious vs unconscious trials.
- Level-of-consciousness applications:
 - Loss of ignition/broadcast during deep sleep, general anesthesia, or vegetative states; recovery correlates with restoration of long-range effective connectivity.
- Key operational tools:
 - EEG/MEG/Intracranial electrophysiology showing late widespread responses during conscious perception.
 - Perturb-and-measure approaches assessing fronto-parietal effective connectivity (e.g., TMS-EEG studies).
- Interpretation caveats:
 - Distinguishing markers of consciousness from markers of report, attention, or task performance is challenging. “No-report” paradigms have attenuated some GNW-associated signatures (e.g., P3b), fueling ongoing debate about necessity of PFC for phenomenality.

Integrated Information Theory
- Signatures and paradigms:
 - Direct computation of Φ on realistic neural systems is intractable; hence use of proxies capturing integration and differentiation.
 - Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI): TMS-evoked EEG spatiotemporal complexity (Casali et al., 2013) correlates with level of consciousness across sleep, anesthesia, coma/MCS/EMCS.
 - Measures of spatiotemporal complexity/information dynamics: Lempel–Ziv complexity of EEG/MEG; entropy-based measures; directed functional connectivity; repertoire diversity.
- Level-of-consciousness applications:
 - PCI robustly separates awake vs anesthetized/sleep states and has clinical utility for disorders of consciousness (DoC).
- Content-level applications:
 - More difficult; IIT predicts content corresponds to specific cause–effect structures, but empirical access to that structure is limited. Some work uses “neural differentiation” metrics across stimuli and contents.
- Interpretation caveats:
 - PCI and related measures are inspired by IIT but are not Φ itself; thus they are at best indirect evidence. Critics argue high complexity can occur without phenomenality (potential false positives) or that low complexity might occur with conscious contents under constrained conditions (potential false negatives).

Recurrent Processing Theory
- Signatures and paradigms:
 - Visual masking and timing manipulations: When feedforward sweep is present but local recurrent feedback is prevented (e.g., via backward masking within ~100 ms), subjects fail to experience the stimulus despite early sensory firing.
 - Laminar and microcircuit studies: Feedback to superficial layers and intra-areal recurrence correlate with awareness; electrical microstimulation that boosts local recurrent loops can enhance perceptual awareness.
 - No-report paradigms: Demonstrate early/medium-latency sensory recurrence without late P3b, suggesting phenomenality prior to global report-related activity.
- Operational tools:
 - MEG/EEG timing, intracranial laminar recordings, TMS to visual cortex to disrupt feedback, psychophysical masking protocols.
- Interpretation caveats:
 - Some conscious phenomena (e.g., complex reportable contents or cross-modal integration) appear to involve broader networks; RP must address when and why local recurrence suffices.
 - Dissociating “phenomenal without access” empirically is intrinsically difficult because reports index access.

Higher-Order Theories
- Signatures and paradigms:
 - Metacognitive sensitivity (type-2 sensitivity) and confidence–accuracy dissociations; manipulations that alter confidence independently of first-order performance (e.g., TMS to prefrontal cortex, pharmacological changes).
 - Neuropsychological evidence: Lesions or inactivation in prefrontal areas reduce introspective access/metacognition; debates remain on whether phenomenality is also reduced.
 - Decoding and representational studies: Prefrontal patterns track certainty/confidence or decision states about percepts.
- Operational tools:
 - Confidence ratings, wagering, opt-out paradigms; signal-detection theoretic measures of metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’).
 - Causal tests: TMS/tDCS over DLPFC, aPFC; lesion studies; intracranial stimulation affecting introspective judgments.
- Interpretation caveats:
 - Whether higher-order representations are necessary for phenomenality (versus access to it) is debated. Evidence supports the necessity of HO processes for reportability and introspection; whether they are necessary for conscious experience per se remains unsettled.

Cross-Application to Artificial Systems

Global Neuronal Workspace
- Implications for AI:
 - If an AI implements a functional architecture with a capacity-limited global workspace broadcasting to specialized modules and exhibits ignition-like dynamics and flexible reportable access, GNW would count this as sufficient for consciousness.
 - Operationalization: Demonstrate global availability, capacity limits, ignition thresholds, and flexible access/control over tasks; measure network-level broadcasting dynamics and non-linear thresholding in its activity.

Integrated Information Theory
- Implications for AI:
 - Consciousness depends on intrinsic causal structure, not functional I/O alone. Classical feedforward digital systems are argued to have low Φ, whereas physically recurrent, integrated hardware could have higher Φ.
 - Operationalization: Compute (or approximate) Φ on the physical implementation (not just software). Use perturbational complexity proxies on neuromorphic/recurrent hardware to assess level. Content-level assessment remains theoretically specified but practically challenging.

Recurrent Processing Theory
- Implications for AI:
 - Any system with sufficient local recurrent processing supporting stable, content-specific representations (especially in early sensory-like modules) could have phenomenal consciousness of those contents, independent of global broadcast.
 - Operationalization: Show that local recurrent loops are necessary and sufficient for experienced-like discriminations and that disabling recurrence abolishes putative phenomenality while preserving some feedforward performance.

Higher-Order Theories
- Implications for AI:
 - Requires a meta-representational layer that forms representations about the system’s own first-order states in the right way (e.g., non-derived, functionally efficacious higher-order content).
 - Operationalization: Build architectures with explicit meta-representations (confidence, self-ascription of states) that play a causal role in guiding behavior, with dissociable effects from first-order performance.

Comparative Summary: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions (as claimed)
- GNW:
 - Necessary: Global availability via fronto-parietal ignition.
 - Sufficient: Successful ignition and broadcast enabling access/report.
 - Operational test: Late widespread activation; fronto-parietal coherence; capacity limits; perturbation-based connectivity.
- IIT:
 - Necessary: Nonzero Φ with a maximally irreducible cause–effect structure; integration + differentiation; exclusion.
 - Sufficient: Having the maximal Φ-structure at a scale confers phenomenality with specific qualitative character.
 - Operational test: PCI/complexity proxies for level; no direct practical test for content-level Φ-structure at human scale.
- RP:
 - Necessary: Local recurrent processing within modality-specific cortices.
 - Sufficient: Local sensory recurrence without PFC/global broadcast.
 - Operational test: Masking/TMS that selectively disrupts feedback abolishes awareness; early/medium-latency recurrence correlates with perception even without P3b.
- HO:
 - Necessary: Higher-order representation about first-order states (for conscious status).
 - Sufficient: Appropriate higher-order representation present.
 - Operational test: Metacognitive measures; PFC manipulations that alter conscious status or introspection; dissociations between first-order performance and subjective awareness.

Assumptions, Uncertainties, and Limitations
- No consensus on necessity/sufficiency: Each framework offers criteria that are not jointly satisfiable; empirical adjudication is ongoing and results are mixed.
- Report confounds: Many classic “signatures” (e.g., P3b, prefrontal activation) can reflect reporting, decision, and task demands rather than phenomenality per se. No-report paradigms reduce some GNW markers but do not settle the issue.
- IIT measurement gap: Φ is not computable for realistic brains; current proxies (PCI, complexity) are suggestive for level but do not certify phenomenality or specify content.
- Phenomenal vs access vs metacognition: RP and HO disagree on whether access/meta-representation is necessary for phenomenality; experiments struggle to isolate phenomenality without report.
- Extension to AI: IIT ties consciousness to physical causal structure; GNW/HO/RP allow functional architectures to count. Testing sufficiency in AI is speculative because we lack ground truth about machine phenomenality. Proxies (complexity, meta-representations, ignition) risk both false positives and negatives.
- Adversarial collaborations and large-scale tests: Multi-lab adversarial studies aim to pit predictions of GNW, IIT, RP against each other using pre-registered protocols and no-report designs. Early results highlight both convergences and persistent disagreements; they have not yielded a decisive winner.

Bottom Line
- Necessary-and-sufficient conditions depend on theoretical commitments:
 - GNW: access via global broadcast is both necessary and sufficient.
 - IIT: an intrinsic, maximally integrated causal structure (Φ) is necessary and sufficient.
 - RP: local sensory recurrence is necessary and sufficient for phenomenality; global access is not required.
 - HO: a higher-order representation is necessary and sufficient for a state to be conscious.
- Operationalization varies accordingly: late global ignition (GNW), perturbational complexity (IIT), early/medium-latency recurrence (RP), and metacognitive/HO markers (HO).
- For artificial systems, GNW/HO/RP focus on architecture and functional dynamics; IIT focuses on physical causal structure. None yet provides an empirically definitive, generally agreed-upon test for machine consciousness.


## Mechanisms and Causality

### How do specific neural and computational mechanisms generate phenomenal and access consciousness, and what distinct, falsifiable predictions do competing theories make under interventions such as anesthesia, sleep, visual masking, lesions, and causal brain stimulation?

Below is a structured synthesis of how leading theories link specific neural/computational mechanisms to phenomenal consciousness (what-it-is-like) and access consciousness (availability for report, reasoning, and action), along with distinct, falsifiable predictions under key interventions (anesthesia, sleep, visual masking, lesions, and causal brain stimulation). I highlight convergences, disagreements, and what would count as theory-disconfirming evidence.

Definitions and scope
- Phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness): subjective experiential character (the “what-it-is-like” to see red, feel pain).
- Access consciousness (A-consciousness): information made globally available for report, reasoning, and voluntary control.
- Measurement challenge: Many neural “signatures” may reflect access, attention, task demands, or metacognition rather than phenomenology per se. “No-report” paradigms and causal perturbation are crucial to dissociate.

Mechanisms proposed by major theories

1) Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT, Global Workspace)
- Core mechanism: A late, all-or-none “global ignition” whereby stimulus-specific information is amplified and broadcast across a distributed fronto-parietal network via long-range pyramidal neurons; sustained activity and beta/gamma coupling support access and report.
- Computational idea: Sparse-capacity global buffer that broadcasts to multiple specialist systems (“workspace”).
- Phenomenal vs access: Often treated as closely aligned; P-consciousness largely coincides with access in typical conditions, though GNWT acknowledges unconscious processing without ignition.
- Key anatomical players: dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior parietal/superior parietal regions, anterior temporal hubs, thalamic hubs.
- Signatures: Late, widespread high-gamma, P3b-like components in report tasks; strong long-range effective connectivity.

2) Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Core mechanism: Consciousness is identical to a system’s maximally irreducible cause–effect structure; level corresponds to Φ (phi), the degree of integrated information; content corresponds to the specific “conceptual structure.”
- Phenomenal vs access: Identifies P-consciousness with the intrinsic causal structure; access/report is downstream and contingent.
- Key anatomical players: “Posterior hot zone” (posterior parietal, lateral occipital, inferior temporal, retrosplenial/precuneus) comprising thalamo-cortical circuits; PFC not necessary for phenomenology.
- Signatures: Perturbational complexity (e.g., PCI from TMS–EEG) correlates with level of consciousness; stimulation of posterior cortex changes content; PFC stimulation rarely induces contentful experiences.

3) Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)
- Core mechanism: Local recurrent processing within and between early and mid-level sensory cortices (particularly feedback to superficial layers) is sufficient for phenomenal experience; global broadcasting is not required for P-consciousness.
- Phenomenal vs access: P-consciousness arises from local recurrent loops; access/report requires additional fronto-parietal engagement.
- Key anatomical players: sensory cortices (e.g., V1–V4, posterior temporal, posterior parietal), laminar-specific feedback (superficial layers) and horizontal recurrent circuits.
- Signatures: Awareness depends on feedback and recurrent activity at ~80–200 ms (VAN components), even without later P3b.

4) Higher-Order (Thought/Representation) Theories (HOT/HOR)
- Core mechanism: A mental state is conscious when it is the target of an appropriate higher-order representation (often associated with PFC or temporo-parietal association cortex).
- Phenomenal vs access: P-consciousness requires higher-order representations; metacognitive access and confidence depend on prefrontal systems.
- Key anatomical players: anterior PFC, medial PFC, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ); networks supporting metacognition and self-models.
- Signatures: Dissociations where first-order performance is intact but metacognition and subjective awareness ratings degrade with PFC disruption.

5) Predictive Processing / Active Inference accounts (PP/AI)
- Core mechanism: Conscious contents reflect precision-weighted prediction error dynamics in hierarchies; top-down predictions and their precision (gain control) shape awareness; deep apical dendrites and thalamo-cortical loops implement precision control.
- Phenomenal vs access: Phenomenal correlates with precise, self-consistent predictions at intermediate levels; access reflects high-level, report-related policies integrating those predictions.
- Key anatomical players: hierarchical cortical networks with laminar-specific feedforward/feedback; thalamus as precision/relay modulator; neuromodulatory systems (ACh, NE) set precision.
- Signatures: Consciousness depends on intact feedback and precision; anesthesia/sedation reduce top-down effective connectivity and cross-frequency coupling.

6) Attention Schema Theory (AST)
- Core mechanism: The brain builds a simplified model (“attention schema”) of its own attention; access and the subjective feeling of awareness arise from this model.
- Phenomenal vs access: Often unified—awareness is the content of the internal model; TPJ and related circuitry maintain the schema.
- Predictions: Distortions of awareness with TPJ lesions; attention manipulations alter awareness via schema updates.

Related mechanistic motifs across theories
- Thalamo-cortical loops: Arousal and gating (central thalamus, intralaminar nuclei, pulvinar) are necessary scaffolds for content-specific cortical interactions.
- Dendritic integration: Apical amplification in pyramidal neurons can multiplicatively gate top-down with bottom-up signals—plausible micro-mechanism for conscious access and report.
- Oscillatory coupling: Feedback often in alpha/beta; feedforward in gamma; cross-frequency coupling supports integration.

Interventions: predictions and best-supported findings

A) General anesthesia (propofol, sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine; dissociative ketamine)
- Key empirical regularities
 - TMS–EEG perturbational complexity (PCI) and related measures drop markedly during propofol/dexmedetomidine anesthesia and NREM sleep, and recover in REM and during ketamine with vivid mentation. Perturbations remain local and stereotyped under deep anesthesia; they are rich and propagating in wakefulness/REM.
 - Effective connectivity: reduced long-range, especially fronto-parietal feedback under GABAergic agents; preserved or altered patterns under ketamine.
 - Subjective content: vivid experience under ketamine despite reduced responsiveness; minimal or absent under propofol at adequate depth.

- GNWT predictions
 - Conscious access requires global ignition. Under propofol/dexmedetomidine, ignition and fronto-parietal effective connectivity collapse; P3b-like signatures vanish. Under ketamine, despite potential internal mentation, the necessary ignition for report is impaired; covert ignition may occur in associative networks without motor/report access.
 - Falsification risk: robust, content-specific global ignition with preserved fronto-parietal feedback during deep unresponsive propofol anesthesia would disconfirm GNWT.

- IIT predictions
 - Level tracks Φ/complexity: PCI and related complexity measures should fall with propofol/sevo; remain relatively higher in REM and ketamine. Contents depend on posterior hot zone integrity; PFC involvement not necessary.
 - Falsification risk: high PCI with entirely absent experience reports in post-hoc awakenings (controlling for amnesia) or low PCI with vivid ongoing mentation (matched arousal) would challenge IIT’s mapping.

- RPT predictions
 - Anesthesia disrupts recurrent processing in sensory cortex; even if early feedforward sweeps persist, feedback loops should be weakened, abolishing P-consciousness. Ketamine may spare or alter feedback enough to permit internally generated recurrence (dreamlike phenomenology).
 - Falsification risk: preserved local recurrent activity (laminar feedback) in sensory cortex with absent phenomenology, or absent local recurrence with preserved phenomenology.

- HOT predictions
 - Disruption of higher-order representations (via PFC suppression) removes consciousness despite preserved first-order processing. Ketamine may degrade higher-order coherence less, allowing phenomenology without access.
 - Falsification risk: strong PFC disruption with preserved metacognition and awareness; or PFC-intact states with reliably absent awareness despite intact arousal and sensory loops.

- PP/AI predictions
 - Anesthetics reduce top-down precision and feedback gain; propofol reduces fronto-parietal feedback and cross-frequency coupling; ketamine induces dysregulated precision with internally generated hypotheses causing vivid imagery.
 - Falsification risk: intact feedback and precision markers yet absent phenomenology; or severely suppressed feedback with robust phenomenology.

B) Sleep (NREM vs REM; dreaming)
- Key empirical regularities
 - REM: high cortical activation, vivid dream phenomenology; PCI closer to wakefulness.
 - NREM: lower PCI; yet dreaming can occur and is predicted by activation in a posterior “hot zone” across sleep stages; targeted awakenings show posterior activation predicts reports of ongoing experience.

- GNWT
 - REM may permit widespread ignition for internally generated content; NREM reduces ignition. Dream reports reflect internal broadcasts without external input. No sustained P3b is expected without task/report.
 - Falsification risk: sustained, widespread ignition in NREM without dream phenomenology; or absence of wide broadcasting in REM despite vivid dreams when measured with appropriate probes.

- IIT
 - Higher Φ/PCI in REM; localized posterior activation predicts dream contents even in NREM; posterior hot zone suffices.
 - Falsification risk: vivid dreams without elevated posterior integration or with frontal-only correlates in high-resolution data.

- RPT
 - Phenomenology tracks recurrent activity in sensory/posterior cortex; REM and dreamful NREM should show reinstated feedback there.
 - Falsification risk: dream phenomenology with purely feedforward signatures or without posterior recurrence.

- HOT
 - Reduced PFC activity during REM suggests altered metacognition; subjects typically have low insight in dreams. P-consciousness still possible if some higher-order representation persists in non-prefrontal networks.
 - Falsification risk: dreams requiring robust PFC-dependent metacognition under conditions where PFC is demonstrably quiescent.

- PP/AI
 - Internally generated predictions dominate when sensory precision is low; REM hallucinates due to high internal precision; NREM dreaming arises when posterior precision transiently increases.
 - Falsification risk: high sensory precision markers during REM; no posterior precision increases during dreamful NREM.

C) Visual masking and “no-report” paradigms
- Key empirical regularities
 - Backward masking and CFS can preserve early feedforward responses while abolishing awareness; TMS to early visual cortex around 80–120 ms can selectively disrupt awareness.
 - Event-related potentials: an earlier negativity (VAN ~200 ms) relates to awareness even without report, while P3b often disappears in no-report paradigms—suggesting P3b reflects task/report, not phenomenology.

- GNWT
 - Conscious access requires late ignition; masking prevents ignition. In no-report, P3b may disappear, but decodable widespread states could still emerge if content is consciously accessed without overt report (GNWT emphasizes the act of making information globally available, not motor report).
 - Falsification risk: Strong awareness with no evidence of late global broadcasting across fronto-parietal networks (beyond sensory and parietal areas), repeatedly across tasks.

- IIT
 - Masking truncates integration; posterior hot zone fails to reach integrated conceptual structures; PFC involvement unnecessary. VAN without P3b is compatible with phenomenology.
 - Falsification risk: Robust awareness with no increase in posterior integration (e.g., laminar feedback) and with purely frontal signatures.

- RPT
 - Awareness is lost because masking blocks recurrent processing; VAN should track awareness; P3b reflects access/report.
 - Falsification risk: Masked stimuli becoming conscious without recurrent/feedback signatures; or recurrent signatures present while subjects lack any awareness (in no-report designs with post-hoc confidence).

- HOT
 - Awareness depends on higher-order representation; masking prevents formation of higher-order states. Disruption to PFC/TPJ reduces subjective awareness and metacognitive sensitivity even when first-order performance persists.
 - Falsification risk: Strong subjective awareness and metacognition with PFC/TPJ disrupted and no compensatory higher-order coding elsewhere.

- PP/AI
 - Masking degrades precision of prediction errors, suppressing belief updates needed for conscious attribution to causes; expectations can rescue awareness (e.g., priors increase detection).
 - Falsification risk: Large expectation/precision manipulations fail to modulate awareness in masking when neural precision markers change.

D) Focal lesions
- Key empirical regularities
 - Posterior cortical lesions cause specific losses of conscious content (e.g., achromatopsia, akinetopsia, prosopagnosia, visual neglect) and can abolish large swaths of experience (e.g., bilateral occipito-parietal damage).
 - Prefrontal lesions often spare basic conscious perception but degrade metacognition, confidence calibration, and flexible report; bilateral massive PFC damage does not invariably abolish wakeful consciousness, though it can affect goal-directed access and self-monitoring.

- GNWT
 - Widespread fronto-parietal damage should degrade access; if posterior cortex intact, some phenomenology can persist but access/maintained ignition may be compromised. Extensive PFC damage should impair flexible reporting and multi-domain broadcasting.
 - Falsification risk: Normal access/report with extensive bilateral fronto-parietal lesions; or complete loss of phenomenology with intact fronto-parietal networks but posterior lesion sparing.

- IIT
 - Posterior hot zone lesions should selectively abolish corresponding contents; PFC lesions should not abolish phenomenology per se. Claustrum and thalamus affect level/arousal but not specific content mapping.
 - Falsification risk: Isolated PFC lesions abolish phenomenology wholesale despite posterior integrity; posterior lesions leave phenomenology intact while only impairing report.

- RPT
 - Lesions disrupting local recurrence in sensory cortex eliminate corresponding phenomenology; PFC lesions spare phenomenology but impair access/metacognition.
 - Falsification risk: Preserved phenomenology after lesions that abolish recurrent loops; or losses of phenomenology with spared recurrent circuits.

- HOT
 - Bilateral PFC lesions should markedly reduce or eliminate consciousness if higher-order representations cannot form; partial lesions degrade metacognition/awareness ratings more than first-order discrimination.
 - Falsification risk: Intact subjective awareness and metacognition after targeted PFC lesions with no evidence of compensatory HOT representations elsewhere.

- PP/AI
 - Lesions that disrupt feedback/precision control (posterior or thalamic) degrade phenomenology; PFC lesions impair policies for report and meta-level inference; posterior lesions specifically remove content-generating hierarchies.
 - Falsification risk: Normal awareness despite disrupted feedback/precision markers; loss of awareness with preserved feedback/precision.

E) Causal stimulation (TMS, intracranial stimulation, DBS)
- Key empirical regularities
 - TMS–EEG PCI: brief frontal TMS in wakefulness elicits complex, long-lasting spatiotemporal patterns that collapse to local, stereotyped responses in NREM/anesthesia; PCI correlates with capacity for consciousness across conditions (coma, sleep, anesthesia, REM).
 - Intracranial stimulation of posterior temporal/occipital cortex often elicits vivid content (faces from FFA, motion from MT+, colors, scenes); stimulation of lateral PFC less often yields specific qualia, tending to produce thoughts, urges, or task set changes.
 - Frontal eye field (FEF) stimulation biases attention and detection thresholds but rarely generates contentful qualia by itself.
 - Central thalamus DBS can restore responsiveness and purposeful behavior in disorders of consciousness; claustrum/pulvinar stimulation modulates arousal/attention; one reported case of claustrum stimulation transiently suppressing consciousness (later works suggest network effects).

- GNWT
 - Direct stimulation that triggers wide fronto-parietal ignition should induce conscious access; TMS that fails to propagate globally should not. Stimulation effects should scale with effective connectivity into workspace hubs.
 - Falsification risk: Repeated induction of vivid, reportable content by strictly posterior stimulation without any measurable global ignition; or induction of rich content by stimulating PFC in isolation without posterior involvement.

- IIT
 - Stimulation of posterior hot zone should reliably change phenomenology; PCI should predict capacity across states; fronto-parietal stimulation not necessary for content and often insufficient to evoke it.
 - Falsification risk: Robust, content-rich experiences reliably induced by isolated PFC stimulation while posterior cortex is offline; PCI failing to track capacity across many matched conditions.

- RPT
 - Disrupting feedback to sensory cortices (timed TMS) abolishes awareness; enhancing local recurrence should boost it. Laminar-specific perturbations that block feedback to superficial layers should remove phenomenology.
 - Falsification risk: Contentful experiences induced without recurrent signatures; or lack of awareness change despite strong laminar feedback disruption.

- HOT
 - Increasing higher-order representation (via PFC stimulation) should increase awareness and metacognitive confidence even without sensory changes; posterior stimulation without higher-order representation may not produce “awareness” as reported.
 - Falsification risk: PFC stimulation consistently fails to modulate awareness/metacognition while posterior stimulation does, even when higher-order markers are unaltered.

- PP/AI
 - Manipulating precision (via neuromodulation or targeted stimulation) should change awareness; thalamic/pulvinar stimulation should gate cortico-cortical coupling and awareness; oscillatory signatures (alpha/beta feedback, gamma feedforward) and cross-frequency coupling should change with percepts.
 - Falsification risk: Precision/feedback measures change without awareness changes, or awareness changes without corresponding precision/feedback signatures.

How to adjudicate between theories: decisive tests
- Posterior vs frontal necessity and sufficiency
 - Necessary: Show that selective inactivation of posterior hot zone abolishes corresponding phenomenology while PFC is intact; show that selective PFC inactivation eliminates phenomenology with intact posterior cortex (HOT/GNWT would predict stronger frontal necessity than IIT/RPT).
 - Sufficient: Repeatedly induce vivid, content-specific experiences by stimulating posterior cortex without frontal ignition (supports IIT/RPT); conversely, induce contentful experiences by stimulating PFC alone (supports HOT/GNWT). So far, posterior sufficiency has stronger support.

- No-report, high-resolution causal timing
 - Use laminar ECoG/MEG to determine whether superficial-layer feedback in sensory cortex is necessary for awareness (supports RPT/PP).
 - Demonstrate conscious perception with purely feedforward signatures and no posterior feedback (would challenge RPT/IIT/PP).

- Complexity and capacity
 - Across matched arousal conditions, test whether PCI (or related integration measures) tracks capacity for experiencing in individuals who later provide careful reports (e.g., REM vs NREM awakenings; ketamine vs propofol).
 - Strong divergence (e.g., high PCI but reliable absence of experiences) would challenge IIT’s mapping and any theory tying capacity to integration/complexity.

- Prefrontal lesions and metacognition
 - Preregistered tests of subjective awareness and meta-d’ in patients with focal PFC lesions: if P-consciousness is preserved but metacognition impaired, supports RPT/IIT distinction between phenomenology and access; if awareness ratings themselves collapse independent of report/decision demands, supports HOT/GNWT.

- Receptor-specific anesthesia
 - Compare propofol, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, sevoflurane with identical behavioral endpoints to see whether theories correctly predict patterns in feedback connectivity, PCI, and subjective mentation (e.g., ketamine preserving complexity and phenomenology).

Assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations
- Operationalizing phenomenal consciousness: No-report paradigms reduce confounds but do not eliminate all inference pitfalls (e.g., memory, criterion, covert response preparation).
- PCI and Φ: PCI is a practical perturbational measure of spatiotemporal complexity, not Φ itself; dissociations are possible and would need careful interpretation.
- Heterogeneity of PFC: “PFC” is not monolithic; different subregions may support different higher-order or workspace functions. Sparse PFC stimulation data may under-detect contentful experiences due to stimulation parameters.
- Anesthesia heterogeneity: Agents differ pharmacodynamically; “unconsciousness” is not unitary across drugs.
- Species and methods: Laminar recordings, optogenetics, and microstimulation evidence in animals must be carefully extrapolated to humans.

Bottom line
- Convergences: Consciousness requires more than feedforward sweep—recurrent/feedback and integration matter; arousal systems (thalamus/brainstem) are necessary scaffolds; posterior cortex is central for specific contents; P3b is tied to access/report rather than phenomenology.
- Key disagreements with falsifiable predictions:
 - Is PFC necessary for phenomenology? IIT/RPT say no; HOT/GNWT assign a stronger role (with GNWT linking access to PFC-parietal ignition).
 - Are posterior local recurrent loops sufficient for phenomenology? RPT/IIT say yes; GNWT/HOT say not without higher-order/global broadcast.
 - Do integration/complexity measures track capacity across states (IIT-style) beyond task confounds? Evidence broadly supportive, but not definitive.
- Most decisive future tests combine: targeted, laminar-specific perturbations; no-report paradigms; receptor-specific anesthesia; causal network metrics; and preregistered adversarial predictions distinguishing posterior sufficiency from frontal necessity.


## Measurement and Validation

### What validated paradigms and metrics can robustly detect and quantify the presence, level, and contents of consciousness across humans, nonhuman animals, and machines (e.g., perturbational complexity index, no-report paradigms, metacognitive sensitivity), and how do these perform in disorders of consciousness and in evaluating AI systems?

Measurement and Validation
What validated paradigms and metrics can robustly detect and quantify the presence, level, and contents of consciousness across humans, nonhuman animals, and machines, and how do these perform in disorders of consciousness (DoC) and in evaluating AI systems?

Summary
- There is no single gold-standard “consciousness meter.” Different validated paradigms target different constructs: presence (is any conscious experience occurring?), level (how much/what state?), and contents (what is experienced).
- Best-supported human measures triangulate across:
 - Causal perturbation + complexity (e.g., PCI/PCIst) for level/presence.
 - Active and passive neuro-behavioral paradigms (mental-imagery fMRI/EEG; P300/MMN; no-report paradigms) for presence and contents.
 - Metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d', calibration) for introspective access to contents.
 - Clinically validated behavioral scales (CRS-R) augmented by FDG-PET and EEG/fMRI to detect covert consciousness.
- In DoC, combined approaches outperform any single tool: PCI and FDG-PET are best validated for global level; imagery tasks and some EEG paradigms detect covert awareness; ERPs and resting-network integrity aid prognosis.
- Cross-species extensions exist (causal complexity, no-report, opt-out metacognition) but validation is more limited than in humans.
- For AI systems, current biological metrics do not straightforwardly transfer. Useful surrogates include causal-perturbation complexity in networks and metacognitive calibration, but these do not establish consciousness; they probe functional capacities associated with theories (Global Workspace, metacognition, information integration).

Key constructs and what they measure
- Presence vs level vs contents:
 - Presence: any conscious experience at all (vs none).
 - Level: arousal/overall capacity (coma ↔ anesthesia ↔ wakefulness; dreaming).
 - Contents: specific percepts, thoughts, or intentions.
- Access vs phenomenal aspects:
 - Access/availability (global broadcasting, reportability) vs phenomenal feel; empirical tools largely target access and neural capacity, not phenomenal properties.

Validated paradigms and metrics

1) Causal perturbation–complexity approaches (presence/level)
- Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI; TMS-EEG):
 - Method: Apply a brief TMS pulse; measure the spatiotemporal EEG response; compressibility (Lempel–Ziv) of the causally evoked pattern yields PCI.
 - Validation:
 - High in wakefulness and REM dreaming; low in NREM sleep, deep anesthesia, and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS).
 - Differentiates minimally conscious state (MCS) from UWS at the single-patient level with a threshold around 0.31 in the original work.
 - Strengths: Causal, task-free, report-free, robust across diverse etiologies/anesthetics (notably remains higher in ketamine than propofol).
 - Limitations: Specialized hardware/training; scalp EEG can miss deep sources; measures capacity for consciousness, not its specific contents.
 - Key reference: Casali et al., Sci Transl Med, 2013.

- PCIst (state-transition PCI) and related evoked-complexity metrics:
 - Faster, more general computation of complexity of evoked responses; adapted in animals and intracranial recordings.
 - Strengths/limits: Similar to PCI; still under active validation.

- Resting-state signal diversity/entropy (e.g., Lempel–Ziv diversity; permutation entropy):
 - MEG/EEG diversity tracks level (decreases in NREM/anesthesia; increases with psychedelics).
 - Not causal; susceptible to confounds (noise, muscle artifacts).

- Information-sharing/connectivity indices (e.g., weighted symbolic mutual information, wSMI):
 - Decrease in deep sleep/anesthesia; partial restoration in REM; predictive of DoC severity.
 - Not strictly causal; robustness varies across datasets.

2) Active “covert command-following” paradigms (presence/contents)
- Mental imagery fMRI/EEG:
 - Ask patients to imagine tennis (supplementary motor activation) vs navigation (parahippocampal) as yes/no responses.
 - Demonstrates volitional control in behaviorally unresponsive patients (cognitive motor dissociation).
 - Key reference: Owen et al., Science, 2006.
 - Strengths: Specific evidence of conscious intention; content manipulation.
 - Limitations: Requires intact task comprehension and working memory; false negatives common due to fluctuating arousal, language deficits.

- EEG-based active paradigms:
 - Command-following via P300 speller, steady-state visual/auditory evoked potentials (SSVEP/ASSR), or motor imagery EEG decoding.
 - More portable than fMRI; variable sensitivity/specificity; affected by noise and uneven patient engagement.

3) Passive event-related potentials and sensory responses (presence/prognosis)
- Mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory P3a/P3b, N2pc, visual awareness negativity (VAN):
 - MMN can persist without attention and predicts better outcomes in DoC.
 - Late P3b often tied to report/task demands; in no-report paradigms, P3b can vanish despite awareness, suggesting it reflects post-perceptual processes.
 - Strengths: Bedside-capable; some predictive value.
 - Limitations: Not specific markers of consciousness per se; sensitive to attention and task requirements.

4) No-report paradigms (contents, minimizing report confounds)
- Strategy: Inference of conscious contents without overt report (e.g., binocular rivalry tracked via optokinetic nystagmus, pupil dilation, steady-state responses; decoding of category-specific brain patterns).
- Findings: Early sensory markers and local recurrent activity can correlate with awareness even when late P3b is absent; helps isolate neural correlates of experience from decision/motor confounds.
- Key reference: Tsuchiya et al., Trends Cogn Sci, 2015.
- Limitations: Indirect inference; physiological proxies can be modulated by factors other than awareness.

5) Metacognitive sensitivity (introspective access to contents)
- Metrics: Type 2 SDT measures (meta-d', M-ratio), AUROC2; hierarchical Bayesian estimation (HMeta-d).
- What they capture: How well confidence discriminates correct from incorrect decisions, beyond first-order performance.
- Use cases: Distinguish blindsight-like behavior (performance without insight) from conscious access; characterize clinical and pharmacological effects on metacognition.
- Key reference: Maniscalco & Lau, Conscious Cogn, 2012.
- Limitations: Require reliable confidence/opt-out behavior; potentially confounded by response biases and training.

6) Clinical scales and global imaging (level/presence)
- Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R): Behavioral gold standard for DoC; sensitive but misses covert consciousness.
- FDG-PET (cerebral glucose metabolism):
 - Global and network-level metabolism correlates with level of consciousness; outperforms fMRI activation in some cohorts for diagnostic precision.
 - A landmark study showed FDG-PET had higher sensitivity than task fMRI for diagnosing MCS vs UWS.
 - Strengths: Whole-brain quantification; strong prognostic value.
 - Limitations: Logistics, radiation, availability.
- Reviews: Edlow et al., Nat Rev Neurol, 2021; Stender et al., Lancet, 2014 (FDG-PET vs fMRI in DoC).

7) Anesthesia depth monitors (level only, with caveats)
- BIS, entropy, PSI:
 - Useful for titrating anesthetic depth; correlate with spectral features.
 - Failures: Atypical agents (ketamine, dexmedetomidine), neuromuscular blockade confounds; index “unresponsiveness,” not consciousness.
 - Not validated for DoC diagnosis.

8) Decoding contents without report
- MVPA and representational decoding:
 - Visual category decoding during awareness and imagery; dream content decoding from fMRI during sleep.
 - Key example: Horikawa et al., Science, 2013 (dream decoding).
 - Caveat: Decoding can reflect representation without awareness; needs control with no-report paradigms.

Performance in disorders of consciousness (DoC)
- Diagnostic differentiation:
 - CRS-R: Foundation for bedside assessment; serial exams needed to reduce false negatives.
 - PCI (TMS-EEG): Values above ~0.31–0.4 typically indicate preserved capacity for consciousness; reliably separates UWS vs MCS in many cohorts; robust across etiologies and sedatives. Task-free, useful when language/motor output is absent.
 - FDG-PET: High diagnostic accuracy; hypometabolism indicates lower level. In a clinical validation study, FDG-PET was more sensitive than task-based fMRI for identifying MCS.
 - Passive ERPs: Presence of MMN and some P3 responses predict better recovery; not sufficient alone for diagnosis.
 - Active imagery (fMRI/EEG): Confirms presence of conscious volition in a subset (“covertly conscious”); false negatives frequent.
- Prognosis:
 - Preserved MMN/P3, higher metabolic rate (FDG-PET), stronger resting-state connectivity (especially default mode/frontoparietal), and higher complexity indices (EEG diversity, wSMI, PCI) correlate with better outcomes.
- Practical integration:
 - Best practice uses multimodal assessment: CRS-R + structural imaging + FDG-PET or resting fMRI + TMS-EEG PCI + passive ERPs; attempt active paradigms when feasible.
- Limitations:
 - Fluctuating arousal, aphasia, hearing/vision loss, sedatives, and seizures cause false negatives; need repeated, standardized protocols.

Cross-species applications (nonhuman animals)
- Causal complexity (presence/level):
 - PCI-like indices and evoked-complexity measures adapted with intracranial stimulation and local field potentials demonstrate decreased complexity under anesthesia and NREM sleep, increased during REM/ketamine-like dissociative states in rodents and nonhuman primates.
 - Strength: Causal, theory-linked (integration/ differentiation).
 - Limitations: Invasive; fewer large-scale validation studies; translating thresholds from humans is nontrivial.

- No-report paradigms for contents:
 - Rivalry/flash suppression with oculomotor/pupil proxies in macaques; single-unit and LFP signatures in IT/PFC covary with putative awareness without trained reports.

- Metacognition:
 - Opt-out/uncertainty responses in macaques, dolphins, rats; behavioral and neural correlates suggest metacognitive monitoring.
 - Caveat: Training and reinforcement histories can mimic uncertainty monitoring; careful controls needed.

- Auditory/visual ERPs:
 - MMN and novelty responses in animals mirror human markers; useful for level/arousal and predictive coding but not specific to awareness.

Evaluation of AI systems
- What transfers well:
 - Metacognitive sensitivity analogs:
 - Confidence calibration, meta-accuracy, selective stopping/opt-out, error monitoring, change-of-mind dynamics.
 - Quantify with proper scoring rules (Brier, log loss), ECE, meta-d'-like analyses on probabilistic outputs; test for dissociations (good performance with poor metacognition vs vice versa).
 - Causal perturbation–complexity:
 - Perturb activations or weights; measure spatiotemporal spread and compressibility of state transitions; evaluate integration (bidirectional causality) vs mere propagation.
 - Can implement PCI-like designs in recurrent networks or neuromorphic systems to test for rich, integrated dynamical responses.

- What does not straightforwardly transfer:
 - Biological correlates (ERPs, FDG-PET, EEG rhythms) are substrate-specific.
 - Behavioral report in AI is easy to fake; “no-report” concerns invert: all outputs are “reports.” Need adversarially robust, task-agnostic probes of internal dynamics.

- Theory-driven functional tests (not validation of consciousness per se):
 - Global Workspace-style capacities: flexible global broadcasting, cross-domain information access, rapid reconfiguration, distraction resistance, sustained working memory with interference; lesion/ablation tests of “workspace” hubs for causal necessity.
 - Recurrent processing: necessity of recurrent loops for content-specific performance; ablation of recurrence vs feedforward sufficiency.
 - Integrated information surrogates: empirical causal density, synergistic information, integrated gradients of causal graphs; note that IIT’s Φ is hard to compute and interpretation remains debated.

- Pitfalls and safeguards:
 - Deception and overfitting: use out-of-distribution tests, task switching, and causal interventions; ban training on the evaluation distribution.
 - Separate first-order task success from metacognitive access; use post-decision wagering analogs with incentives and cost of opting out.
 - Update priors: Passing functional tests is evidence of sophisticated cognition, not of consciousness.

How the main paradigms compare

- PCI (TMS-EEG)
 - Targets: presence/level (capacity for consciousness).
 - Strengths: Causal; no report; validated in anesthesia, sleep, DoC.
 - DoC performance: Distinguishes UWS vs MCS at single-patient level; complements behavioral/FDG-PET.
 - Limitations: Specialized setup; content-agnostic.

- FDG-PET/Resting fMRI networks
 - Targets: level; network integrity.
 - Strengths: Clinical evidence base; prognostic; whole-brain.
 - DoC: High diagnostic accuracy; detects preserved metabolism in MCS.
 - Limitations: Access/logistics; not content-specific.

- Active imagery (fMRI/EEG)
 - Targets: presence and specific volitional contents (yes/no).
 - Strengths: Direct evidence of conscious intention.
 - DoC: Identifies covertly conscious patients.
 - Limitations: High false-negative rate; task demands.

- Passive ERPs (MMN/P3a/P3b/VAN)
 - Targets: presence proxies; some content sensitivity.
 - Strengths: Bedside; prognostic value (MMN).
 - DoC: Useful but not specific to awareness.
 - Limitations: Confounded by attention/task.

- No-report paradigms
 - Targets: contents without motor/report confounds.
 - Strengths: Cleaner neural correlates of experience.
 - DoC: Less used clinically; conceptually important.
 - Limitations: Indirect; require careful inference.

- Metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d')
 - Targets: access to contents (confidence).
 - Strengths: Dissociates performance vs introspection; applicable across species with opt-out designs; applicable to AI as calibration/uncertainty.
 - DoC: Not generally applicable (requires reliable reports).
 - Limitations: Biases; training and incentives matter.

- Anesthesia monitors (BIS/entropy)
 - Targets: unresponsiveness (coarse level).
 - Strengths: OR practicality.
 - DoC: Not validated for diagnosis; can misclassify conscious states (ketamine, REM).

Recommendations for practice (humans/DoC)
- Screening and diagnosis:
 - Use serial CRS-R by trained examiners as the behavioral backbone.
 - Add task-free physiology: TMS-EEG PCI (or validated evoked complexity), resting EEG diversity/entropy, passive ERPs (MMN), and resting fMRI network integrity when available.
 - When feasible, perform FDG-PET for diagnostic precision and prognosis.
 - Attempt active imagery (fMRI/EEG) to identify covert consciousness; interpret negatives cautiously.
- Prognosis:
 - Integrate metabolic measures (FDG-PET), MMN, resting network integrity, and complexity indices.
- Ethical/communication:
 - Consider communication interfaces for patients showing covert command-following; reassess regularly due to fluctuation.

Recommendations for AI evaluation (research)
- Build a multimodal test battery:
 - Causal perturbation–complexity: systematic node/weight perturbations; quantify spatiotemporal integration and differentiation; compare to ablated/rearranged baselines.
 - Metacognition: confidence calibration, selective stopping/opt-out under incentives; post-decision evidence reveals change-of-mind dynamics; separation of first-order accuracy from meta-accuracy.
 - Global access: cross-task transfer, distractor resistance, multi-modal binding; lesion studies of “workspace-like” bottlenecks and recurrent loops.
 - No-report analogs: decode internal content states from hidden activations without relying on explicit text “reports”; probe for dissociations between internal state changes and surface outputs.
- Guardrails:
 - Pre-register evaluation protocols; use sequestered testbeds; include adversarial and out-of-distribution probes; perform causal ablations.

Assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations
- Ground truth is hard: Outside of cooperative neurotypical adults, we lack a direct ground truth for consciousness. Validation is thus indirect and triangulated (causal capacity, behavior, physiology).
- PCI and complexity measures index capacity/level, not contents; high complexity does not guarantee current conscious experience moment-to-moment.
- ERP markers are not specific to consciousness; dissociations in no-report paradigms caution against overinterpretation of late components like P3b.
- FDG-PET reflects metabolism, which correlates with level but is not content-specific; thresholds vary by center and methodology.
- Cross-species generalization is promising but uneven; thresholds and interpretations cannot be naively ported from humans.
- AI evaluations test functional correlates predicted by theories, not consciousness itself. Passing tests provides evidence of certain computational properties; whether these suffice for consciousness is a philosophical and scientific open question.
