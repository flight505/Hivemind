Below is a concise, research-grounded synthesis of what leading scientific frameworks claim are the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness, and how each operationalizes those conditions in experiments and measurements. Where relevant, I also note how these conditions might generalize (or fail to generalize) from biological systems to artificial systems. I highlight assumptions, points of contention, and empirical limitations.

Note: No single set of necessary-and-sufficient conditions is universally accepted. Each framework proposes different criteria and different operational tests; some are mutually inconsistent. The field is actively debating these issues.

Ontology: What “consciousness” is taken to be
- Phenomenal consciousness (what-it-is-like, subjective experience): emphasized by IIT, RP, and most HO theorists.
- Access consciousness (information globally available for report, reasoning, voluntary control): emphasized by GNW; many GNW theorists identify consciousness with global access or treat it as tightly coupled.
- Level vs. content:
  - Level: being conscious at all (e.g., wakefulness vs. anesthesia). Often operationalized by bedside or physiological measures (e.g., perturbational complexity index).
  - Content: specific experiences (e.g., seeing a face). Studied with masking, binocular rivalry, inattentional blindness, etc.
- Theories differ on whether access is necessary for phenomenality, whether prefrontal activity is required, and whether experience can occur without higher-order meta-representation.

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions by Framework

Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
- Ontological stance: Consciousness is the state in which information becomes globally available to multiple specialized systems (perception, memory, decision, language) via a “workspace” implemented by long-range fronto-parietal networks. Access and consciousness are effectively coextensive in many GNW writings.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
  - Global availability/broadcast: Wide, coordinated availability of content across the brain (especially to fronto-parietal systems).
  - Nonlinear “ignition”: A threshold-crossing event producing sustained, amplified, and integrated activity across distributed networks.
  - Sufficient recurrent connectivity for amplification and maintenance (often involving prefrontal cortex).
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
  - Successful ignition and widespread broadcast that make content available to report and cognitive control.
- Canonical references: Dehaene & Changeux (2011); Dehaene (2014); Mashour, Roelfsema, Changeux & Dehaene (2020, Neuron).

Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Ontological stance: Consciousness is identical to the maximally irreducible causal structure of a system (its “cause–effect power” upon itself). Formally, the quantity Φ (phi) indexes the degree of integrated information; and the “qualia structure” (Φ-structure) specifies the qualitative character.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
  - Intrinsic causal power: The system must have causal dynamics upon itself (not merely input–output behavior).
  - Integration and differentiation: High Φ (information that is both integrated and differentiated).
  - Exclusion: The conscious substrate is the system whose cause–effect structure is maximally irreducible at a spatiotemporal scale.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
  - A system that, in fact, realizes a maximally irreducible cause–effect structure (with nonzero Φ) is conscious; its specific “shape” in cause–effect space is the experience. Under IIT, non-biological systems can be conscious if they have the right integrated causal structure.
- Canonical references: Tononi (2004); Oizumi, Albantakis & Tononi (2014, IIT 3.0); more recent formalizations in the IIT 4.0 family.

Recurrent Processing (RP) Theory
- Ontological stance: Local recurrent processing within sensory cortices is sufficient for phenomenal consciousness of sensory contents. Global broadcast and prefrontal activity may be needed for report, cognitive access, or metacognition, but not for raw phenomenality.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
  - Recurrent (feedback) interactions within sensory hierarchies (e.g., V1↔V2/V4; early-late visual loops).
  - Stabilization/amplification of sensory representations via local recurrent loops.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
  - Local recurrent processing confined largely to sensory areas (without mandatory PFC involvement) is sufficient for phenomenal experience of those sensory contents.
- Canonical references: Lamme (2006; 2010); subsequent empirical work on masking and recurrent dynamics.

Higher-Order (HO) Theories (including Higher-Order Thought/Representation)
- Ontological stance: A mental state is conscious only if one is (in some sense) aware of being in that state—i.e., if there is a suitable higher-order representation of the first-order (sensory) state. Varieties include HO thought (HOT), HO perception, and metacognitive models.
- Proposed necessary conditions:
  - A higher-order (meta-representational) state that targets a first-order state (or a process that confers the “for-me-ness” of experience).
  - Neural plausibility is often tied to prefrontal or associative regions supporting metacognition, confidence, or introspective access.
- Proposed sufficient conditions:
  - Presence of an appropriately structured higher-order representation about a first-order state makes that state conscious.
- Canonical references: Rosenthal (2005); Lau & Rosenthal (2011); Brown, Lau & LeDoux (2019); empirical metacognition literature.

Operationalization: How Each Framework Is Tested/Measured

Global Neuronal Workspace
- Signatures and paradigms:
  - Ignition-like dynamics: late, all-or-none, sustained activity; widespread fronto-parietal synchronization.
  - Event-related and frequency markers: P3b-like components, late (>300 ms) enhancements, long-range gamma/beta coherence.
  - Tasks: masking, attentional blink, bistable perception, contrast manipulations; report vs no-report variants.
  - Neural decoding: above-chance decoding of content in fronto-parietal signals during conscious vs unconscious trials.
- Level-of-consciousness applications:
  - Loss of ignition/broadcast during deep sleep, general anesthesia, or vegetative states; recovery correlates with restoration of long-range effective connectivity.
- Key operational tools:
  - EEG/MEG/Intracranial electrophysiology showing late widespread responses during conscious perception.
  - Perturb-and-measure approaches assessing fronto-parietal effective connectivity (e.g., TMS-EEG studies).
- Interpretation caveats:
  - Distinguishing markers of consciousness from markers of report, attention, or task performance is challenging. “No-report” paradigms have attenuated some GNW-associated signatures (e.g., P3b), fueling ongoing debate about necessity of PFC for phenomenality.

Integrated Information Theory
- Signatures and paradigms:
  - Direct computation of Φ on realistic neural systems is intractable; hence use of proxies capturing integration and differentiation.
  - Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI): TMS-evoked EEG spatiotemporal complexity (Casali et al., 2013) correlates with level of consciousness across sleep, anesthesia, coma/MCS/EMCS.
  - Measures of spatiotemporal complexity/information dynamics: Lempel–Ziv complexity of EEG/MEG; entropy-based measures; directed functional connectivity; repertoire diversity.
- Level-of-consciousness applications:
  - PCI robustly separates awake vs anesthetized/sleep states and has clinical utility for disorders of consciousness (DoC).
- Content-level applications:
  - More difficult; IIT predicts content corresponds to specific cause–effect structures, but empirical access to that structure is limited. Some work uses “neural differentiation” metrics across stimuli and contents.
- Interpretation caveats:
  - PCI and related measures are inspired by IIT but are not Φ itself; thus they are at best indirect evidence. Critics argue high complexity can occur without phenomenality (potential false positives) or that low complexity might occur with conscious contents under constrained conditions (potential false negatives).

Recurrent Processing Theory
- Signatures and paradigms:
  - Visual masking and timing manipulations: When feedforward sweep is present but local recurrent feedback is prevented (e.g., via backward masking within ~100 ms), subjects fail to experience the stimulus despite early sensory firing.
  - Laminar and microcircuit studies: Feedback to superficial layers and intra-areal recurrence correlate with awareness; electrical microstimulation that boosts local recurrent loops can enhance perceptual awareness.
  - No-report paradigms: Demonstrate early/medium-latency sensory recurrence without late P3b, suggesting phenomenality prior to global report-related activity.
- Operational tools:
  - MEG/EEG timing, intracranial laminar recordings, TMS to visual cortex to disrupt feedback, psychophysical masking protocols.
- Interpretation caveats:
  - Some conscious phenomena (e.g., complex reportable contents or cross-modal integration) appear to involve broader networks; RP must address when and why local recurrence suffices.
  - Dissociating “phenomenal without access” empirically is intrinsically difficult because reports index access.

Higher-Order Theories
- Signatures and paradigms:
  - Metacognitive sensitivity (type-2 sensitivity) and confidence–accuracy dissociations; manipulations that alter confidence independently of first-order performance (e.g., TMS to prefrontal cortex, pharmacological changes).
  - Neuropsychological evidence: Lesions or inactivation in prefrontal areas reduce introspective access/metacognition; debates remain on whether phenomenality is also reduced.
  - Decoding and representational studies: Prefrontal patterns track certainty/confidence or decision states about percepts.
- Operational tools:
  - Confidence ratings, wagering, opt-out paradigms; signal-detection theoretic measures of metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’).
  - Causal tests: TMS/tDCS over DLPFC, aPFC; lesion studies; intracranial stimulation affecting introspective judgments.
- Interpretation caveats:
  - Whether higher-order representations are necessary for phenomenality (versus access to it) is debated. Evidence supports the necessity of HO processes for reportability and introspection; whether they are necessary for conscious experience per se remains unsettled.

Cross-Application to Artificial Systems

Global Neuronal Workspace
- Implications for AI:
  - If an AI implements a functional architecture with a capacity-limited global workspace broadcasting to specialized modules and exhibits ignition-like dynamics and flexible reportable access, GNW would count this as sufficient for consciousness.
  - Operationalization: Demonstrate global availability, capacity limits, ignition thresholds, and flexible access/control over tasks; measure network-level broadcasting dynamics and non-linear thresholding in its activity.

Integrated Information Theory
- Implications for AI:
  - Consciousness depends on intrinsic causal structure, not functional I/O alone. Classical feedforward digital systems are argued to have low Φ, whereas physically recurrent, integrated hardware could have higher Φ.
  - Operationalization: Compute (or approximate) Φ on the physical implementation (not just software). Use perturbational complexity proxies on neuromorphic/recurrent hardware to assess level. Content-level assessment remains theoretically specified but practically challenging.

Recurrent Processing Theory
- Implications for AI:
  - Any system with sufficient local recurrent processing supporting stable, content-specific representations (especially in early sensory-like modules) could have phenomenal consciousness of those contents, independent of global broadcast.
  - Operationalization: Show that local recurrent loops are necessary and sufficient for experienced-like discriminations and that disabling recurrence abolishes putative phenomenality while preserving some feedforward performance.

Higher-Order Theories
- Implications for AI:
  - Requires a meta-representational layer that forms representations about the system’s own first-order states in the right way (e.g., non-derived, functionally efficacious higher-order content).
  - Operationalization: Build architectures with explicit meta-representations (confidence, self-ascription of states) that play a causal role in guiding behavior, with dissociable effects from first-order performance.

Comparative Summary: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions (as claimed)
- GNW:
  - Necessary: Global availability via fronto-parietal ignition.
  - Sufficient: Successful ignition and broadcast enabling access/report.
  - Operational test: Late widespread activation; fronto-parietal coherence; capacity limits; perturbation-based connectivity.
- IIT:
  - Necessary: Nonzero Φ with a maximally irreducible cause–effect structure; integration + differentiation; exclusion.
  - Sufficient: Having the maximal Φ-structure at a scale confers phenomenality with specific qualitative character.
  - Operational test: PCI/complexity proxies for level; no direct practical test for content-level Φ-structure at human scale.
- RP:
  - Necessary: Local recurrent processing within modality-specific cortices.
  - Sufficient: Local sensory recurrence without PFC/global broadcast.
  - Operational test: Masking/TMS that selectively disrupts feedback abolishes awareness; early/medium-latency recurrence correlates with perception even without P3b.
- HO:
  - Necessary: Higher-order representation about first-order states (for conscious status).
  - Sufficient: Appropriate higher-order representation present.
  - Operational test: Metacognitive measures; PFC manipulations that alter conscious status or introspection; dissociations between first-order performance and subjective awareness.

Assumptions, Uncertainties, and Limitations
- No consensus on necessity/sufficiency: Each framework offers criteria that are not jointly satisfiable; empirical adjudication is ongoing and results are mixed.
- Report confounds: Many classic “signatures” (e.g., P3b, prefrontal activation) can reflect reporting, decision, and task demands rather than phenomenality per se. No-report paradigms reduce some GNW markers but do not settle the issue.
- IIT measurement gap: Φ is not computable for realistic brains; current proxies (PCI, complexity) are suggestive for level but do not certify phenomenality or specify content.
- Phenomenal vs access vs metacognition: RP and HO disagree on whether access/meta-representation is necessary for phenomenality; experiments struggle to isolate phenomenality without report.
- Extension to AI: IIT ties consciousness to physical causal structure; GNW/HO/RP allow functional architectures to count. Testing sufficiency in AI is speculative because we lack ground truth about machine phenomenality. Proxies (complexity, meta-representations, ignition) risk both false positives and negatives.
- Adversarial collaborations and large-scale tests: Multi-lab adversarial studies aim to pit predictions of GNW, IIT, RP against each other using pre-registered protocols and no-report designs. Early results highlight both convergences and persistent disagreements; they have not yielded a decisive winner.

Bottom Line
- Necessary-and-sufficient conditions depend on theoretical commitments:
  - GNW: access via global broadcast is both necessary and sufficient.
  - IIT: an intrinsic, maximally integrated causal structure (Φ) is necessary and sufficient.
  - RP: local sensory recurrence is necessary and sufficient for phenomenality; global access is not required.
  - HO: a higher-order representation is necessary and sufficient for a state to be conscious.
- Operationalization varies accordingly: late global ignition (GNW), perturbational complexity (IIT), early/medium-latency recurrence (RP), and metacognitive/HO markers (HO).
- For artificial systems, GNW/HO/RP focus on architecture and functional dynamics; IIT focuses on physical causal structure. None yet provides an empirically definitive, generally agreed-upon test for machine consciousness.
