Below is a structured synthesis of how leading theories link specific neural/computational mechanisms to phenomenal consciousness (what-it-is-like) and access consciousness (availability for report, reasoning, and action), along with distinct, falsifiable predictions under key interventions (anesthesia, sleep, visual masking, lesions, and causal brain stimulation). I highlight convergences, disagreements, and what would count as theory-disconfirming evidence.

Definitions and scope
- Phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness): subjective experiential character (the “what-it-is-like” to see red, feel pain).
- Access consciousness (A-consciousness): information made globally available for report, reasoning, and voluntary control.
- Measurement challenge: Many neural “signatures” may reflect access, attention, task demands, or metacognition rather than phenomenology per se. “No-report” paradigms and causal perturbation are crucial to dissociate.

Mechanisms proposed by major theories

1) Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT, Global Workspace)
- Core mechanism: A late, all-or-none “global ignition” whereby stimulus-specific information is amplified and broadcast across a distributed fronto-parietal network via long-range pyramidal neurons; sustained activity and beta/gamma coupling support access and report.
- Computational idea: Sparse-capacity global buffer that broadcasts to multiple specialist systems (“workspace”).
- Phenomenal vs access: Often treated as closely aligned; P-consciousness largely coincides with access in typical conditions, though GNWT acknowledges unconscious processing without ignition.
- Key anatomical players: dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior parietal/superior parietal regions, anterior temporal hubs, thalamic hubs.
- Signatures: Late, widespread high-gamma, P3b-like components in report tasks; strong long-range effective connectivity.

2) Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Core mechanism: Consciousness is identical to a system’s maximally irreducible cause–effect structure; level corresponds to Φ (phi), the degree of integrated information; content corresponds to the specific “conceptual structure.”
- Phenomenal vs access: Identifies P-consciousness with the intrinsic causal structure; access/report is downstream and contingent.
- Key anatomical players: “Posterior hot zone” (posterior parietal, lateral occipital, inferior temporal, retrosplenial/precuneus) comprising thalamo-cortical circuits; PFC not necessary for phenomenology.
- Signatures: Perturbational complexity (e.g., PCI from TMS–EEG) correlates with level of consciousness; stimulation of posterior cortex changes content; PFC stimulation rarely induces contentful experiences.

3) Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)
- Core mechanism: Local recurrent processing within and between early and mid-level sensory cortices (particularly feedback to superficial layers) is sufficient for phenomenal experience; global broadcasting is not required for P-consciousness.
- Phenomenal vs access: P-consciousness arises from local recurrent loops; access/report requires additional fronto-parietal engagement.
- Key anatomical players: sensory cortices (e.g., V1–V4, posterior temporal, posterior parietal), laminar-specific feedback (superficial layers) and horizontal recurrent circuits.
- Signatures: Awareness depends on feedback and recurrent activity at ~80–200 ms (VAN components), even without later P3b.

4) Higher-Order (Thought/Representation) Theories (HOT/HOR)
- Core mechanism: A mental state is conscious when it is the target of an appropriate higher-order representation (often associated with PFC or temporo-parietal association cortex).
- Phenomenal vs access: P-consciousness requires higher-order representations; metacognitive access and confidence depend on prefrontal systems.
- Key anatomical players: anterior PFC, medial PFC, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ); networks supporting metacognition and self-models.
- Signatures: Dissociations where first-order performance is intact but metacognition and subjective awareness ratings degrade with PFC disruption.

5) Predictive Processing / Active Inference accounts (PP/AI)
- Core mechanism: Conscious contents reflect precision-weighted prediction error dynamics in hierarchies; top-down predictions and their precision (gain control) shape awareness; deep apical dendrites and thalamo-cortical loops implement precision control.
- Phenomenal vs access: Phenomenal correlates with precise, self-consistent predictions at intermediate levels; access reflects high-level, report-related policies integrating those predictions.
- Key anatomical players: hierarchical cortical networks with laminar-specific feedforward/feedback; thalamus as precision/relay modulator; neuromodulatory systems (ACh, NE) set precision.
- Signatures: Consciousness depends on intact feedback and precision; anesthesia/sedation reduce top-down effective connectivity and cross-frequency coupling.

6) Attention Schema Theory (AST)
- Core mechanism: The brain builds a simplified model (“attention schema”) of its own attention; access and the subjective feeling of awareness arise from this model.
- Phenomenal vs access: Often unified—awareness is the content of the internal model; TPJ and related circuitry maintain the schema.
- Predictions: Distortions of awareness with TPJ lesions; attention manipulations alter awareness via schema updates.

Related mechanistic motifs across theories
- Thalamo-cortical loops: Arousal and gating (central thalamus, intralaminar nuclei, pulvinar) are necessary scaffolds for content-specific cortical interactions.
- Dendritic integration: Apical amplification in pyramidal neurons can multiplicatively gate top-down with bottom-up signals—plausible micro-mechanism for conscious access and report.
- Oscillatory coupling: Feedback often in alpha/beta; feedforward in gamma; cross-frequency coupling supports integration.

Interventions: predictions and best-supported findings

A) General anesthesia (propofol, sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine; dissociative ketamine)
- Key empirical regularities
  - TMS–EEG perturbational complexity (PCI) and related measures drop markedly during propofol/dexmedetomidine anesthesia and NREM sleep, and recover in REM and during ketamine with vivid mentation. Perturbations remain local and stereotyped under deep anesthesia; they are rich and propagating in wakefulness/REM.
  - Effective connectivity: reduced long-range, especially fronto-parietal feedback under GABAergic agents; preserved or altered patterns under ketamine.
  - Subjective content: vivid experience under ketamine despite reduced responsiveness; minimal or absent under propofol at adequate depth.

- GNWT predictions
  - Conscious access requires global ignition. Under propofol/dexmedetomidine, ignition and fronto-parietal effective connectivity collapse; P3b-like signatures vanish. Under ketamine, despite potential internal mentation, the necessary ignition for report is impaired; covert ignition may occur in associative networks without motor/report access.
  - Falsification risk: robust, content-specific global ignition with preserved fronto-parietal feedback during deep unresponsive propofol anesthesia would disconfirm GNWT.

- IIT predictions
  - Level tracks Φ/complexity: PCI and related complexity measures should fall with propofol/sevo; remain relatively higher in REM and ketamine. Contents depend on posterior hot zone integrity; PFC involvement not necessary.
  - Falsification risk: high PCI with entirely absent experience reports in post-hoc awakenings (controlling for amnesia) or low PCI with vivid ongoing mentation (matched arousal) would challenge IIT’s mapping.

- RPT predictions
  - Anesthesia disrupts recurrent processing in sensory cortex; even if early feedforward sweeps persist, feedback loops should be weakened, abolishing P-consciousness. Ketamine may spare or alter feedback enough to permit internally generated recurrence (dreamlike phenomenology).
  - Falsification risk: preserved local recurrent activity (laminar feedback) in sensory cortex with absent phenomenology, or absent local recurrence with preserved phenomenology.

- HOT predictions
  - Disruption of higher-order representations (via PFC suppression) removes consciousness despite preserved first-order processing. Ketamine may degrade higher-order coherence less, allowing phenomenology without access.
  - Falsification risk: strong PFC disruption with preserved metacognition and awareness; or PFC-intact states with reliably absent awareness despite intact arousal and sensory loops.

- PP/AI predictions
  - Anesthetics reduce top-down precision and feedback gain; propofol reduces fronto-parietal feedback and cross-frequency coupling; ketamine induces dysregulated precision with internally generated hypotheses causing vivid imagery.
  - Falsification risk: intact feedback and precision markers yet absent phenomenology; or severely suppressed feedback with robust phenomenology.

B) Sleep (NREM vs REM; dreaming)
- Key empirical regularities
  - REM: high cortical activation, vivid dream phenomenology; PCI closer to wakefulness.
  - NREM: lower PCI; yet dreaming can occur and is predicted by activation in a posterior “hot zone” across sleep stages; targeted awakenings show posterior activation predicts reports of ongoing experience.

- GNWT
  - REM may permit widespread ignition for internally generated content; NREM reduces ignition. Dream reports reflect internal broadcasts without external input. No sustained P3b is expected without task/report.
  - Falsification risk: sustained, widespread ignition in NREM without dream phenomenology; or absence of wide broadcasting in REM despite vivid dreams when measured with appropriate probes.

- IIT
  - Higher Φ/PCI in REM; localized posterior activation predicts dream contents even in NREM; posterior hot zone suffices.
  - Falsification risk: vivid dreams without elevated posterior integration or with frontal-only correlates in high-resolution data.

- RPT
  - Phenomenology tracks recurrent activity in sensory/posterior cortex; REM and dreamful NREM should show reinstated feedback there.
  - Falsification risk: dream phenomenology with purely feedforward signatures or without posterior recurrence.

- HOT
  - Reduced PFC activity during REM suggests altered metacognition; subjects typically have low insight in dreams. P-consciousness still possible if some higher-order representation persists in non-prefrontal networks.
  - Falsification risk: dreams requiring robust PFC-dependent metacognition under conditions where PFC is demonstrably quiescent.

- PP/AI
  - Internally generated predictions dominate when sensory precision is low; REM hallucinates due to high internal precision; NREM dreaming arises when posterior precision transiently increases.
  - Falsification risk: high sensory precision markers during REM; no posterior precision increases during dreamful NREM.

C) Visual masking and “no-report” paradigms
- Key empirical regularities
  - Backward masking and CFS can preserve early feedforward responses while abolishing awareness; TMS to early visual cortex around 80–120 ms can selectively disrupt awareness.
  - Event-related potentials: an earlier negativity (VAN ~200 ms) relates to awareness even without report, while P3b often disappears in no-report paradigms—suggesting P3b reflects task/report, not phenomenology.

- GNWT
  - Conscious access requires late ignition; masking prevents ignition. In no-report, P3b may disappear, but decodable widespread states could still emerge if content is consciously accessed without overt report (GNWT emphasizes the act of making information globally available, not motor report).
  - Falsification risk: Strong awareness with no evidence of late global broadcasting across fronto-parietal networks (beyond sensory and parietal areas), repeatedly across tasks.

- IIT
  - Masking truncates integration; posterior hot zone fails to reach integrated conceptual structures; PFC involvement unnecessary. VAN without P3b is compatible with phenomenology.
  - Falsification risk: Robust awareness with no increase in posterior integration (e.g., laminar feedback) and with purely frontal signatures.

- RPT
  - Awareness is lost because masking blocks recurrent processing; VAN should track awareness; P3b reflects access/report.
  - Falsification risk: Masked stimuli becoming conscious without recurrent/feedback signatures; or recurrent signatures present while subjects lack any awareness (in no-report designs with post-hoc confidence).

- HOT
  - Awareness depends on higher-order representation; masking prevents formation of higher-order states. Disruption to PFC/TPJ reduces subjective awareness and metacognitive sensitivity even when first-order performance persists.
  - Falsification risk: Strong subjective awareness and metacognition with PFC/TPJ disrupted and no compensatory higher-order coding elsewhere.

- PP/AI
  - Masking degrades precision of prediction errors, suppressing belief updates needed for conscious attribution to causes; expectations can rescue awareness (e.g., priors increase detection).
  - Falsification risk: Large expectation/precision manipulations fail to modulate awareness in masking when neural precision markers change.

D) Focal lesions
- Key empirical regularities
  - Posterior cortical lesions cause specific losses of conscious content (e.g., achromatopsia, akinetopsia, prosopagnosia, visual neglect) and can abolish large swaths of experience (e.g., bilateral occipito-parietal damage).
  - Prefrontal lesions often spare basic conscious perception but degrade metacognition, confidence calibration, and flexible report; bilateral massive PFC damage does not invariably abolish wakeful consciousness, though it can affect goal-directed access and self-monitoring.

- GNWT
  - Widespread fronto-parietal damage should degrade access; if posterior cortex intact, some phenomenology can persist but access/maintained ignition may be compromised. Extensive PFC damage should impair flexible reporting and multi-domain broadcasting.
  - Falsification risk: Normal access/report with extensive bilateral fronto-parietal lesions; or complete loss of phenomenology with intact fronto-parietal networks but posterior lesion sparing.

- IIT
  - Posterior hot zone lesions should selectively abolish corresponding contents; PFC lesions should not abolish phenomenology per se. Claustrum and thalamus affect level/arousal but not specific content mapping.
  - Falsification risk: Isolated PFC lesions abolish phenomenology wholesale despite posterior integrity; posterior lesions leave phenomenology intact while only impairing report.

- RPT
  - Lesions disrupting local recurrence in sensory cortex eliminate corresponding phenomenology; PFC lesions spare phenomenology but impair access/metacognition.
  - Falsification risk: Preserved phenomenology after lesions that abolish recurrent loops; or losses of phenomenology with spared recurrent circuits.

- HOT
  - Bilateral PFC lesions should markedly reduce or eliminate consciousness if higher-order representations cannot form; partial lesions degrade metacognition/awareness ratings more than first-order discrimination.
  - Falsification risk: Intact subjective awareness and metacognition after targeted PFC lesions with no evidence of compensatory HOT representations elsewhere.

- PP/AI
  - Lesions that disrupt feedback/precision control (posterior or thalamic) degrade phenomenology; PFC lesions impair policies for report and meta-level inference; posterior lesions specifically remove content-generating hierarchies.
  - Falsification risk: Normal awareness despite disrupted feedback/precision markers; loss of awareness with preserved feedback/precision.

E) Causal stimulation (TMS, intracranial stimulation, DBS)
- Key empirical regularities
  - TMS–EEG PCI: brief frontal TMS in wakefulness elicits complex, long-lasting spatiotemporal patterns that collapse to local, stereotyped responses in NREM/anesthesia; PCI correlates with capacity for consciousness across conditions (coma, sleep, anesthesia, REM).
  - Intracranial stimulation of posterior temporal/occipital cortex often elicits vivid content (faces from FFA, motion from MT+, colors, scenes); stimulation of lateral PFC less often yields specific qualia, tending to produce thoughts, urges, or task set changes.
  - Frontal eye field (FEF) stimulation biases attention and detection thresholds but rarely generates contentful qualia by itself.
  - Central thalamus DBS can restore responsiveness and purposeful behavior in disorders of consciousness; claustrum/pulvinar stimulation modulates arousal/attention; one reported case of claustrum stimulation transiently suppressing consciousness (later works suggest network effects).

- GNWT
  - Direct stimulation that triggers wide fronto-parietal ignition should induce conscious access; TMS that fails to propagate globally should not. Stimulation effects should scale with effective connectivity into workspace hubs.
  - Falsification risk: Repeated induction of vivid, reportable content by strictly posterior stimulation without any measurable global ignition; or induction of rich content by stimulating PFC in isolation without posterior involvement.

- IIT
  - Stimulation of posterior hot zone should reliably change phenomenology; PCI should predict capacity across states; fronto-parietal stimulation not necessary for content and often insufficient to evoke it.
  - Falsification risk: Robust, content-rich experiences reliably induced by isolated PFC stimulation while posterior cortex is offline; PCI failing to track capacity across many matched conditions.

- RPT
  - Disrupting feedback to sensory cortices (timed TMS) abolishes awareness; enhancing local recurrence should boost it. Laminar-specific perturbations that block feedback to superficial layers should remove phenomenology.
  - Falsification risk: Contentful experiences induced without recurrent signatures; or lack of awareness change despite strong laminar feedback disruption.

- HOT
  - Increasing higher-order representation (via PFC stimulation) should increase awareness and metacognitive confidence even without sensory changes; posterior stimulation without higher-order representation may not produce “awareness” as reported.
  - Falsification risk: PFC stimulation consistently fails to modulate awareness/metacognition while posterior stimulation does, even when higher-order markers are unaltered.

- PP/AI
  - Manipulating precision (via neuromodulation or targeted stimulation) should change awareness; thalamic/pulvinar stimulation should gate cortico-cortical coupling and awareness; oscillatory signatures (alpha/beta feedback, gamma feedforward) and cross-frequency coupling should change with percepts.
  - Falsification risk: Precision/feedback measures change without awareness changes, or awareness changes without corresponding precision/feedback signatures.

How to adjudicate between theories: decisive tests
- Posterior vs frontal necessity and sufficiency
  - Necessary: Show that selective inactivation of posterior hot zone abolishes corresponding phenomenology while PFC is intact; show that selective PFC inactivation eliminates phenomenology with intact posterior cortex (HOT/GNWT would predict stronger frontal necessity than IIT/RPT).
  - Sufficient: Repeatedly induce vivid, content-specific experiences by stimulating posterior cortex without frontal ignition (supports IIT/RPT); conversely, induce contentful experiences by stimulating PFC alone (supports HOT/GNWT). So far, posterior sufficiency has stronger support.

- No-report, high-resolution causal timing
  - Use laminar ECoG/MEG to determine whether superficial-layer feedback in sensory cortex is necessary for awareness (supports RPT/PP).
  - Demonstrate conscious perception with purely feedforward signatures and no posterior feedback (would challenge RPT/IIT/PP).

- Complexity and capacity
  - Across matched arousal conditions, test whether PCI (or related integration measures) tracks capacity for experiencing in individuals who later provide careful reports (e.g., REM vs NREM awakenings; ketamine vs propofol).
  - Strong divergence (e.g., high PCI but reliable absence of experiences) would challenge IIT’s mapping and any theory tying capacity to integration/complexity.

- Prefrontal lesions and metacognition
  - Preregistered tests of subjective awareness and meta-d’ in patients with focal PFC lesions: if P-consciousness is preserved but metacognition impaired, supports RPT/IIT distinction between phenomenology and access; if awareness ratings themselves collapse independent of report/decision demands, supports HOT/GNWT.

- Receptor-specific anesthesia
  - Compare propofol, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, sevoflurane with identical behavioral endpoints to see whether theories correctly predict patterns in feedback connectivity, PCI, and subjective mentation (e.g., ketamine preserving complexity and phenomenology).

Assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations
- Operationalizing phenomenal consciousness: No-report paradigms reduce confounds but do not eliminate all inference pitfalls (e.g., memory, criterion, covert response preparation).
- PCI and Φ: PCI is a practical perturbational measure of spatiotemporal complexity, not Φ itself; dissociations are possible and would need careful interpretation.
- Heterogeneity of PFC: “PFC” is not monolithic; different subregions may support different higher-order or workspace functions. Sparse PFC stimulation data may under-detect contentful experiences due to stimulation parameters.
- Anesthesia heterogeneity: Agents differ pharmacodynamically; “unconsciousness” is not unitary across drugs.
- Species and methods: Laminar recordings, optogenetics, and microstimulation evidence in animals must be carefully extrapolated to humans.

Bottom line
- Convergences: Consciousness requires more than feedforward sweep—recurrent/feedback and integration matter; arousal systems (thalamus/brainstem) are necessary scaffolds; posterior cortex is central for specific contents; P3b is tied to access/report rather than phenomenology.
- Key disagreements with falsifiable predictions:
  - Is PFC necessary for phenomenology? IIT/RPT say no; HOT/GNWT assign a stronger role (with GNWT linking access to PFC-parietal ignition).
  - Are posterior local recurrent loops sufficient for phenomenology? RPT/IIT say yes; GNWT/HOT say not without higher-order/global broadcast.
  - Do integration/complexity measures track capacity across states (IIT-style) beyond task confounds? Evidence broadly supportive, but not definitive.
- Most decisive future tests combine: targeted, laminar-specific perturbations; no-report paradigms; receptor-specific anesthesia; causal network metrics; and preregistered adversarial predictions distinguishing posterior sufficiency from frontal necessity.
