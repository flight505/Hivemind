PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 39
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total expenditures (500-1500) and balanced spending distribution (no single amenity exceeding 35% of total) show increased transport probability, particularly for ages 18-40

2. CryoSleep-enabled passengers on deck G traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate reduced transport probability regardless of expenditure status, while those on deck F maintain high transport rates

3. VIP status modifies transport probability for moderate spenders (1000-3000 total expenditures): VIP passengers show increased transport rates compared to non-VIPs at similar spending levels across all destinations

4. Passengers with missing expenditure data (â‰¥3 NaN values) demonstrate destination-dependent patterns: Europa-origin passengers show elevated transport probability, while Earth-origin passengers show reduced probability

5. Concentrated spending thresholds modified: Single-amenity spending exceeding 40% of total (rather than 60%) correlates with reduced transport probability, particularly for Spa and VRDeck expenditures

6. Age-based exceptions for CryoSleep passengers: Children aged 0-12 in CryoSleep maintain high transport probability regardless of destination, while teens aged 13-17 show variable patterns based on expenditure levels

7. Earth-origin passengers aged 18-25 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with low-moderate spending (200-800) show significantly elevated transport probability, particularly when spending is distributed across multiple amenities

8. Cabin deck B passengers demonstrate consistently high transport rates across all destinations regardless of expenditure patterns, with the exception of 55 Cancri e where age-based filters apply

9. Missing destination data correlates with specific home planet patterns: Mars-origin passengers with missing destination show elevated transport probability, while Earth-origin passengers show reduced probability

10. Group size modifiers strengthened: Pairs traveling together show >80% transport consistency when both passengers have similar expenditure patterns and age ranges (within 10 years)
