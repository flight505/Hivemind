PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 45
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22 where transport probability decreases significantly regardless of other factors

2. Earth-origin passengers with any spending activity (>0 total) show reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, overriding previous Earth-origin elevation patterns

3. Passengers aged 13-17 with CryoSleep enabled show variable transport patterns based on destination: reduced probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers but maintained high probability for 55 Cancri e travelers

4. Missing expenditure data combined with Earth origin indicates lower transport probability across all destinations, while Europa-origin passengers with missing expenditures maintain higher transport likelihood

5. Moderate spending (500-1500 total) Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate significantly reduced transport probability, requiring lower spending thresholds than previously established

6. Passengers with concentrated spending in单一 amenity (exceeding 70% of total spending) show further reduced transport probability, with strongest effect for Spa and VRDeck expenditures

7. PSO J318.5-22 destination passengers require additional scrutiny: CryoSleep status alone becomes less predictive, requiring consideration of age and expenditure patterns

8. Cabin deck G passengers show destination-dependent transport patterns: reduced probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers regardless of other factors, but maintained probability for 55 Cancri e travelers

9. Passengers with completely zero expenditures but missing CryoSleep status data demonstrate lower transport probability, particularly for Earth-origin and TRAPPIST-1e travelers

10. Age thresholds adjust for intermediate ranges: 20-30 year olds show elevated transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e with low spending, while 30-45 year olds show reduced probability for 55 Cancri e regardless of spending

11. Group size patterns strengthen: pairs (group size 2) show more consistent transport outcomes when both members share similar age and expenditure characteristics

12. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for TRAPPIST-1e travelers, where VIPs show 25% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts with similar spending patterns
