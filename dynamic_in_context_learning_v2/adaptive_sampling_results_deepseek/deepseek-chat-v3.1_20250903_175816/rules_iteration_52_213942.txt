PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 52
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported for destination TRAPPIST-1e, but have reduced transport probability for destinations 55 Cancri e and PSO J318.5-22. For 55 Cancri e, children under 13 with CryoSleep and zero spending have further reduced probability.

2. For destination TRAPPIST-1e, passengers with total expenditures less than 3000 have high transport probability, and spending thresholds for reduced probability are elevated: non-VIP expenditures between 500-3000 do not reduce transport probability, while above 3000 may reduce it. VIP passengers have higher thresholds (e.g., 2500-6000).

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates for TRAPPIST-1e even with moderate spending (500-1500), and the high spending exception is only for expenditures >1500 for TRAPPIST-1e.

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures and CryoSleep disabled have low transport probability for all destinations.

5. Passengers with missing HomePlanet data show increased transport probability, especially when accompanied by low to moderate spending patterns.

6. For destination PSO J318.5-22, CryoSleep enabled with zero expenditures indicates low transport probability.

7. Concentrated spending in one amenity reduces transport probability less for destination TRAPPIST-1e compared to other destinations.

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) have high transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e with low spending (<800), but for 55 Cancri e, transport probability is lower regardless of spending.

9. VIP status modifies transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show lower transport rates.

10. Group transport consistency is strong for groups of 3+ members, but for pairs, transport outcome depends on age composition and spending similarity.
