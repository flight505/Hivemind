PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 60
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total expenditures (500-2000) maintain elevated transport probability, regardless of specific spending distribution across amenities

2. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures across all amenities show significantly higher transport probability, especially when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e from Earth or Mars

3. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures remain highly likely transported to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of home planet

4. Missing expenditure data (multiple NaN values) combined with TRAPPIST-1e destination indicates higher transport probability for all home planets

5. Cabin deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show increased transport probability when combined with Earth origin and moderate-low spending (<1000 total)

6. Intermediate age ranges (20-50) with TRAPPIST-1e destination and low-moderate spending (200-1500 total) demonstrate elevated transport probability from Earth origin

7. Expenditure concentration patterns modified: Moderate spending distributed across 2-3 amenities (no single category exceeding 50% of total) correlates with increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e

8. Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures below 800 maintain high transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of home planet

9. Missing cabin data combined with TRAPPIST-1e destination and zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability

10. Teen passengers (13-19) with zero expenditures show elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e, contradicting previous child-specific rules
