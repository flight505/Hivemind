PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 31
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures remain transported except Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e aged 20-40, who show reduced transport probability regardless of VIP status

2. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total spending (200-1500) and concentrated VRDeck/Spa expenditure (>60% of total) demonstrate significantly reduced transport probability

3. Europa-origin passengers with high total expenditures (>3000) show elevated transport probability across all destinations, particularly when spending is distributed across multiple amenities

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity (≥1) maintain reduced transport probability, except when traveling in groups of 3+ with consistent family transport patterns

5. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport rates, while deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show further reduced transport probability when combined with Earth origin and age 25-45

6. Missing expenditure patterns correlate strongly with transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but significantly lower probability for Earth-origin passengers to any destination

7. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show destination-dependent reversal: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low-moderate spending (<800), but significantly lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending or VIP status

8. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers aged 30-50 traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 60% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts

9. Concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 70% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to all destinations

10. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >95% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition and destination alignment

11. Mars-origin passengers with moderate spending (500-2000) and cabin decks E/F demonstrate elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, but reduced probability to 55 Cancri e

12. Passengers with completely missing cabin information show destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers, lower for 55 Cancri e travelers

13. Young adults (18-25) with balanced spending across amenities (no single category >50% of total) show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e but decreased probability to 55 Cancri e

14. Earth-origin passengers with missing age data and any spending activity demonstrate reduced transport probability across all destinations

15. VIP passengers with high Spa expenditures (>1000) show reduced transport probability regardless of destination or home planet
