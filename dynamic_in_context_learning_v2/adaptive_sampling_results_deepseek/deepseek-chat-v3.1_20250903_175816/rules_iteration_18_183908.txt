PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability except: children under 13 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport rates, and passengers to PSO J318.5-22 require additional age verification (over 18 for full transport probability)

2. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates that persist even with moderate spending (500-2000 total) when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, with reduced transport probability only applying above 2000 total expenditure

3. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers to all destinations, but requires destination-specific verification for Earth-origin passengers

4. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures show variable transport patterns based on destination: higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e, and neutral for PSO J318.5-22

5. Spending concentration thresholds modified: more than 70% of total spending in any single amenity (particularly Spa or ShoppingMall) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations

6. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show enhanced transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with spending under 1000, while maintaining reduced probability for 55 Cancri e regardless of spending levels

7. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport rates even with moderate spending (up to 1500), while deck G passengers show reduced transport probability only for 55 Cancri e destination

8. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size but requires age composition adjustment: groups containing children under 13 show lower same-transport probability (70-80%) compared to adult-only groups

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for 55 Cancri e travelers, where VIPs show 30% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all spending levels

10. Missing expenditure patterns require destination-specific interpretation: multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but require spending verification for Earth-origin passengers

11. Mars-origin passengers with high ShoppingMall expenditure (above 1000) show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, contrasting with general spending rules

12. Age-based exceptions for CryoSleep passengers: travelers over 50 with zero expenditures show slightly reduced transport probability regardless of destination
