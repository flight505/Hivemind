PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 7
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate significantly higher transport probability than other home planet combinations, even when controlling for spending patterns
2. Passengers under age 5 with zero expenditures across all amenities show elevated transport rates regardless of CryoSleep status or destination
3. Missing expenditure data patterns combined with Earth origin and TRAPPIST-1e destination correlate with higher transport probability, distinct from both zero-spending and normal-spending patterns
4. VIP passengers with moderate spending (100-2000 total across amenities) demonstrate reversed transport probability compared to non-VIP passengers with similar spending profiles
5. Group transport consistency strengthens for groups containing children under 13, with entire groups typically sharing transport outcomes when children are present
6. Europa-origin passengers on cabin decks B and C show elevated transport probability regardless of spending levels, particularly when traveling to 55 Cancri e
7. Passengers aged 18-25 with zero expenditures show variable transport patterns based on destination: higher for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e and PSO J318.5-22
8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) with missing CryoSleep data and Earth origin demonstrate transport probability patterns similar to CryoSleep-enabled passengers
9. Mars-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures show destination-dependent transport patterns: highest for TRAPPIST-1e, intermediate for 55 Cancri e, lowest for PSO J318.5-22
10. Elderly passengers (Age > 60) with any spending activity demonstrate significantly lower transport probability than younger passengers with similar spending patterns
11. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on spending levels, with lower spending thresholds for transport probability on deck G compared to deck F
12. Passengers with single missing expenditure values (particularly Spa or VRDeck) combined with Earth origin show transport patterns similar to zero-spenders rather than normal spenders
