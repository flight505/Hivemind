PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 11
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22 where transport probability is reduced, and for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e where transport probability is lower for ages under 20 or over 50.

2. For non-VIP passengers, moderate spending (500-3000 total) does not reduce transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e, but for VIP passengers, high spending (>2000) reduces transport probability across all destinations.

3. Earth-origin passengers have elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e even with spending up to 3000, and to 55 Cancri e with spending up to 2000.

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero spending show high transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e where probability is lower.

5. Cabin decks G and F show higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with spending, while Deck G to 55 Cancri e has reduced probability only with high spending.

6. Missing expenditure data: For Earth-origin, multiple NaN values indicate lower transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, but for Europa, indicate higher probability to TRAPPIST-1e.

7. Group transport consistency: Groups of 2+ members show high same-transport outcome if age composition is similar, especially for children with zero spending.

8. Intermediate age ranges (20-50) demonstrate high transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low spending (<1000), but for 55 Cancri e, spending patterns matter more with reduced probability for high spending.

9. VIP status reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers with high spending (>1500) to any destination, but has minimal effect for non-Earth origins.

10. Expenditure distribution: Concentrated spending in a single amenity (exceeding 60% of total) does not reduce transport probability for non-VIP passengers to TRAPPIST-1e, but reduces for VIP passengers and other destinations.
