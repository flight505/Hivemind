PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 55
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with any expenditure activity (total > 0) and CryoSleep enabled show significantly reduced transport probability across all destinations and demographics

2. Children aged 0-12 demonstrate near-zero transport probability regardless of spending or CryoSleep status when traveling without family groups

3. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures exceeding 800 show sharply reduced transport probability, with the effect strengthening above 1500 total spending

4. Missing expenditure data combined with CryoSleep status requires destination-specific interpretation: Europa-origin passengers with multiple NaN values maintain high transport probability while Earth-origin passengers show reduced likelihood

5. Cabin decks F and G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e require additional spending-based filters: Moderate spending (300-1200) reduces transport probability, particularly for deck G occupants

6. Passengers aged 20-50 with concentrated spending in any single amenity exceeding 40% of total expenditures show reduced transport probability across all destinations

7. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers, where VIPs show 35% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts at moderate spending levels

8. Groups showing expenditure disparity (>500 difference between members) demonstrate reduced transport consistency, overriding family size patterns

9. Intermediate age ranges (18-35) with zero expenditures but disabled CryoSleep show elevated transport probability only for Europa-origin passengers

10. Missing cabin data combined with any expenditure activity indicates significantly reduced transport probability across all origins and destinations

11. Passengers with total expenditures between 200-800 show destination-dependent patterns: Reduced transport for TRAPPIST-1e travelers but maintained probability for 55 Cancri e travelers

12. Infants (age 0) with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures maintain high transport probability regardless of destination or origin planet
