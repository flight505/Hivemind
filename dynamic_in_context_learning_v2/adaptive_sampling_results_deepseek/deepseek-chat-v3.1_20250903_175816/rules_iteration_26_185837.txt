PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 26
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, but Mars-origin passengers in CryoSleep show reduced transport probability across all destinations (particularly TRAPPIST-1e)

2. Moderate spending thresholds vary by origin planet: Earth-origin passengers with total expenditures 500-2500 maintain elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e, while Europa-origin passengers with spending above 2000 show significantly increased transport probability

3. Infants (age 0) with zero expenditures demonstrate near-universal transport regardless of origin planet or destination, overriding other predictive factors

4. Cabin deck patterns show enhanced transport probability for Deck B and C passengers from Europa to TRAPPIST-1e, while Deck F passengers from Earth maintain elevated transport rates except when accompanied by concentrated Spa/VRDeck spending

5. Partial expenditure missingness (1-2 NaN values) correlates with higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e, while complete expenditure missingness indicates reduced transport likelihood

6. Age-based transport patterns extend beyond childhood: passengers aged 45+ from Earth show elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e when accompanied by low-moderate spending (<1000 total)

7. VIP status significantly increases transport probability for Europa-origin passengers to all destinations, while reducing transport likelihood for Mars-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e

8. Concentrated spending patterns show destination-specific effects: High FoodCourt expenditure (>1500) increases transport probability for Europa-origin passengers, while similar Spa expenditure reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers

9. Intermediate age ranges (18-25) demonstrate elevated transport rates for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e when combined with moderate, distributed spending patterns (200-800 total across multiple amenities)

10. Passengers with completely missing cabin data but valid expenditures show reduced transport probability across all origin-destination combinations, except for Europa-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e
