PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 38
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures show significantly reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e and PSO J318.5-22 destinations, regardless of age or cabin location

2. Missing expenditure values (NaN) in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall specifically indicate reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations, while multiple missing expenditure values increase transport probability for Europa-origin passengers

3. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures below 800 show elevated transport probability regardless of age, except when spending is concentrated in a single amenity category exceeding 60% of total

4. Passengers aged 18-35 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total spending (100-1500) demonstrate consistently reduced transport probability, particularly when spending is distributed across multiple amenities

5. Missing cabin data combined with zero expenditures indicates reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations, while the same pattern indicates increased transport probability for Mars-origin passengers

6. Passengers with concentrated spending in VRDeck exceeding 50% of total expenditures show reduced transport probability across all destinations and age groups

7. Group size effects are destination-dependent: pairs and singles show reduced transport probability to 55 Cancri e when accompanied by any expenditure activity, while larger groups maintain consistent transport outcomes

8. Intermediate age ranges (20-40) demonstrate consistently reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e when combined with any FoodCourt spending activity

9. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e

10. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on spending patterns: Deck F passengers with any Spa spending have reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, while Deck G passengers with zero expenditures have increased transport probability to 55 Cancri e
