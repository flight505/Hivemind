PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly for ages under 50, counter to the general CryoSleep transport pattern

2. Infants (age 0) with zero expenditures demonstrate elevated transport rates regardless of CryoSleep status when traveling to 55 Cancri e, overriding typical age-based spending rules

3. Mars-origin passengers with any spending activity (>0) show reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, with this effect strengthening for passengers under age 25

4. Multiple missing expenditure values (â‰¥3 NaN amenities) combined with Earth origin strongly indicates reduced transport probability across all destinations

5. Passengers with concentrated spending in VRDeck (>80% of total expenditures) show significantly reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

6. Cabin deck G passengers with zero expenditures demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: elevated for 55 Cancri e but reduced for TRAPPIST-1e

7. Europa-origin passengers in CryoSleep show consistently high transport rates (>90%) regardless of age or destination, with exceptions only for extreme spending outliers

8. Moderate spending ranges (500-2000 total) reduce transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, but increase probability for Europa-origin passengers to the same destination

9. Missing HomePlanet data combined with CryoSleep status indicates high transport probability (>85%) regardless of other factors

10. Passengers aged 13-17 with any Spa expenditures (>0) show reduced transport probability when traveling to PSO J318.5-22, overriding general age spending patterns

11. VIP status reverses typical Earth-origin transport patterns for 55 Cancri e travelers: VIPs show elevated transport rates while non-VIPs show reduced probability

12. Single-amenity spending concentration (>70% in one category) combined with Mars origin indicates reduced transport probability across all destinations except 55 Cancri e

13. Cabin decks A-C passengers demonstrate consistently high transport rates (>80%) when combined with Europa origin, regardless of spending patterns or CryoSleep status

14. Missing destination data correlates with reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers with any spending activity, but elevated probability for Europa-origin passengers with zero spending

15. Group size modifies age effects: children (0-12) in groups of 3+ show elevated transport probability even with spending activity, while solitary children maintain reduced transport likelihood
