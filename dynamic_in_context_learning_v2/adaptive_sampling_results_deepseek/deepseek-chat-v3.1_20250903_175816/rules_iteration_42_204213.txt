PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 42
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported, with reduced probability only for children under 13 traveling to 55 Cancri e.

2. Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures greater than 2500 show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, while expenditures between 500-2500 may reduce probability depending on destination. VIP passengers with expenditures greater than 5000 show increased probability to TRAPPIST-1e, and 2000-5000 may reduce probability.

3. Earth-origin passengers have elevated transport rates, but high spending (>1500 total) or travel to 55 Cancri e reduces this. Mars and Europa origins show higher transport probability with high spending to TRAPPIST-1e.

4. Cabin deck F to TRAPPIST-1e correlates with high transport rates. Deck G to 55 Cancri e correlates with reduced rates, while to TRAPPIST-1e, it indicates elevated rates.

5. Missing expenditure data: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower for Earth-origin passengers, with destination-specific variations.

6. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity (â‰¥1 across amenities) have reduced transport probability, but with zero expenditures, probability is high if CryoSleep is enabled or destination is TRAPPIST-1e.

7. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with low-moderate spending (<800) have higher transport probability, while to 55 Cancri e, spending has minimal effect on probability.

8. VIP status reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e compared to non-VIPs.

9. Concentrated spending in a single amenity (exceeding 60% of total) reduces transport probability for destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e.

10. Group transport consistency remains high for families of 3+ members, with over 90% same-transport outcome, while pairs depend on age composition and spending.
