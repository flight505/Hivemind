PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 56
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Young passengers (age 0-12) with zero expenditures across all amenities show high transport probability regardless of destination, modifying previous age-based spending restrictions

2. Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate elevated transport rates even with moderate total spending (500-2000 range), overriding previous high-spending exclusion rules for this destination

3. Moderate spending thresholds vary by destination: TRAPPIST-1e travelers show increased transport probability with spending up to 2500, while 55 Cancri e travelers maintain lower spending thresholds (below 1000) for transport likelihood

4. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for Mars-origin passengers across all destinations

5. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show significantly elevated transport rates regardless of spending patterns or home planet

6. Low-age passengers (0-6) with any missing expenditure data (â‰¥2 NaN values) demonstrate near-certain transport probability across all destinations and home planets

7. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show destination-dependent transport patterns: high probability for TRAPPIST-1e but reduced probability for 55 Cancri e

8. Intermediate age range (20-35) with balanced spending distribution (no single amenity exceeding 40% of total) shows elevated transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e destination

9. Mars-origin passengers with high concentrated spending in ShoppingMall (>60% of total) demonstrate increased transport probability to 55 Cancri e

10. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data (all amenities NaN) show planet-specific transport patterns: high for Europa, moderate for Mars, low for Earth

11. Group members (same last name and cabin section) with uniform zero expenditures show >95% transport consistency regardless of other factors

12. VIP status significantly reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e when combined with moderate spending (500-1500 range)
