PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 32
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability when traveling to PSO J318.5-22, particularly for Earth-origin passengers aged 40+

2. Europa-origin passengers with moderate-high total spending (1000-5000) and missing VIP data demonstrate elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e

3. Children aged 0-2 with zero expenditures show significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, except when traveling with family groups of 3+

4. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures demonstrate variable transport outcomes based on cabin deck: Deck G passengers show reduced probability while Deck F passengers maintain high transport rates

5. Missing expenditure data combined with single-category spending concentration (>70% of total) indicates higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower for Earth-origin passengers

6. Passengers aged 25-45 with low-moderate spending (100-800) show elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e but reduced probability to 55 Cancri e, with Earth-origin passengers showing strongest pattern

7. Cabin deck G passengers demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: reduced probability for 55 Cancri e regardless of spending, but maintained probability for TRAPPIST-1e with zero expenditures

8. Moderate spending (500-1500) combined with missing VIP status correlates with increased transport probability for Europa-origin passengers to all destinations

9. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data (all amenities NaN) show reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers but elevated probability for Mars-origin passengers

10. Age 12-18 passengers with any spending activity (â‰¥1) show reduced transport probability except when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with family groups

11. Destination PSO J318.5-22 requires additional filters for CryoSleep passengers: reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers aged 30+ even with zero expenditures

12. Expenditure distribution patterns modified: concentrated spending in ShoppingMall or FoodCourt (exceeding 60% of total) correlates with increased transport probability for Europa-origin passengers

13. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for Mars-origin passengers but lower for Earth-origin passengers

14. Group transport consistency strengthened for pairs when both passengers are under age 15, showing >85% same-transport outcome regardless of spending patterns

15. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for 55 Cancri e travelers: VIPs show 30% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all spending levels
