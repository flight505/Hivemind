PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 50
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22 where transport probability decreases significantly regardless of other factors

2. Moderate spending thresholds vary by VIP status and destination: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 500-3000 show reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2000-6000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood to 55 Cancri e

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when accompanied by high spending patterns (>2000 total) or travel to 55 Cancri e destination, with additional reduction for those aged 25-45

4. Passengers aged 0-18 with any spending activity (≥1 across amenities) show significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, particularly when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

5. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on destination and spending: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with low spending (<500) have higher transport rates, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e with any spending show reduced transport probability

6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with destination-specific transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers, especially when traveling to PSO J318.5-22

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 4+ members show >95% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition and destination

8. Intermediate age ranges (20-40) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low spending (<500), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with any spending activity

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, where VIPs show 35% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts with similar spending patterns

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa or ShoppingMall exceeding 70% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations, especially for Earth-origin passengers

11. Passengers with completely missing cabin information show reduced transport probability when combined with any spending activity, regardless of destination

12. Young adults (18-25) with moderate total spending (300-1500) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show increased transport probability, except when from Earth origin

13. Europa-origin passengers with high FoodCourt spending (>1000) demonstrate elevated transport rates to all destinations except 55 Cancri e

14. Mars-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show near-certain transport regardless of destination, with exception for those traveling to PSO J318.5-22

15. Passengers with missing age data combined with any spending activity show reduced transport probability, particularly when from Earth origin
