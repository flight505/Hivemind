PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers with moderate total spending (500-2500 across amenities) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show elevated transport probability, especially when expenditures are concentrated in FoodCourt or Spa
2. Passengers aged 18-30 with CryoSleep disabled and low-to-moderate spending (100-1500 total) demonstrate higher transport rates than previously estimated, particularly on TRAPPIST-1e routes
3. Missing expenditure patterns (NaN values) combined with Earth origin and TRAPPIST-1e destination indicate increased transport likelihood compared to zero-spending patterns
4. Cabin decks F and G show differentiated transport patterns based on spending behavior: F-deck passengers with balanced spending across amenities have higher transport rates, while G-deck requires stricter spending thresholds
5. Group transport consistency strengthens when members share identical Cabin deck and spending patterns (zero vs non-zero), overriding individual age or spending variations within the group
6. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled but age >40 demonstrate significantly lower transport probability than younger cryosleep passengers, particularly when traveling to 55 Cancri e
7. Moderate spending on FoodCourt (500-1500) combined with low other expenditures (<200) correlates with higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations
8. Missing HomePlanet data combined with CryoSleep enabled indicates lower transport probability than other cryosleep passengers, requiring separate classification
9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for passengers with high total spending (>3000), where VIPs show lower transport rates than non-VIPs with similar expenditure
10. Transport probability for Europa-origin passengers peaks at intermediate spending levels (1000-4000) rather than following the typical inverse spending relationship observed for Earth passengers
