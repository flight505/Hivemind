PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 12
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures show elevated transport probability, except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22 where transport probability decreases significantly regardless of other factors
2. Young adult Earth-origin passengers (18-24) with moderate total spending (1000-3000) demonstrate higher transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, overriding standard spending-based reductions
3. Missing expenditure data significantly increases transport probability for Europa-origin passengers to all destinations, particularly when multiple amenities show NaN values
4. Children aged 0-4 with zero expenditures show unexpectedly high transport probability regardless of origin or destination, contrasting with older children
5. Concentrated spending threshold increases to 75% of total in单一 amenity before reducing transport probability, with Spa and VRDeck spending having strongest negative correlation
6. VIP status shows minimal impact on transport probability for most scenarios except Earth-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e, where it reduces probability by 50-60%
7. Cabin deck G passengers show reduced transport probability across all destinations except 55 Cancri e, where probability increases slightly
8. Young adults (18-25) with sparse but non-zero spending (1-100 total) demonstrate elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly Earth-origin passengers
9. Missing age data correlates with higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers
10. Group transport consistency strengthens to >95% same-transport outcome for groups of 4+ members, while pairs maintain more variable patterns based on age disparity
11. Intermediate age ranges (30-50) show destination-dependent reversal: higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e with high spending (>2000) but lower probability for 55 Cancri e with similar spending
12. Earth-origin passengers to PSO J318.5-22 demonstrate significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status or spending patterns
13. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for all origins except Earth
14. Very high expenditure outliers (>8000 total) show reduced transport probability across all origins and destinations, overriding other positive indicators
15. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show elevated transport probability only when combined with Earth origin and age 18-30
