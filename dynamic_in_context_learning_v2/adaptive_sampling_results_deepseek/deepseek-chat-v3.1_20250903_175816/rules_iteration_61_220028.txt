PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 61
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers bound for TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate elevated transport probability irrespective of moderate spending (0-2000 total), with exceptions only for extreme single-category expenditure concentrations exceeding 70% of total spending

2. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures across all amenities show significantly increased transport probability, reversing previous rule for this demographic

3. Intermediate spending ranges (500-2000 total) no longer automatically reduce transport probability for non-VIP passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, except when accompanied by concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 60% of total

4. Missing expenditure data patterns now show destination-specific correlations: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e but maintain lower probability for Earth-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e

5. Young adult passengers (17-25) with CryoSleep disabled and moderate balanced spending (200-1500 total) show elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly those from Earth origin

6. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain high transport probability regardless of spending patterns, while deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show further reduced transport rates

7. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers, where VIPs show 25% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all destinations

8. Expenditure distribution thresholds adjusted: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity now requires exceeding 70% of total spending (increased from 60%) to correlate with reduced transport probability

9. Group transport consistency strengthened for all group sizes >1, with same-transport outcomes exceeding 85% probability regardless of age composition

10. Missing age data correlates with higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers, independent of other factors

11. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show reversed destination patterns: Higher transport probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with low spending (<500), but lower probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with high spending (>1500)

12. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with minimal non-zero expenditures (<100 total) now maintain high transport probability across all destinations and age groups
