PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 25
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Mars-origin passengers with moderate total expenditures (500-2000) show increased transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, particularly when traveling to PSO J318.5-22

2. Earth-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled but zero expenditures demonstrate lower transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, requiring additional age verification (under 40 shows reduced transport likelihood)

3. Missing expenditure data combined with Earth origin indicates significantly reduced transport probability across all destinations, overriding other positive indicators

4. Intermediate age ranges (20-40) with concentrated spending in ShoppingMall (>60% of total expenditures) show reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e

5. Europa-origin passengers with high total expenditures (>3000) maintain high transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of other factors

6. Cabin deck F passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (200-800) show elevated transport probability, particularly from Mars origin

7. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data but valid CryoSleep=false status demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: higher for Europa, lower for Earth

8. Younger adults (18-25) with balanced spending distribution (<50% in any single amenity) show increased transport probability to all destinations except 55 Cancri e

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for high-spending Earth passengers (>1500 total), reducing transport likelihood by approximately 30%

10. Groups with mixed age compositions (containing both minors and adults) show reduced transport consistency, with probability decreasing as age range within group increases

11. Passengers with NaN in ShoppingMall but valid other expenditures show increased transport probability when from Europa origin traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

12. Elderly passengers (65+) with any expenditure activity demonstrate reduced transport probability across all destinations and origin planets

13. Cabin deck G passengers with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of CryoSleep status

14. Moderate spa expenditures (200-800) combined with low other spending (<200 total) correlate with increased transport probability for Mars-origin passengers

15. Earth-origin passengers with completely zero expenditures show reduced transport probability to 55 Cancri e regardless of age or CryoSleep status
