PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. For TRAPPIST-1e travelers from Mars with moderate total spending (300-2000), transport probability increases significantly, especially when spending distribution includes at least two amenities with ≥250 expenditure each, adjusting for age between 25-50

2. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with balanced moderate spending (150-1200 total) show elevated transport rates regardless of HomePlanet, particularly for ages 20-40 with non-concentrated spending patterns

3. CryoSleep-enabled passengers under age 10 show reduced transport probability (15-25%) regardless of destination or expenditure status, requiring additional verification through group travel patterns

4. Missing destination data combined with CryoSleep=true indicates high transport probability (>85%) for all HomePlanets except Earth, where additional age verification (under 16) reduces probability

5. Earth-origin passengers aged 18-30 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with spending between 200-1500 show increased transport likelihood, particularly when VRDeck or Spa expenditures represent less than 40% of total spending

6. Group transport consistency strengthens for groups of 2+ with same destination, showing >92% same-outcome probability when all members share similar age ranges (±5 years) and expenditure profiles

7. Intermediate age ranges (20-45) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate higher transport probability when total spending is between 300-1800 and includes at least two different amenity categories with minimum 50 expenditure each

8. Missing expenditure data in 3+ categories combined with TRAPPIST-1e destination indicates 70-80% transport probability for Mars/Europa origins, but only 30-40% for Earth origins

9. Cabin decks E and F show destination-dependent patterns: Deck E passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (200-1500) have elevated transport rates, while Deck F shows consistent high transport for Mars-origin passengers across destinations

10. Expenditure concentration threshold revised: Single-amenity spending exceeding 75% of total (rather than 60%) correlates with reduced transport probability, except for Spa expenditures on Europa-origin passengers

11. VIP status modifies transport probability most for Earth-origin passengers aged 25-45 traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 25-35% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts with similar spending profiles

12. Passengers with completely missing cabin data but valid destination show transport patterns aligned with their HomePlanet's baseline rates, with Mars/Europa origins maintaining 60-70% transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e
