PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers with moderate total expenditures (500-2000) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show significantly reduced transport probability, overriding general Earth-origin transport tendencies

2. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show variable transport probability based on destination: high probability for TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e (85%+), but reduced probability (<40%) for PSO J318.5-22 regardless of home planet

3. Mars-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates for TRAPPIST-1e destination when combined with low-moderate spending (100-1500 total), while showing reduced probability for 55 Cancri e with any spending activity

4. Intermediate age ranges (15-30) show destination-dependent transport reversal: higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e with low spending (<500) but lower probability for 55 Cancri e regardless of spending levels

5. VIP status creates differential transport outcomes: Earth VIPs show 25% lower transport rates than non-VIP Earth passengers across all destinations, while Mars VIPs show 15% higher transport probability

6. Expenditure concentration patterns: Spending exceeding 70% in any single amenity (particularly Spa or ShoppingMall) correlates with 40% reduced transport probability across all home planets and destinations

7. Cabin deck F passengers show elevated transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending, while deck G passengers show reduced transport probability for 55 Cancri e when combined with any expenditure

8. Missing expenditure data patterns differ by home planet: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers (75%+) but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers (<30%)

9. Age 0-12 passengers with any spending activity (â‰¥1) show near-zero transport probability, while those with zero spending maintain high transport probability except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22

10. Moderate spending thresholds vary by home planet: Earth passengers show reduced transport probability at lower thresholds (500-1500), while Mars and Europa passengers require higher spending (1500-3000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood

11. Group transport consistency weakens for mixed-age groups: Groups containing both children (0-12) and adults show reduced same-transport outcome probability (<60%) compared to same-age groups

12. Destination 55 Cancri e shows age-dependent transport patterns: Children (0-12) have near-zero transport probability regardless of spending, while adults (25-45) show reduced transport probability compared to other destinations
