PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 44
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures between 500-2000 show elevated transport probability, particularly when spending is distributed across multiple amenities rather than concentrated in single categories

2. Europa-origin passengers demonstrate consistently high transport rates regardless of expenditure levels when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, with FoodCourt spending above 2000 indicating particularly strong transport likelihood

3. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures but CryoSleep disabled show reduced transport probability across all destinations, requiring additional destination-based verification

4. Missing cabin data combined with Earth origin indicates reduced transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers, while Europa-origin passengers with missing cabin data show elevated transport rates

5. Moderate spending thresholds (800-2500 total) for non-VIP passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e indicate elevated transport probability when originating from Europa or Mars, but reduced probability when originating from Earth

6. Passengers aged 25-45 with balanced spending distribution (no single amenity exceeding 40% of total) show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly when total expenditures fall between 300-1500

7. Cabin decks F and G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show destination-modified transport patterns: Deck F passengers have elevated transport rates regardless of origin, while Deck G passengers require additional age and spending filters

8. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate strongly with transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but require home planet verification for accurate prediction

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for 55 Cancri e travelers, where VIPs show 30% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all spending levels

10. Concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 50% of total expenditures correlates with reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers, but shows neutral or positive correlation for Europa-origin passengers
