PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 49
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are transported, except when destination is 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22, where transport probability is significantly reduced.

2. For non-VIP passengers, total expenditures above 2000 reduce transport probability; for VIP passengers, expenditures above 5000 reduce transport probability. This reduction is less pronounced for TRAPPIST-1e destinations where thresholds are higher (2500 for non-VIP, 6000 for VIP).

3. Earth-origin passengers have elevated transport rates, but spending exceeding 2000 or travel to 55 Cancri e reduces transport likelihood substantially.

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures have high transport probability. Expenditures exceeding 500 for ages 0-5 or 1000 for ages 6-12 reduce transport probability.

5. Cabin deck transport patterns are reinforced: Deck F to TRAPPIST-1e has higher transport rates, while Deck G to 55 Cancri e has lower rates, with additional modulation by HomePlanet.

6. Missing expenditure data: Three or more NaN or zero values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower for Earth-origin passengers, especially when CryoSleep is false.

7. Group transport consistency is strong for groups of 3+ members. For pairs, transport outcome depends on age difference; differences greater than 15 years increase variability.

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show destination-dependent transport: TRAPPIST-1e travelers with spending below 1000 have higher transport probability, while 55 Cancri e travelers have lower probability regardless of spending.

9. VIP status reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e by 40% compared to non-VIP counterparts.

10. Concentrated spending in a single amenity (exceeding 70% of total spending) reduces transport probability across all destinations, with stronger effects for Spa and VRDeck expenditures.
