PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 43
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e where transport probability decreases significantly for all ages, particularly for children under 13

2. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when accompanied by total expenditures exceeding 1000 or when traveling to 55 Cancri e destination

3. Passengers aged 0-12 show significantly reduced transport probability when any spending activity (≥1 across amenities) is present, regardless of CryoSleep status or destination

4. Cabin decks G and T show stratified transport probabilities: Deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have reduced transport rates, while Deck T passengers show elevated transport probability across all destinations

5. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations

6. Intermediate age ranges (18-40) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with total spending <500, but significantly reduced probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending levels

7. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers, where VIPs show 35% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all destinations

8. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 70% of total spending correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations and home planets

9. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 4+ members show >95% same-transport outcome, while individual travelers show more variable patterns dependent on age and spending composition

10. Passengers with total expenditures between 200-2000 show reduced transport probability when traveling to PSO J318.5-22, regardless of home planet or age

11. Cabin section patterns: Passengers in section S show 25% higher transport probability than those in section P when traveling from Europa to TRAPPIST-1e

12. Age-spending interactions: Passengers under 18 with any VRDeck spending show 40% lower transport probability regardless of other factors

13. Missing destination data correlates with higher transport probability for CryoSleep-enabled passengers but lower probability for non-CryoSleep passengers

14. HomePlanet-destination-age interactions: Mars-origin passengers aged 25-45 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (500-1500) show elevated transport rates compared to other demographics

15. Expenditure threshold adjustments: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 800-3000 show reduced transport probability, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2500-6000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood
