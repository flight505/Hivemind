PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True and total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0 then predict Transported = True]

2. [If CryoSleep = True and total_spend > 0 then base prediction on spending composition: if non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck then predict Transported = True; if luxury_spend/(total_spend) > 0.5 then predict Transported = False]

3. [If non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 1000 then predict Transported = True]

4. [If total_spend > 3000 and (Spa + VRDeck)/(total_spend) > 0.5 (spending concentrated on luxury amenities) then predict Transported = False]

5. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 but non_luxury_spend > 500 (significant non-luxury activity alongside luxury) then predict Transported = True]

6. [If Age <= 2 and (total_spend == 0 or CryoSleep = True) then predict Transported = True; if 3 <= Age < 18 then predict Transported = True only when at least one of {CryoSleep = True, non_luxury_spend > 200, cabin-group majority = True} is present; otherwise do not force True for minors]

7. [If VIP = True, do not force Transported = True unconditionally; predict Transported = True for VIP only when at least one supporting signal exists (CryoSleep = True, non_luxury_spend > 200, or Cabin deck in A-C); otherwise treat VIP as an augmentation of other signals, not a standalone rule]

8. [If Cabin deck letter in A-C then increase transported likelihood: predict Transported = True unless spending is overwhelmingly luxury-dominated (Spa + VRDeck)/(total_spend) > 0.7 and total_spend > 3000; if deck in E-G (later decks) and both non_luxury_spend < 200 and luxury_spend < 200 then predict Transported = False]

9. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier, propagate the cabin-group majority: if majority of non-missing group members are predicted Transported = True then predict True for all members; if majority are predicted False then predict False for all members]

10. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e then raise threshold for predicting False and predict Transported = True when at least one of {CryoSleep = True, Age < 18, non_luxury_spend > 300} holds; if Destination = PSO J318.5-22 do not predict Transported = True on destination alone and require additional supportive signals (non_luxury_spend > 500 or Cabin A-C or VIP + supporting spend)]

11. [If HomePlanet = Earth and CryoSleep = False and total_spend between 300 and 3000 and (Spa + VRDeck)/(total_spend) < 0.5 then predict Transported = False (moderate non-luxury spending from Earth passengers leans False)]

12. [When HomePlanet or Age is missing, rely first on cabin-group majority; if cabin-group is inconclusive, use spending composition: if non_luxury_spend > luxury_spend and non_luxury_spend > 100 predict Transported = True; if luxury_spend > non_luxury_spend and total_spend > 1000 predict Transported = False]

13. [If signals conflict (e.g., CryoSleep = True but cabin deck is late and passenger is adult) prioritize clear spending signals: if non_luxury_spend >= 500 predict Transported = True despite conflicting location/cryosleep signals; if luxury_spend dominates by a large margin predict False]

14. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 5000 (extreme non-luxury expenditure) then predict Transported = True]
