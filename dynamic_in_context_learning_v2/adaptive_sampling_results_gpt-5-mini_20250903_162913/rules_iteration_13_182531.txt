PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False]
2. [If (Spa + VRDeck) > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
3. [If CryoSleep = True AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) == 0 AND Age < 60 then predict Transported = True]
4. [If CryoSleep = True AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) > 0 then predict Transported = False]
5. [If (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 500 AND (Spa + VRDeck) <= (0.5 * (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck)) then predict Transported = True]
6. [If (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) >= 5000 AND (Spa + VRDeck) / max(1, (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck)) > 0.5 then predict Transported = False]
7. [If VIP = True AND (CryoSleep = True OR (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) >= 250) then predict Transported = True]
8. [If VIP = True AND CryoSleep = False AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) == 0 AND Cabin suffix = 'P' is not present then predict Transported = False]
9. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND (CryoSleep = True OR Age <= 18) then predict Transported = True]
10. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e OR Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND (Spa + VRDeck) > 2000 then predict Transported = False]
11. [If Cabin deck letter is alphabetically early (A-D) AND (Spa + VRDeck + RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) == 0 AND CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True]
12. [If Cabin deck letter is alphabetically late (F, G or later) AND CryoSleep = False AND total_spend < 300 then predict Transported = False]
13. [If a passenger has missing/inconsistent CryoSleep (NaN) but cabin-group members exist, use cabin-group majority: if majority of same-cabin passengers are predicted Transported = True then predict True; if majority are predicted False then predict False]
14. [If Cabin identifier is shared by multiple passengers and at least two members have strong positive signals (CryoSleep True with zero spend OR non-luxury spend >= 500 OR VIP with spend >=250) then predict Transported = True for all members of that cabin group]
15. [If a passenger shows moderate-to-high spending concentrated in non-luxury amenities (any single non-luxury amenity > 1000) then predict Transported = True]
16. [If a passenger shows contradictory signals (e.g., CryoSleep = True but substantial spend in any amenity > 0) prefer the non-cryosleep signals (treat as not in CryoSleep) and apply spending/age/VIP rules accordingly]
