PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True (CryoSleep is the strongest single indicator).]
2. [If non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall >= 500 then predict Transported = True (moderate-to-high everyday spending strongly correlates with being transported).]
3. [If non_luxury_spend >= 2000 then predict Transported = True (very high everyday spending almost always indicates transported).]
4. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then: if non_luxury_spend >= (Spa + VRDeck) predict Transported = True else predict Transported = False (large total spending should be classified by whether it is driven by everyday vs. luxury amenities).]
5. [If luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck > non_luxury_spend and luxury_spend > 1000 then predict Transported = False (very large luxury-focused spending tends to indicate non-transported in the data).]
6. [If Age < 18 then predict Transported = True (children and minors are more likely to be transported).]
7. [If Age >= 60 and CryoSleep != True and non_luxury_spend < 500 and VIP != True then predict Transported = False (older adults without cryosleep, VIP status, or meaningful everyday spending are less likely to be transported).]
8. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True unless a strong luxury-dominant spending pattern indicates non-transport (i.e., Spa+VRDeck substantially exceeds everyday spend and exceeds a high luxury threshold).]
9. [If CryoSleep is missing/NaN and total_spend == 0 (all amenity spends are zero or missing) then infer likely CryoSleep-like behaviour and predict Transported = True.]
10. [If Destination is one of the long/rare routes (e.g., TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e, PSO J318.5-22) and non_luxury_spend >= 500 then predict Transported = True (route + everyday spending increases transported likelihood).]
11. [When cabin-group membership is present (same cabin identifier shared by multiple Passenger records), propagate the cabin-group majority: if a clear majority of that cabin-group is predicted one way, predict that same Transported value for all members of that cabin-group (use to resolve missing/inconsistent demographics).]
12. [If cabin-group signals conflict with an individual CryoSleep signal (e.g., one member CryoSleep=True but majority of cabin-group predicted False), defer to the cabin-group majority unless the individual's non_luxury_spend >= 2000 or CryoSleep=True with no contradictory spend (group patterns override isolated noisy CryoSleep labels).]
13. [If Cabin deck letter is present and a consistent deck-side pattern emerges from cabin-group (e.g., identical deck/side with strong group majority), use that deck-side/group pattern as an additional tie-breaker for ambiguous individual signals; do not use deck letter alone as a hard rule.] 
14. [If contradictory signals remain (for example CryoSleep=True but very large luxury_spend dominating and cabin-group majority False), resolve by weighted rules: prioritize (1) cabin-group majority, (2) very high non_luxury_spend (>=2000), (3) CryoSleep, (4) VIP, and (5) age-based rules.] 
15. [If demographic or HomePlanet is missing, rely on spending composition, CryoSleep inference, destination and cabin-group rules rather than treating missing demographics as negative evidence.]
