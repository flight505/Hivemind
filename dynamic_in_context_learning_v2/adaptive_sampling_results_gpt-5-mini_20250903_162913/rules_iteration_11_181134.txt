PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 11
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 1000 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If CryoSleep = True and total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If CryoSleep = True and total_spend > 0 then do NOT automatically predict Transported; instead apply spending-based rules (non_luxury_spend, luxury_spend) to decide]
4. [If luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck > 1000 and luxury_spend > non_luxury_spend then predict Transported = False]
5. [If total_spend > 3000 and luxury_spend > non_luxury_spend then predict Transported = False; otherwise if total_spend > 3000 but non_luxury_spend >= luxury_spend then predict Transported = True]
6. [If Age <= 2 then predict Transported = True]
7. [If 3 <= Age < 18 then predict Transported = True only if (CryoSleep = True) OR (non_luxury_spend >= 200); otherwise do not force True]
8. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False unless non_luxury_spend > 1000 OR VIP = True OR cabin-group majority is True, in which case predict True]
9. [If VIP = True then increase likelihood of Transported = True, but if luxury_spend > 1000 then predict Transported = False (VIP status is overridden by very high luxury spending pattern)]
10. [If Destination is PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True; otherwise use general spending/age/VIP rules for that destination]
11. [If HomePlanet is missing, infer likely outcome from cabin-group majority; if no cabin-group info, use spending rules (non_luxury_spend > 1000 => True, luxury_spend dominant => False)]
12. [If Cabin group (same deck/number/side) contains multiple passengers and a majority are predicted Transported = True then predict Transported = True for all members; conversely if majority predicted False then predict False for remaining members]
13. [If Cabin is missing but non_luxury_spend >= 500 then predict Transported = True; if Cabin missing and luxury_spend > non_luxury_spend and luxury_spend > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
14. [If passenger shows near-zero total_spend (<= 50) and CryoSleep = False and Age <= 3 then predict Transported = True]
15. [If a passenger has CryoSleep = False, total_spend = 0, Age 18-60, and no VIP flag, predict Transported = False]
16. [If mixed signals (e.g., CryoSleep = True but substantial spending) resolve by spending composition: non_luxury_spend dominant => predict True; luxury_spend dominant => predict False]
17. [When demographic signals are missing or inconsistent (missing Age/HomePlanet/Cabin), prioritize cabin-group consensus if available, otherwise prioritize spending-based decisions (rule 1,4,5)]
18. [If non_luxury_spend is moderate (300 < non_luxury_spend <= 1000) and Age between 18 and 60, predict Transported = True if RoomService or FoodCourt make up >50% of non_luxury_spend; otherwise defer to luxury_spend rule]
19. [If very high single-category spend (any one of RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 4000 then predict Transported = False if that spend is luxury-dominated (Spa or VRDeck), otherwise predict True if non-luxury-dominated]
20. [Apply rules in priority order: cabin-group consensus > high non_luxury_spend rules > luxury-dominant total_spend rules > age exceptions > CryoSleep zero-spend rule > VIP adjustments]
