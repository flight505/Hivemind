PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True]
2. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True]
3. [If any single amenity spend (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 1000 then predict Transported = True]
4. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 1000 then predict Transported = True]
5. [If FoodCourt > 500 or ShoppingMall > 500 or RoomService > 500 (strong non-luxury engagement) then predict Transported = True]
6. [If Spa + VRDeck (luxury spending) > 1000 then predict Transported = True]
7. [If Age <= 16 then predict Transported = True]
8. [If CryoSleep is missing (NaN) and (Age <= 5 OR total_spend == 0) then predict Transported = True]
9. [If Age >= 65 and CryoSleep = False and total_spend == 0 then predict Transported = False]
10. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e and (any amenity spend > 100 OR total_spend > 300) then predict Transported = True]
11. [If Destination is missing but passenger shows high single-amenity or total spending (>1000) then predict Transported = True]
12. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier (same deck/number/side) and at least one group member is predicted Transported = True, then predict Transported = True for all members of that cabin group]
13. [If HomePlanet is Europa or Mars and CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True (CryoSleep effect reinforced for these origins)]
14. [If HomePlanet is Earth and CryoSleep = False and moderate spending (0 < total_spend <= 300) then predict Transported = True if spending is concentrated in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall; otherwise defer to other rules]
15. [If demographic or location features are missing or inconsistent (missing HomePlanet, missing Age) but cabin-group consensus exists, use the cabin-group majority to predict the passenger's Transported status]
