PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True]
2. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True]
3. [If Age < 18 (child/infant) then predict Transported = True]
4. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False]
5. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then predict Transported = False]
6. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 (spending concentrated on luxury/leisure amenities) then predict Transported = False]
7. [If total_spend = 0 and CryoSleep is False but passenger is very young (Age <= 5) then predict Transported = True]
8. [If HomePlanet indicates a minority/remote origin and Destination = PSO J318.5-22 (long/rare route) then predict Transported = True]
9. [If Cabin deck letter is in early alphabet (e.g., A-C) then predict Transported = True; if deck letter is in later alphabet (e.g., E-G or higher) then predict Transported = False]
10. [If Cabin side and number indicate grouping (same Cabin identifier shared by multiple passengers) and at least one group member is predicted Transported = True then predict Transported = True for all members of that same Cabin group]
11. [If Passenger shows very high FoodCourt or ShoppingMall spend (>5000) while low luxury spend (Spa+VRDeck small) then predict Transported = True]
12. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and passenger is middle-aged (18-60) with moderate-to-high non-luxury spending (RoomService or ShoppingMall > 500) then predict Transported = False]
13. [If HomePlanet = Earth and CryoSleep = False and total_spend is moderate-to-high but not luxury (300 < total_spend <= 3000) then predict Transported = False]
14. [If Cabin position shows private/premium suffix (e.g., deck with 'P' or a small cabin number indicating premium placement) and VIP = True then predict Transported = True]
15. [If inconsistent/missing demographic signals (missing HomePlanet or missing Age) but group cabin members are mostly predicted one way, use the cabin-group majority to predict the passenger's Transported status]
