PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall (nonluxury_spend) >= 500 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If ShoppingMall >= 500 or FoodCourt >= 1000 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If Spa + VRDeck (luxury_spend) > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
4. [If luxury_spend > 1000 AND nonluxury_spend >= 500 then use nonluxury_spend majority (predict Transported = True) â€” i.e., nonluxury spending can override luxury-only signal]
5. [If CryoSleep = True AND (nonluxury_spend <= 100 AND luxury_spend <= 200) then predict Transported = True]
6. [If CryoSleep = True AND luxury_spend > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
7. [If VIP = True AND (nonluxury_spend > 0 OR cabin indicates premium placement (deck letter in A-C or cabin suffix 'P')) then predict Transported = True; otherwise do not let VIP alone force Transported = True]
8. [If Age < 18 then predict Transported = True; if Age <= 5 and total_spend == 0 then predict Transported = True]
9. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep is False AND nonluxury_spend < 100 AND luxury_spend < 100 then predict Transported = False]
10. [If Cabin deck letter is A-C (early decks) then increase probability -> predict Transported = True unless strong luxury_spend > 1000 indicates otherwise]
11. [If Cabin deck letter is E-G or higher (later decks) AND nonluxury_spend < 300 AND luxury_spend < 300 then predict Transported = False]
12. [If two or more passengers share the exact Cabin identifier, set all members' prediction to the cabin-group majority (apply after individual rules)]
13. [If key demographic or cabin fields are missing (HomePlanet, Age, CryoSleep) and cabin-group provides a majority prediction, use the cabin-group majority prediction]
14. [If Destination is 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e AND nonluxury_spend >= 300 then predict Transported = True (moderate nonluxury spending on common routes indicates Transported)]
15. [If HomePlanet = Europa or Mars combined with CryoSleep = True (and not overridden by high luxury_spend) then bias toward predict Transported = True; if HomePlanet = Earth and nonluxury_spend is small and luxury_spend is large then bias toward predict Transported = False]
16. [When rules conflict, prioritize: group/cabin-majority rule, then high nonluxury_spend rules, then CryoSleep rules, then VIP/cabin premium, then age-based exceptions]
