PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 9
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService) > 500 (non-luxury spending concentrated) then predict Transported = True]

2. [If FoodCourt > 1000 or ShoppingMall > 1000 (very high single-channel non-luxury spend) then predict Transported = True]

3. [If Spa + VRDeck > 2 * (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService) and (Spa + VRDeck) > 300 (spending dominated by luxury/entertainment) then predict Transported = False]

4. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0 and Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True]

5. [If Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True (very young children strongly associated with transported)]

6. [If Age >= 60 and total_spend < 500 then predict Transported = False (older passengers with low activity unlikely transported)]

7. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService) > 300 then predict Transported = True (non-luxury activity on this route increases transported likelihood)]

8. [Do not treat CryoSleep as an automatic positive; predict Transported = True for CryoSleep only when a supporting signal is present: CryoSleep = True AND (Age <= 18 OR (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService) = 0 OR (Spa + VRDeck) = 0) then predict Transported = True; otherwise defer to spending/age/cabin-group rules]

9. [Do not treat VIP = True as an automatic positive; predict Transported = True for VIP only if VIP = True AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall >= 200 OR CryoSleep = True OR cabin-group majority indicates transported)]

10. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 and Spa + VRDeck > (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService) (heavy luxury spending) then predict Transported = False, unless overridden by strong non-luxury activity or child presence]

11. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier (same deck/number/side) and at least one group member has a strong transported signal (CryoSleep with supporting signal, Age <= 5, or non-luxury spend > 500), then predict Transported = True for all members of that same Cabin group]

12. [If Age between 6 and 18, require a supporting non-luxury signal to predict True: (Age > 5 and Age <= 18) AND (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService > 200 OR cabin-group transported majority OR CryoSleep with supporting signal) then predict Transported = True; otherwise predict Transported = False]

13. [When HomePlanet is missing, rely on spending, age and cabin-group signals: if HomePlanet is NaN AND (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + RoomService > 500 OR Age <= 5 OR cabin-group majority = transported) then predict Transported = True; else follow normal spending/age/luxury rules]

14. [If total_spend > 3000 but spending is concentrated in Spa + VRDeck (Spa + VRDeck > 0.6 * total_spend) then predict Transported = False (very high spend dominated by luxury correlates with not transported)]

15. [When conflicting weak signals exist (e.g., CryoSleep = True but non-luxury spend high for same passenger), prioritize non-luxury spending and cabin-group consensus over isolated CryoSleep or VIP flags]
