IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True AND sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) == 0 or all spending values are missing then predict Transported = True]

2. [If CryoSleep = True AND any spending category (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 0 then predict Transported = False (treat as contradictory record indicating not transported)]

3. [Do NOT automatically predict Transported for Age < 18; instead predict Transported = True for minors only when accompanied by a strong positive signal: CryoSleep = True OR cabin-group majority predicted Transported = True OR very low total_spend (all spends == 0) combined with missing/young age]

4. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep = False then predict Transported = False; if Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True (age effect interacts with CryoSleep)]

5. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then predict Transported = False (very high overall spend strongly associated with not transported)]

6. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 then predict Transported = False (luxury amenity concentration signals not transported)]

7. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 2000 AND Spa + VRDeck <= 500 then predict Transported = True (high non-luxury spending pattern increases transported likelihood)]

8. [If a single luxury category is extremely large (VRDeck > 3000 OR Spa > 3000) then predict Transported = False (extreme single-category luxury spend treated as anomaly associated with not transported)]

9. [If VIP = True then increase transported probability BUT do not override contradictory signals: predict Transported = True only if NOT (CryoSleep = True with any spend >0 OR total_spend > 3000 OR Spa + VRDeck > 1000); otherwise defer to spending/CryoSleep rules]

10. [Use Cabin deck letter as a modifier, not absolute: if deck in {A,B,C} and CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True; if deck in {E,F,G,...} and CryoSleep = False and non-luxury spend is low (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall < 300) then predict Transported = False]

11. [When passengers share an identical Cabin identifier, propagate Transported prediction across the cabin ONLY when at least one cabin member provides a strong, non-contradictory signal (CryoSleep = True with zero spend, VIP = True with no contradictory spends, OR non-luxury sum > 2000); otherwise do not force unanimous cabin label]

12. [Destination-modulated rules: for PSO J318.5-22, treat CryoSleep = False plus moderate-to-high total_spend (>500) as evidence to predict Transported = False; for TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = True or young age with zero spend increases probability of Transported = True]

13. [When CryoSleep is missing/NaN treat it conservatively as False unless there are at least two independent positive indicators (VIP = True, non-luxury spend > 500, or cabin-mate CryoSleep = True) in which case predict Transported = True]

14. [When HomePlanet or Age are missing, base prediction on robust signals in order: CryoSleep + spend pattern + VIP + cabin-majority; require at least two supporting signals to predict Transported = True]

15. [If all spends == 0, CryoSleep = False, VIP = False, and Age is unknown or >50 then predict Transported = False (absence of engagement + no CryoSleep + older age -> not transported)]

16. [Resolve tied/uncertain cases by prioritizing consistency checks: if spending pattern and CryoSleep disagree, follow the CryoSleep rules (rules 1–3); if spending pattern and VIP disagree, require spending-based thresholds (rules 5–8) to override VIP]
