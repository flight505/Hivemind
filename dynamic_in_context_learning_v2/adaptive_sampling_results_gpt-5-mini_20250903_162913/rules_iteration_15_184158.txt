PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 500 then predict Transported = True (non‑luxury activity strongly indicates transported), regardless of CryoSleep or HomePlanet, unless overridden by a stronger group majority rule.]

2. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) <= 500 then predict Transported = False (high luxury-only spending with little non‑luxury activity correlates with not transported).]

3. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) > 500 then predict Transported = True (concurrent high luxury and high non‑luxury spending indicates transported).]

4. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then predict Transported = True when the majority of that spend is non_luxury (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall >= 0.5 * total_spend); otherwise predict Transported = False (very large spenders are transported only when spending is concentrated in non‑luxury amenities).]

5. [If CryoSleep = True and all amenity spends are zero or missing (no recorded spending) then predict Transported = True (preserve CryoSleep signal when there is no evidence passenger was active).]

6. [If CryoSleep = True but any single amenity spend > 200 then ignore the CryoSleep signal and apply spending-based rules (treat the passenger as active; use rules 1–4 and luxury rules instead of automatically predicting transported).]

7. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True unless overridden by a strong countervailing spending pattern (e.g., Spa+VRDeck > 1000 with non_luxury_spend <= 500) or unanimous cabin-group majority = False.]

8. [If Age < 18 then predict Transported = True unless the passenger has very high luxury-only spending (Spa+VRDeck > 1000 and non_luxury_spend <= 500) indicating a different pattern.]

9. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False unless there is strong evidence of transported behavior (non_luxury_spend > 500 or CryoSleep = True with no spending), in which case predict Transported = True.]

10. [If Destination is PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e then increase transported likelihood: predict Transported = True when at least one of (CryoSleep = True with no spending, Age < 18, non_luxury_spend > 300, VIP = True) holds; otherwise rely on standard spending and cabin rules.]

11. [If Cabin deck letter is A–C then raise transported likelihood (predict Transported = True when other signals are neutral); if deck letter is E–G (later decks) then lower transported likelihood (predict Transported = False when other signals are neutral). Always let spending and CryoSleep-with-activity rules override pure deck priors.]

12. [If a cabin identifier is shared by multiple passengers (family/group) then apply a cabin-group consensus rule: if the majority of group members meet transported criteria by the above rules, predict Transported = True for all group members; if the majority meet not‑transported criteria, predict Transported = False for all; use spending aggregates (sum of non_luxury_spend across group) to break ties.]

13. [If HomePlanet is missing or inconsistent, rely on spending, CryoSleep-with-activity, cabin-deck priors, and destination rules (do not default to not transported); missing HomePlanet should not bias toward a specific label.]

14. [When amenity spending is sparse or contradictory (many NaNs) and no cabin-group majority exists, default to: predict Transported = True if CryoSleep = True or Age < 18 or VIP = True; otherwise predict Transported = False.]

15. [If VRDeck > 1000 but (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) <= 300 and Spa <= 500 then predict Transported = False (extreme VRDeck-only activity with little other activity tends to indicate not transported unless non_luxury activity is also high).]
