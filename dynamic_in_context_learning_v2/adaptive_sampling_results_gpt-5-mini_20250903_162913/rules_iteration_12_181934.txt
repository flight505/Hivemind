PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 12
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If any non-luxury spend (RoomService or FoodCourt or ShoppingMall) > 300 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If CryoSleep = True and Age < 60 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If CryoSleep = True and Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False]
4. [If Age < 18 and (CryoSleep = True or RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 0 or Cabin deck letter in {A,B,C}) then predict Transported = True]
5. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False unless overridden by strong positive non-luxury spending (RoomService or FoodCourt or ShoppingMall > 300) or explicit cabin-group majority = True]
6. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
7. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0 and CryoSleep = False and Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True]
8. [If ShoppingMall > 300 and (Spa + VRDeck) is small (<= 200) then predict Transported = True]
9. [If Destination in {TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e} and (RoomService > 200 or FoodCourt > 200 or ShoppingMall > 200) then predict Transported = True]
10. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True unless contradicted by strong negative signals (Age >= 60 with no non-luxury spend > 300 or Spa+VRDeck > 1000) then predict Transported = False]
11. [If Cabin deck letter in {A,B,C} and (CryoSleep = True or any non-luxury spend > 0 or Age < 18) then predict Transported = True]
12. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier (same deck/number/side) then predict Transported for the passenger to match the majority Transported outcome among that cabin group; if tied, fall back to spending/CryoSleep/age rules]
13. [If HomePlanet is missing but cabin-group or same-family (same surname/grouping) signals exist, use cabin-group or family majority prediction; otherwise rely on spending and CryoSleep rules]
14. [If data are inconsistent/missing (Age missing or CryoSleep missing) and non-luxury spending > 300 then predict Transported = True; if spending = 0 and Spa+VRDeck > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
15. [If long/rare destination = PSO J318.5-22 then increase transport likelihood (predict True) only when supported by CryoSleep = True or non-luxury spend > 300; otherwise do not force True]
