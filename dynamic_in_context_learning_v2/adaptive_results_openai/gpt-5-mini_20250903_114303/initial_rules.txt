PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If a passenger shares the same Cabin (same deck/number/side) with others, predict the same Transported outcome as the cabin's majority; if the cabin's outcomes are unknown, use the cabin group's aggregate signals (majority CryoSleep, majority VIP, or highest average TotalSpend) to decide.

2. Define TotalSpend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck. If TotalSpend is high relative to peers (strong positive spending signal), predict Transported = True.

3. Use age demographics: infants/toddlers (age <= 3) follow accompanying adults/caregivers; children and teenagers (age 4–17) follow the adult majority in their cabin/group; adults (age 18–59) are predicted primarily from spend/VIP/CryoSleep signals; seniors (age >= 60) require VIP, CryoSleep with nonzero spend, or high TotalSpend to predict Transported = True, otherwise predict False.

4. If VIP == True, predict Transported = True unless there is a strong cabin-group consensus of False.

5. If CryoSleep == True and TotalSpend is near zero and VIP == False and the passenger is not a dependent child, predict Transported = False.

6. If CryoSleep == True and TotalSpend is moderate or high or VIP == True, predict Transported = True.

7. If CryoSleep == False and TotalSpend is moderate or high, predict Transported = True.

8. If CryoSleep == False and TotalSpend is very low and Age is adult (18–59) and VIP == False and there is no positive cabin-group signal, predict Transported = False.

9. Use HomePlanet and Destination as modifiers: if a passenger's HomePlanet→Destination pattern aligns with group-level patterns associated with positive transport outcomes and other signals (spend, VIP, CryoSleep) are positive, bias toward True; if Destination is rare for the HomePlanet and spend/VIP are low, bias toward False.

10. Cabin-location heuristic: passengers on mid/upper decks (earlier deck letters) or on private/status sides with nonzero spending are more likely Transported = True; passengers on lower/outer decks (later deck letters) with zero spending and no VIP are more likely Transported = False.

11. Family/group relationships override weak individual signals: if most members of a family/group (same surname or same Cabin group) are predicted True, predict True for remaining members; likewise predict False if the majority are predicted False.

12. Fallback: when signals conflict or are missing, default to False for low-risk profiles (no VIP, low/zero TotalSpend, CryoSleep False/unknown, adult 18–59, no positive cabin-group signal) and default to True when at least two independent positive signals are present among {VIP, high TotalSpend, CryoSleep with nonzero spend, cabin-group majority True}.
