PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Treat CryoSleep == True as a primary positive indicator: predict Transported = True for CryoSleep passengers unless there is explicit, consistent, and independent negative evidence from multiple signals (for example a clear cabin/family majority of known False together with an unfavourable HomePlanet→Destination baseline). Do not use zero spending alone to overturn CryoSleep.

2. Refine spending: define TotalSpend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck. Consider TotalSpend a positive signal only when it is high relative to HomePlanet peers AND it is supported by spending in two or more amenity categories (i.e., diversified spending). Treat single-category spend spikes as weak/ambiguous and require corroboration by another independent positive signal before predicting True.

3. Use VIP as a conditional positive: VIP == True increases transport probability but is not decisive alone. Require at least one additional independent positive signal (diversified high TotalSpend, CryoSleep True, supportive cabin/family majority, or favorable HomePlanet→Destination baseline) for VIP passengers to be predicted True. If VIP is the sole positive signal and other indicators are neutral/negative, default to False.

4. Apply cabin/family majority with age-aware exceptions: when same-cabin or clear family grouping has known Transported outcomes, propagate the majority to undecided members. However, allow age-based divergence: infants/toddlers (<=3) follow caregivers; children/teenagers (4–17) generally follow caregivers but are re-evaluated if their own signals (CryoSleep status, nonzero diversified spend, or VIP) differ; adults (18–59) follow the family/cabin majority unless they present multiple independent counter-signals.

5. Require multiple independent positive signals for non-CryoSleep positives: for passengers without CryoSleep==True, predict Transported = True only when at least two independent positive signals are present among {VIP True, diversified high TotalSpend (per Rule 2), cabin/family majority True, favorable HomePlanet→Destination baseline}. A single positive signal (especially spending alone) should not suffice.

6. Bias by HomePlanet→Destination empirical baselines: compute empirical Transported rates per HomePlanet→Destination pairing and use them to adjust thresholds — lower the threshold for True in high-baseline pairings and raise it in low-baseline pairings. In low-baseline pairings demand extra independent positive signals to predict True.

7. Use age-based priors: infants/toddlers (<=3) default to caregiver/cabin outcome; children/teens (4–17) require caregiver/cabin support or their own positive signals to be predicted True; adults (18–59) follow the multi-signal decision logic; seniors (>=60) require at least one strong positive signal (CryoSleep True, VIP True, or diversified high TotalSpend) to predict True.

8. Treat cabin location as a secondary modifier only: deck letter and side (P/S) adjust probability slightly (upper/mid decks and private sides give a mild positive tilt; lower/outer decks give a mild negative tilt) but never override the multi-signal decision—cabin location alone cannot decide True.

9. Downweight outlier spend patterns: if a passenger's TotalSpend is heavily dominated by a single amenity (e.g., the vast majority of spend in one category), consider it an outlier and downweight its effect; require an additional independent positive signal to predict True.

10. Be conservative with missing data: when cabin, HomePlanet, Destination, or multiple spend fields are missing, avoid inferring cabin/family effects and require stronger personal evidence (CryoSleep True or at least two independent positive signals) before predicting True.

11. Resolve conflicts by voting of independent signals: count independent positive signals versus negative signals and predict True only when positives exceed negatives by at least one. Treat CryoSleep True as a strong vote (effective double weight) because it is a reliable single-party positive in observed patterns.

12. Conservative fallback default: when signals are insufficient or contradictory and no CryoSleep True exists, default to False for low-risk profiles (no VIP, low/zero diversified TotalSpend, adult 18–59, no supportive cabin/family signals); predict True only when the above multi-signal criteria are satisfied.
