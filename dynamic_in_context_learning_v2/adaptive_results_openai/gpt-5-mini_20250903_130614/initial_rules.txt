PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep is True AND the passenger has zero or missing total onboard spending (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck ≈ 0), then Predict Transported = True.
2. If CryoSleep is True AND the passenger has any non‑zero onboard spending, then Predict Transported = False.
3. If total onboard spending (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) is very high (e.g., >= 3000), then Predict Transported = False.
4. If VRDeck spending alone is very high (e.g., >= 2000), then Predict Transported = False.
5. If combined food spending (RoomService + FoodCourt) is high (e.g., >= 1500) and CryoSleep is False, then Predict Transported = False.
6. If Age <= 2 (infants/toddlers), then Predict Transported = True.
7. If 3 <= Age <= 17 (children/teens) AND the passenger is travelling in a family/group cabin where at least one adult is predicted Transported = True, then Predict Transported = True (children follow guardians).
8. If Age >= 60 (seniors), then Predict Transported = True.
9. If VIP is True AND (CryoSleep is True OR total onboard spending is zero/missing), then Predict Transported = True; if VIP is True AND total onboard spending is appreciable (non‑zero), then Predict Transported = False.
10. HomePlanet signal: when CryoSleep is True, passengers from planets with historically higher preservation rates (e.g., Europa in the dataset patterns) are more likely Transported = True; conversely, high spenders from planets with higher active usage (e.g., Earth) are more likely Transported = False.
11. Destination signal: passengers bound for destinations with lower observed active onboard usage who are also in CryoSleep or have low spending are more likely Predict Transported = True; passengers headed to destinations associated with heavy onboard activity and high spending are more likely Predict Transported = False.
12. Cabin group consistency: if multiple passengers share the same cabin identifier (same deck/number/side), predict the same Transported outcome for all cabin mates; use majority vote among group members when making the group's prediction.
13. Cabin location pattern: passengers housed on deeper/interior decks or cabin locations historically correlated with higher transport outcomes (e.g., lower/engine‑side deck designations or higher cabin numbers) are more likely Predict Transported = True; passengers on forward/outer decks or deck/positions correlated with active service areas are more likely Predict Transported = False.
14. Mixed signals resolution: when features conflict (e.g., CryoSleep True but very high spending), prioritize CryoSleep + zero spending and family/cabin consistency for Predict Transported = True; prioritize very high spending, heavy VR usage, or large food/room spending for Predict Transported = False.
15. Default fallback: if none of the above rules apply or information is insufficient, Predict Transported = False.
