PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep = True AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) = 0 or only NaNs, predict Transported = True.
2. If CryoSleep = True AND any of RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck > 0, predict Transported = False.
3. If CryoSleep is missing AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) = 0 or only NaNs, treat as CryoSleep = True and predict Transported = True.
4. If CryoSleep = False AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 2000, predict Transported = False.
5. If CryoSleep = False AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) <= 50 AND Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = True.
6. If the sum(Spa, VRDeck) > 1000 OR FoodCourt > 1000 (regardless of CryoSleep), predict Transported = False.
7. If spending occurs in multiple categories (three or more nonzero among RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck), predict Transported = False.
8. If spending is low and concentrated (exactly one nonzero category <= 300) AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = True.
9. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep ≠ False (True or missing inferred from zero spend), predict Transported = True.
10. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
11. If Destination = 55 Cancri e AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 0 AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
12. If HomePlanet = Europa AND CryoSleep ≠ False (True or inferred via zero spend), predict Transported = True.
13. If HomePlanet = Mars AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
14. If HomePlanet = Earth AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 0 AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
15. If VIP = True AND the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) > 0, predict Transported = False.
16. If VIP = True AND CryoSleep = True AND spending = 0, predict Transported = True.
17. If Age <= 12 AND (CryoSleep = True OR the sum(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) = 0), predict Transported = True.
18. If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
19. If Cabin side = 'P' (Cabin formatted Deck/Number/Side) AND CryoSleep ≠ False (True or zero spend inferred), predict Transported = True.
20. If Cabin side = 'S' AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
21. If Cabin deck in {B, C, E} AND CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
22. If Cabin deck in {F, G, T} AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
23. If Cabin is missing, rely on CryoSleep and spending rules; if still ambiguous and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = True; if Destination = PSO J318.5-22, predict Transported = False.
24. If multiple passengers share the same group identifier (prefix of PassengerId before underscore) and most known group members are Transported = True, predict the passenger = True; if most are False, predict False.
25. If multiple passengers share the same Cabin (or same Deck and Number with either side) and a clear majority of those cabin-linked passengers are Transported = True, predict True; if majority are False, predict False.
26. If CryoSleep is missing AND spending > 0, treat as CryoSleep = False and apply destination/home/spending rules (typically skewing to False when spend is high or multi-category).
27. If HomePlanet is missing, prioritize CryoSleep and spending; if CryoSleep = True with zero spend, predict True; else fallback to destination (TRAPPIST-1e -> True, PSO/55 Cancri e with spend -> False).
28. If ShoppingMall or VRDeck is the dominant spend category (largest share) and total spend > 800 AND CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
29. If RoomService is the only nonzero spend (others zero) AND total spend <= 1200 AND Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = True.
30. If Age is missing, disregard age and follow CryoSleep, spending, destination, and cabin-side/deck rules for prediction.
