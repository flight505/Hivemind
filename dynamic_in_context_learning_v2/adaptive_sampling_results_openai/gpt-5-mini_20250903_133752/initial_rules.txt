PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep is True AND HomePlanet is Europa, predict Transported = True.]
2. [If CryoSleep is True AND the cabin deck letter is C or D (Cabin starts with 'C/' or 'D/'), predict Transported = True.]
3. [If CryoSleep is True AND total spend (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) is zero or missing, predict Transported = True.]
4. [If CryoSleep is True AND total spend > 0 (passenger used ship services), predict Transported = False.]
5. [If CryoSleep is False AND total spend (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) is very high (e.g., top spenders or sum >= 2000), predict Transported = False.]
6. [If CryoSleep is False AND a single entertainment/wellness category (VRDeck or Spa or FoodCourt) dominates the passenger's spending (majority share >50% of their spend) and total spend > 100, predict Transported = False.]
7. [If VIP is True AND (CryoSleep is True OR HomePlanet is Europa), predict Transported = True.]
8. [If HomePlanet is Europa AND total spend is low/zero and cabin deck is C (or passenger travels with others from the same Europa cabin), predict Transported = True.]
9. [If Age is a young child (Age <= 4) AND CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.]
10. [If Age < 18 AND the passenger is part of a cabin-group (shares the same cabin deck and number) use the group's majority: predict Transported = group's majority status (if group members known); if group majority is True predict True, if group majority is False predict False.]
11. [If Cabin deck is F or G AND CryoSleep is False AND spending is moderate-to-high (>200), predict Transported = False.]
12. [If Destination is TRAPPIST-1e AND HomePlanet is Europa (or cabin deck is C and CryoSleep is True), predict Transported = True.]
13. [If HomePlanet is Earth AND CryoSleep is False AND spending is low-to-moderate, predict Transported = False (unless overridden by strong group/cabin evidence).]
14. [If passenger has missing HomePlanet or Destination but shares a cabin (deck/number/side) with others whose transport status is known or strongly predicted, inherit the cabin-group's status.]
15. [If none of the above specific rules apply, default to predict Transported = False unless strong group/cabin, VIP, or CryoSleep+Europa evidence indicates True.]
