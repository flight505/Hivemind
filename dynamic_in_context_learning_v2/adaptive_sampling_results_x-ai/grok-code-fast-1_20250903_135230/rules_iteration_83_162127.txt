PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 83
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 25-35 destined for TRAPPIST-1e with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, emphasizing moderate shopping-focused spending patterns in young adult Mars groups overriding inactivity expectations.
2. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 30-40 with RoomService exceeding 500 and moderate VRDeck or Spa spending are likely to be transported, addressing high-room-service outliers in mid-aged Mars demographics.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 destined for TRAPPIST-1e with total spending between 500 and 1000 across amenities are likely to be transported, refining youth expenditure trends despite non-Cryo status.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-25 destined for PSO J318.5-22 with FoodCourt spending between 400 and 600 are likely to be transported, prioritizing young adult food expenditure patterns.
5. CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 45-50 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, correcting optimistic assumptions for older zero-activity Mars groups.
6. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 30-36 destined for 55 Cancri e with ShoppingMall exceeding 800 and low RoomService are likely to be transported, highlighting senior leisure reversals in middle-aged Mars patterns.
7. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 22-26 on F or E decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e with VRDeck exceeding 400 and moderate Spa spending are likely to be transported, mitigating entertainment-focused outliers in young Earth demographics.
