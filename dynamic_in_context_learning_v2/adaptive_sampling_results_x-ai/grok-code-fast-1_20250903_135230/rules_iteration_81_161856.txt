PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 81
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with all zero spending are likely to be transported if from Europa or Mars and destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, adjusting for upper-class priority in long-distance cryogenic travel.
2. Earth CryoSleep passengers aged under 18 or over 40 with all zero spending are likely to be transported if on G deck cabins, correcting youth and senior priority overrides in zero-expenditure cryo scenarios.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on F or E deck cabins with ShoppingMall or FoodCourt spending exceeding 700 are likely to be transported when destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22, refining spending-based transport likelihood for young adults.
4. Europa non-CryoSleep passengers with total amenity spending exceeding 1500 and RoomService under 300 are likely to be transported, prioritizing high-expenditure elites in non-cryo upper-deck sections.
5. Mars non-CryoSleep passengers aged 17-40 with high RoomService or ShoppingMall spending are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22, addressing youth-oriented spending patterns in Martian groups.
6. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet in CryoSleep and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, handling missing origin data with positive cryo transport bias.
7. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 14-16 with any amenity spending over 300 on F deck cabins are likely to be transported if from Earth and destined for TRAPPIST-1e, correcting adolescent spending anomalies.
