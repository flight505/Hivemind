PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 27
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all amenities spending at zero across HomePlanets are likely to be transported, particularly when destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, overriding demographic biases for inactive groups.
2. Young Earth passengers under age 15 not in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins are likely to be transported, enhancing family-dependent transport patterns regardless of destination.
3. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on B, C, D, or A deck cabins are likely to be transported, addressing passive luxury preferences in cryogenic states for elite cabins.
4. Mars passengers under age 25 not in CryoSleep with zero spending on essential amenities like FoodCourt and Spa but high RoomService or VRDeck expenditures on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting youthful spending anomalies.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep over age 50 with all zero spending on G deck cabins are unlikely to be transported when destined for TRAPPIST-1e, prioritizing elder demographic susceptibilities over passive CryoSleep baselines.
6. Passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with combined ShoppingMall and Spa spending exceeding 2000 on E, F, or G decks destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, refining mid-age leisure misalignments.
7. Europa passengers over age 35 with high FoodCourt spending over 2000 and zero RoomService but moderate VRDeck under 50 on A or C decks are unlikely to be transported, balancing luxury indulgences against CryoSleep alternatives.
8. Mars passengers aged 25-40 providing VIP services with RoomService spending over 500 and zero FoodCourt on F decks are unlikely to be transported, adjusting VIP eccentricities in Mars demographics.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-45 with total spending under 100 but positive on any amenity except RoomService destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, supporting conservative spending trends.
10. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet in CryoSleep on C or B decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported when all spending is zero, inferring typical cryogenic behavior for unidentified origins.
11. Young children under age 10 across HomePlanets with all zero spending not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported, generalizing familial priorities over active status.
12. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined luxuries (FoodCourt, Spa, VRDeck) exceeding 5000 on C decks aged 25-35 are likely to be transported, affirming high-wealth transport scenarios.
13. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged over 40 with all zero spending on D or F decks are likely to be transported, mitigating age-related exceptions in cryogenic preferences.
14. Earth passengers aged 15-25 with minimal but non-zero spending primarily on ShoppingMall under 150 on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing adolescent group behaviors.
15. Passengers with VIP status in CryoSleep on elite cabins (A, B, C) are unlikely to be transported when spending exceeds zero on any amenity, prioritizing VIP choices over passive states.
16. Europa passengers under age 30 in CryoSleep on A decks destination TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported even with partial cabin data, addressing cryogenic fidelity in younger elites.
17. Mars passengers aged 30-45 not in CryoSleep with high RoomService spending over 1000 on F decks are unlikely to be transported, generalizing service misuse patterns.
18. Earth passengers over age 45 not in CryoSleep with all zero spending on F decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting overlooked elder familiar ties.
19. Passengers with NaN age in CryoSleep on G decks are likely to be transported when all spending is zero and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, inferring default young behaviors.
20. Combined amenity spending under 50 across all categories for Earth or Mars passengers under 20 on G or F decks not in CryoSleep destined for any planet are likely to be transported, enhancing low-activity youth transports.
