PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 37
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F or E deck cabins with RoomService spending exceeding 500 but total non-zero amenities under 3 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, addressing overgeneralizations in leisure biases for young adults.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on E deck cabins aged 20-25 with VRDeck spending exceeding 1000 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, refining exceptions to spending-based transport trends.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins aged 10-15 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of CryoSleep groups, adjusting familial patterns for very young demographics.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-45 from B or D deck cabins with FoodCourt spending above 500 but VRDeck or Spa exceeding 1000 are unlikely to be transported, mitigating high amenity reversals in mid-life groups.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 35 on C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending above 2000 are likely to be transported if RoomService is non-zero but under 200, countering age-based overgeneralizations in luxury expenditure.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep beyond age 25 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending under 100 but RoomService above 300 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing budget constraints in non-familial contexts.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-25 on E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining youthful leisure patterns over demographic anomalies.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 on D decks with VRDeck spending above 1300 but total spending under 2000 are unlikely to be transported, addressing high-VRDeck outlier biases across destinations.
9. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 45-55 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless VIP or multi-family units, prioritizing resource over baseline CryoSleep tendencies.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on C decks with Spa spending above 2500 but zero RoomService are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, exception to high-spending reversals for targeted luxury.
11. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 20 on F decks with minimal spending (under 50 total) but non-zero VRDeck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating spending misappraisals for younger groups.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-45 on F decks with combined ShoppingMall and RoomService exceeding 1500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting leisure overestimations for mid-life.
13. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on E decks with FoodCourt under 200 but Spa above 200 destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, refining destination anomalies in mixed luxury patterns.
14. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 with all zero spending except FoodCourt under 50 on G decks destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, adjusting passive expenditure trends for older demographics.
