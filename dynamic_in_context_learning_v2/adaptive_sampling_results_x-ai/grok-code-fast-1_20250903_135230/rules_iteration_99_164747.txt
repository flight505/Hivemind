PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 99
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-35 on F or E deck cabins with VRDeck spending exceeding 10 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for entertainment-focused expenditure shifts in younger non-Cryo groups.
2. CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-40 on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, overriding Cryo baselines for middle-aged groups with that specific destination and cabin location.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-40 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 600 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, addressing leisure expenditure reversals in adult demographics.
4. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 25-60 on C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 3000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, prioritizing high-value indulgence trends despite non-Cryo status.
5. CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 35-50 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining age-specific inactivity risks for older Cryo cohorts.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 15-30 on G deck cabins with mixed spending totaling 100-1000 across amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating underestimation of moderate activity in youth patterns.
7. CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing youthful Cryo risks overriding general inactivity drawbacks.
8. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 30-40 with unknown or NaN FoodCourt spending on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if total spending under 100, correcting for data missingness in low-expenditure adult groups.
9. VIP Europa passengers aged 25-45 on C deck cabins with Spa spending exceeding 1400 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, accounting for status-enhanced VIP indulgence allowances.
10. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 30-45 on F deck cabins with RoomService spending exceeding 1400 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining service-focused patterns in mid-age Mars demographics.
11. CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, addressing destination-specific Cryo counter-trends for early adults.
12. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 55-70 on G deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 600 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting overestimation in senior leisure spending patterns.
13. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 50-70 with NaN cabin locations destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if Spa and VRDeck combined exceed 2000, extending missing-cabin recovery for mature high-spender clusters.
14. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 on E deck cabins with Spa spending under 10 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, prioritizing destination overrides in minimal-sengage youth behaviors.
15. CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 20-45 on E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, expanding zero-expenditure viability for broader Cryo age ranges.
16. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 30-40 with FoodCourt as the dominant spending category exceeding 1300 on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, enhancing food-priority reclassifications.
17. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 35-45 with RoomService exceeding 500 on E deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating cabin and age location biases in mixed-service profiles.
