PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 40
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with combined FoodCourt and VRDeck spending exceeding 100 are likely to be transported, emphasizing active spending patterns in younger to middle-aged demographics.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 2000 and total spending under 2500 on F deck cabins are likely to be transported, highlighting leisure-focused expenditure in young adult groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 and combined Spa plus VRDeck spending under 400 are likely to be transported, prioritizing high discretionary spending patterns regardless of cabin deck.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 40 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, refining baseline expectations for solitary CryoSleep states.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Mars aged 30-45 with total spending 200-2000 on F or G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if FoodCourt or ShoppingMall exceeds 100, countering low-activity assumptions in moderate spender groups.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50+ with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1500 and zero to low RoomService on A or C deck cabins are likely to be transported when destination is 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e, addressing outlier high-expenditure patterns in older demographics.
7. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 30+ on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating overly aspirational predictions for middle-aged CryoSleep without familial indicators.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 25 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 with combined FoodCourt and VRDeck spending under 500 are consistently likely to be transported, reinforcing youth mobility patterns.
9. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa with RoomService under 500 and FoodCourt exceeding 2000 across A, B, or C deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, focusing on luxury amenity preferences in active-spending profiles.
10. Earth or Mars non-CryoSleep passengers aged 35-50 on D or F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with total spending 50-500 excluding VRDeck are likely to be transported if no single amenity exceeds 2500, adjusting for balanced moderation in transporting trends.
11. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-40 on B or C deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with VRDeck spending under 50 and FoodCourt over 3000 are likely to be transported, refining cabin-based activity levels for younger enthusiasts.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-45 on D deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with combined ShoppingMall and FoodCourt under 2500 but positive in both are likely to be transported, correcting underestimation of moderate dual-spending behaviors.
