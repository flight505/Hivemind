PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 21
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService expenditure over 500 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing this over moderate amenity usage patterns when age is above 30.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with combined Spa and VRDeck spending exceeding 600, regardless of other amenities, are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing destination-independent behavior for non-CryoSleep cases.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep but aged 30 and above on G deck cabins are unlikely to be transported, especially when all amenity spending is zero and destination is PSO J318.5-22.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A deck cabins with total spending under 100 and age over 35 are unlikely to be transported, overriding VIP status effects.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 25 with significant RoomService or VRDeck spending exceeding 400 but minimal FoodCourt usage are unlikely to be transported.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under age 30 with high ShoppingMall spending over 500 are unlikely to be transported, focusing on young adult non-CryoSleep trends.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 20 on G deck cabins with all zero spending and non-TRAPPIST destinations are unlikely to be transported.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from B or C decks with FoodCourt and Spa combined over 3000 and zero RoomService are likely to be transported; however, if from A deck and spending drops below 100, likelihood decreases.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa under 1000 but over 100, aged 20-40, are likely to be transported if cabin is F deck, counterbalancing low total spending biases.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with VRDeck spending between 700 and 2000, independent of other spending, are unlikely to be transported, particularly for middle-aged demographics.
11. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities but aged under 15 are likely to be transported, reinforcing family group patterns.
12. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with partial zero spending (e.g., RoomService missing but others zero) on G deck are unlikely to be transported if age is under 30 or destination is Cancri.
13. Europa passengers from A or C decks not in CryoSleep with zero spending and age over 35 are unlikely to be transported, regardless of VIP status.
14. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending under 200 but RoomService above 100 are likely to be transported if cabin is G deck, addressing mid-range spending exceptions.
15. Mars or Earth passengers under age 5 in CryoSleep on G deck are unlikely to be transported if destination is non-TRAPPIST and all spending is zero.
