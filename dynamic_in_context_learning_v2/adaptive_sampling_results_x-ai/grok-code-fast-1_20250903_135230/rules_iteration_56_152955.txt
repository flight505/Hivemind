PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 56
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 18 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, addressing youthful demographic dependencies in passive travel states.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep on E or F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 and combined RoomService and VRDeck spending under 700 are likely to be transported if age between 18 and 30, mitigating youthful leisure-based anomalies.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A or B decks with FoodCourt spending above 2000 and age over 50 are likely to be transported, countering high-expenditure reversals in older demographics.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on E, F, or G decks with non-zero spending in FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, or VRDeck and age between 14 and 30 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, refining low-activity patterns in active travel.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with mixed spending (non-zero in at least two non-RoomService amenities) and age over 15 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported if total spending exceeds 700, targeting diverse expenditure reversals.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep over age 40 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing demographic exceptions in uniform passive patterns.
