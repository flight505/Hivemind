PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 25
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age over 50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing demographic and destination anomalies over passive CryoSleep baselines.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, overriding low activity expectations for young demographics.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt and Spa combined spending exceeding 2500 are unlikely to be transported, addressing high luxury expenditure reversals in mid-life groups regardless of other amenities.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, mitigating youthful demographic biases.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering overgeneralizations in CryoSleep transport likelihoods.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1200 are likely to be transported if total non-ShoppingMall spending remains under 100, emphasizing young adult leisure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService and VRDeck spending under 10 but FoodCourt above 2000 are unlikely to be transported, refining high-spending outlier behaviors.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing familial or dependent group transport tendencies.
9. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are generally likely to be transported, unless they are Europa passengers with high FoodCourt spending over 500 from A or B decks, reflecting cryo-saving anomalies.
10. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported, regardless of deck or age, overriding deck-specific limits for familial transport tendencies.
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are less likely to be transported if aged under 15 on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22, prioritizing developmental anomalies in crude cryo protocols.
12. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported, emphasizing elite cryo efficiency patterns.
13. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on D or E decks with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 800 and total spend under 1000 are likely to be transported, expanding youth leisure-driven transport.
14. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 55 on B or A decks with total spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported despite luxury reversals, correcting mid-life spend pattern biases.
15. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported, assuming standard cryo passenger baselines.
