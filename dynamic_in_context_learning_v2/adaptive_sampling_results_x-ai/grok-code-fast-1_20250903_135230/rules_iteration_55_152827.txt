PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 55
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 1500, regardless of other amenities, are likely to be transported, addressing common high expenditure reversals in active mid-adult groups across absurdity destinations.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 25 with total spending exceeding 1000, particularly in ShoppingMall, are likely to be transported if non-zero activity is present, countering low-spend assumptions for young demographics.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 15 with all zero spending on G or F decks destined for PSO J318.5-22 or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, strengthening familial dependency patterns over default CryoSleep baselines.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 30 from F or D decks with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported unless part of larger group patterns, refining youthful inertia biases.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A, B, or C decks aged 30-50 with Spa and VRDeck combined spending over 2000 are likely to be transported, prioritizing elite leisure consumption trends.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 40 on F decks with RoomService zero and VRDeck above 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, adjusting for elderly entertainment diversion patterns.
7. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged over 40 from any deck with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating overreliance on CryoSleep for senior groups.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-40 from E or F decks with ShoppingMall spending over 1000 and other amenities under 100 are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, enhancing shopping-focused revival tendencies.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 with total spending under 50 but VRDeck spending above 500 on F decks are likely to be transported, countering low-activity curtailments in middle-aged subsets.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with VIP status aged 35-45 from B decks with FoodCourt above 2500 and VRDeck nonzero are likely to be transported, addressing VIP elite redirection patterns.
