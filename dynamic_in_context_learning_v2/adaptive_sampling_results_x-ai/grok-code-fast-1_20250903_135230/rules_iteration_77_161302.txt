PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 77
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-40 on E or G deck cabins with ShoppingMall or FoodCourt spending between 200-1000 and VRDeck under 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining moderate expenditure patterns that enhance transport odds in young to middle-aged active groups despite non-Cryo status.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 1000 combined with VRDeck exceeding 300 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, limiting high-concentration amenity spending that reduces transport likelihood in youthful insert groups.
3. Earth passengers with unknown CryoSleep status but all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, treating zero-activity profiles as indicative of CryoSleep-equivalent immobilization for inter-system travel.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 50-60 on G deck cabins with ShoppingMall exceeding 700 and total spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending midele leisure-driven spending cues for older demographics not on E or F decks.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-25 on E deck cabins with combined FoodCourt and RoomService under 1000 but partial VRDeck or Spa activity destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing low-to-moderate youth activity thresholds in E deck non-Cryo scenarios.
