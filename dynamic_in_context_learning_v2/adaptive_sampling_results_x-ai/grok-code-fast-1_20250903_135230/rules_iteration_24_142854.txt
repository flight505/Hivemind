PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 24
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age over 50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing demographic and destination anomalies over passive CryoSleep baselines.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, overriding low activity expectations for young demographics.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt and Spa combined spending exceeding 2500 are unlikely to be transported, addressing high luxury expenditure reversals in mid-life groups regardless of other amenities.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, mitigating youthful demographic biases.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering overgeneralizations in CryoSleep transport likelihoods.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1200 are likely to be transported if total non-ShoppingMall spending remains under 100, emphasizing young adult leisure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService and VRDeck spending under 10 but FoodCourt above 2000 are unlikely to be transported, refining high-spending outlier behaviors.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing familial or dependent group transport tendencies.
