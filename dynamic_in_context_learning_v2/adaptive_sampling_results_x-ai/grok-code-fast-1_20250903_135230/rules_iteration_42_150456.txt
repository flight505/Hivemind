PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 42
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 16-40 on G or F deck cabins with total spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, addressing overprediction in young to middle-aged low-activity groups.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on E, F, or G deck cabins with RoomService spending exceeding 500 are unlikely to be transported, correcting biases in moderate to high RoomService expenditure patterns among active adults.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-55 on C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 3000 are likely to be transported, refining transport likelihood for high-food-focused affluent middle-age demographics.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 16-30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, adjusting age thresholds from under 15 to include 16-30 for better anomaly detection.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, incorporating multi-passenger family indicators to mitigate isolated demographic biases.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on D deck cabins with VRDeck spending exceeding 5000 are unlikely to be transported, addressing outlier reversals in luxury VR entertainment expenditures.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50-65 with NaN cabins and low but non-zero spending on VRDeck or Spa destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, preempting false positives in older specific amenity use.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 and minimal other amenities are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing leisure pattern disruptions in mid-adulthood.
