PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 23
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth or Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with high RoomService spending exceeding 500, regardless of other amenities, are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing this over low or moderate total spending patterns for non-CryoSleep cases.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending exceeding 5000 are unlikely to be transported, overriding rules for combined spending in specific amenities like Spa and VRDeck.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with VRDeck spending exceeding 400 and minimal FoodCourt usage are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing spending imbalances in amenity choices.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 with moderate RoomService or ShoppingMall spending between 1 and 1000, exclusive of high Spa, are more likely to be transported than previously predicted.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported if age is between 20 and 40 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, tempering cabin-specific biases.
6. Europan passengers not in CryoSleep from A or C decks with zero spending and age exceeding 35, independent of VIP status, are unlikely to be transported.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with combined Spa and ShoppingMall spending under 500 but over 50, aged 19-45, are unlikely to be transported if on F or G decks.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService over 1000, regardless of cabin deck, are unlikely to be transported, focusing on expenditure-driven non-transport trends.
9. Passengers with unknown CryoSleep status (NaN) and moderate total spending under 500 are more likely to not be transported if from Earth on F deck to non-TRAPPIST destinations.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService but high Spa and VRDeck combined over 2000 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing zero RoomService in high-spend contexts.
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck aged under 25 with zero spending to PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, overriding potential age-related biases.
12. Mars or Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt zero but moderate VRDeck over 200 and RoomService under 10 are likely to be transported if aged 10-15.
13. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on E deck with high Spa spending over 500 and low total spending are unlikely to be transported.
14. Europan passengers not in CryoSleep on A deck with zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported if age exceeds 35.
15. Earth passengers with CryoSleep NaN and all zero spending on G deck are unlikely to be transported if destination is 55 Cancri e.
