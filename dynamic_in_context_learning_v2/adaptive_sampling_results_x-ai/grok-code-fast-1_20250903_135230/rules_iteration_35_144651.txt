PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 35
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 10-30 on any deck except A or B with any non-zero spending in ShoppingMall or Spa under 1000 are likely to be transported, addressing underestimations in youthful spending behaviors despite destination.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from B deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, countering low activity assumptions in upper ship sections for mid-life demographics.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 13-40 on E or F decks with total spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported if RoomService is over 100, refining expenditure-based transport likelihoods for active younger adults.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins destined for 55 Cancri e with all zero spending are likely to be transported, mitigating destination-specific biases in zero-spend youth groups.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of documented family groups, correcting overgeneralizations in CryoSleep likelihoods for solitary individuals.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 30-40 on E or F decks with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing age-related exceptions to CryoSleep baselines independent of multi-passenger units.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-40 on D, E, or F decks destined for 55 Cancri e with ShoppingMall spending over 700 and other amenities under 100 are likely to be transported, addressing high-leisure focus reversals in adult demographic patterns.
8. Passengers with missing cabin information not in CryoSleep aged 20-25 from any home planet with any amenity spending over 50 are likely to be transported, generalizing transport tendencies for unidentified location youth despite activity levels.
9. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 15 on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are likely to be transported unless family unit co-travelers exceed 3, refining low-age CryoSleep transport rules across all decks.</policy>
