PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 69
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged under 15 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation of low-activity juvenile patterns in Earth's lower decks.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 40-50 on G deck cabins with RoomService exceeding 500 but other amenities low destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting middle-aged spending concentration risks in non-luxury sections.
3. CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-15 or unknown age on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, overriding zero-expenditure assumptions for uncertain or adolescent inactive states.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 60-70 on any deck with all amenities under 20 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining senior non-Cryo inactivity predictors across cabins.
5. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 25-35 on upper deck cabins like A/B with combined FoodCourt, Spa, and VRDeck spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting wealthy Europan youth amenity usage patterns.
6. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with total spending under 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending teenage-like activity thresholds to young adult Martians.
7. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 55-65 on any deck with no high-transaction amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, elevating mature Europan non-Cryo priorities over baseline inactivity metrics.
8. CryoSleep Earth passengers on G deck cabins with unknown VIP status and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, constraining cryogenic prediction confidence for incomplete profiles.
9. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 5-10 on G deck cabins with all amenities zero destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, targeting child-centric transport signals in early colonies.
