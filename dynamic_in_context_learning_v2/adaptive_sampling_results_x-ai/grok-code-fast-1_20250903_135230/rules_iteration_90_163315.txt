PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 90
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across all homeplanets are likely to be transported, refining inactivity thresholds to prioritize universal CryoSleep conservation patterns regardless of cabin location or age.
2. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa or Mars with total spending under 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing low-expenditure overrides in these homeworld groups for mid-range destinations.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-40 with positive spending on FoodCourt exceeding 500 or ShoppingMall exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, enhancing youth-adult consumption-driven transport likelihoods.
4. Passengers from Europa in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, extending high-priority cryogenic patterns for this homeplanet-destination combination.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for overlooked colony-specific inactivity transport tendencies.
6. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 30-50 from Europa with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, refining middle-aged luxury expenditure correlations.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing destination-specific inactivity overrides for Earth demographics.
8. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers with total spending under 300 and destination TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating low-activity biases in new colony-bound groups.
