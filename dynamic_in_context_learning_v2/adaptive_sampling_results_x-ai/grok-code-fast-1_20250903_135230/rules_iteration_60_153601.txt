PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 60
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are likely to be transported, overriding general inactivity assumptions for higher-tier cabins and various ages.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under age 15 with zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, correcting overreliance on familial ties for very young demographics.
3. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending from unknown or missing HomePlanet and G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if aged under 20, prioritizing CryoSleep consistency over destination anomalies.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep over age 45 with zero spending on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, countering CryoSleep transport biases for mid-life adults.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep over age 40 with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, enhancing recognition of demographic patterns in low-activity Mars travelers.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero spending in premium A or C deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported regardless of age, refining low-spending outlier behaviors in luxury sections.
7. Non-CryoSleep passengers with significant ShoppingMall spending combined with below-average other amenities, aged 20-50 from various planets and E or F decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, are likely to be transported if total spending remains moderate.
8. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported when cabin is on G deck, addressing destination-specific transport tendencies in younger demographics.
