PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 76
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 18 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to not be transported, adjusting age thresholds for child CryoSleep groups to reflect higher risk despite zero-activity baselines.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-40 on F or G deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 but low other amenities destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, correcting for isolated high-shopping patterns in young adult non-Cryo demographics.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 30-50 on F or G deck cabins with total spending under 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining low-expenditure thresholds for middle-aged groups despite non-Cryo status.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 0-10 with unknown or G deck cabins and zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to not be transported, overriding zero-spending Cryo baselines for young children to indicate higher transport resistance.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if RoomService is low, adjusting for low-income family patterns in youth non-Cryo segments.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 45-60 on A deck cabins with Spa spending exceeding 1000 destined for 55 Cancri e and VIP status are likely to be transported, emphasizing high-spending VIP anomalies despite non-Cryo for senior Europa groups.
7. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are less likely to be transported, calibrating zero-spending Cryo patterns for young adult Mars travelers to reduce over-prediction risks.
8. Earth passengers with unknown CryoSleep (treating as non-Cryo) aged 15-25 on G deck cabins and zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if no VIP status, correcting missing Cryo variables for adolescent low-activity Earth cohorts.
9. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 40-60 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing food-expenditure reversals in mature non-Cryo demographics.
10. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-35 with unknown cabin locations and mixed low-high amenities under 1000 total destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, enhancing cabin-missing corrections for variable spending in young adult groups.
