PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 38
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 from any deck with non-zero spending in RoomService, FoodCourt, or combination thereof destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for active lifestyle patterns in mature demographics.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 from F deck cabins with RoomService spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, emphasizing late-life activity reversals.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with CryoSleep status NaN (unknown) and all zero spending aged under 15 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, prioritizing youthful demographic dependencies despite incomplete cryo data.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 30-60 from E or F deck cabins with combined Spa and VRDeck spending exceeding 400 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, countering over-restrictive spending thresholds in mid-adult non-cryo groups.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-30 from G or F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported unless accompanied by family indicators, refining solo adult cryo expectations.
6. Europa passengers with CryoSleep status NaN (unknown), all zero spending, and S deck cabins aged over 35 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing passive budget priorities in unknown cryo mid-life Europa residents.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 from G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are overgeneralized in current rules; instead, prioritize if ShoppingMall spending is present, but they remain moderately likely unless extreme youth deviation occurs.
8. Passengers from any home planet with CryoSleep status NaN (unknown), zero spending, and missing cabin data but aged 50+ destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, balancing uncertainty with destination affinity for mature ages.
