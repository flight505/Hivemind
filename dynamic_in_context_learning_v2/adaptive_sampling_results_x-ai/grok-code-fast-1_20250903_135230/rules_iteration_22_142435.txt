PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 22
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero amenity spending are likely to be transported if age is under 25 and destination is non-TRAPPIST, overriding general non-TRAPPIST biases for older demographics.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with combined RoomService and VRDeck spending between 200 and 600 are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing middle-age patterns regardless of minor FoodCourt or ShoppingMall usage.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending over 1000 but zero in at least RoomService and FoodCourt are unlikely to be transported, highlighting resource allocation disparities.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from B or C decks with VRDeck spending over 1500 are unlikely to be transported, regardless of combined Spa and FoodCourt values.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero amenity spending are unlikely to be transported if age is over 35 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, adjusting for adult non-engagement trends.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService and FoodCourt spending but high ShoppingMall or Spa usage are likely to be transported if aboard B deck cabins.
7. Mars passengers under age 30 not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported, reinforcing discretionary activity requirements.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-30 with SpendingMall exceeding 500 but low VRDeck are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing entertainment over transit needs.
9. Europa passengers from A decks not in CryoSleep with total spending under 50 and age over 35 are unlikely to be transported, countering low-engagement expectations for VIP overrides.
10. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with partial zero spending (e.g., RoomService or VRDeck only) on non-G decks are likely to be transported, focusing on cabin diversity for younger groups.
11. Earth passengers aged 30-60 not in CryoSleep with VRDeck spending between 700 and 2000 and zero RoomService are unlikely to be transported, underscoring amenity habit discrepancies.
12. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa over 2000 from D decks are likely to be transported, bypassing general high-spending reluctance patterns.
13. Mars passengers aged over 35 in CryoSleep on E or F decks with all zero spending are likely to be transported if from family groups, emphasizing group solidarity effects.
14. Earth passengers under age 20 in CryoSleep on G decks with non-TRAPPIST destinations and zero spending are likely to be transported, refining age-specific transport propensities.
15. Europa passengers from C decks not in CryoSleep with zero VRDeck and ShoppingMall but high FoodCourt are unlikely to be transported, highlighting destination-agnostic consumption imbalances.
