PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 96
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 0-9 or 18-35 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if homeplanet and age are consistent with demographic survival trends, refining youth and early adult patterns in low-activity Earth groups.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 0-10 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation of inert young demographics despite non-Cryo status.
3. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 0-15 on A or B deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing high-priority overriding for infant-toddler age groups in premium Europa cabins.
4. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 0-15 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending survival patterns for young Mars families in forward sections.
5. CryoSleep passengers aged 3-5 or 20-35 from Earth on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e, PSO J318.5-22, or 55 Cancri e may not be transported, correcting overuse of CryoSleep generalities for mid-range age groups with cabin-specific risks.
6. CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 40-50 on E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e may not be transported, mitigating over-reliance on planet-wide inactivity preservation in middle-aged cases.
7. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with total spending 700-1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining moderate expenditure thresholds that indicate viability in active young adult patterns.
8. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-25 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 3000 and other amenities under 100 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, emphasizing food-centric high-spending anomalies in youth-focused trips.
9. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 25-30 on A deck cabins with ShoppingMall exceeding 4000 and other amenities under 50 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting luxury shopping reversals in adult Europa groups.
10. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 25-30 on G deck cabins with RoomService under 200 and total spending 600-800 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing service-balanced activity patterns in transitional age demographics.
11. CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 50-65 with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e may not be transported if high-service amenities are absent, correcting senior age biases when activity drops below thresholds.
12. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers with unknown cabins aged 35-50 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported if VIP status is false, refining missing-cabin variables for mid-age non-wealthy groups.
