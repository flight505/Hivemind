PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with cabin decks E or F are more likely to be transported if they are young (under 20), while those on deck G in CryoSleep are less likely, especially if over 30.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate total spending (200-1000) on multiple amenities, particularly ShoppingMall and Spa, are more likely to be transported if age is below 30.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with low spending and age under 20 are more likely to be transported, regardless of cabin deck, overriding previous unlikely predictions.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high spending (over 2000) primarily in FoodCourt or VRDeck are more likely to be transported if age is 20-40 and cabin starts with B.
5. Passengers heading to 55 Cancri e not in CryoSleep with spending on FoodCourt exceeding 700 or total amenities 500-1500 are more likely to be transported if from Earth and age 20-35.
6. Non-VIP passengers from Earth in CryoSleep on deck G with age over 30 are unlikely to be transported, correcting overpredictions for older adults.
7. Passengers from Mars with cabin decks F and low total spending (under 50) not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if age under 15.
8. Earth passengers with missing cabins and low spending not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if age under 15 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e.
