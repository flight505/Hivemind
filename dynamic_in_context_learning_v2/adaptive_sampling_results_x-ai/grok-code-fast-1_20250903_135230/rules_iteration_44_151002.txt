PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 44
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if aged over 50, adjusting for demographic anomalies in elderly CryoSleep groups.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported regardless of age or cabin deck, refuting assumptions of CryoSleep transport reliability across alternative destinations.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 2000 on A, C, or E decks are likely to be transported, countering high-expenditure patterns in luxury-oriented demographics.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-45 on F or G deck cabins with moderate to low total spending on any amenities destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, enhancing middle-age activity tendencies.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on G decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, tempering youthful CryoSleep expectations in economy-focused sections.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 20 on F or G deck cabins with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported unless in multi-passenger groups, recognizing family isolation as a risk factor.
7. Europa passengers with NaN CryoSleep status and high FoodCourt spending exceeding 3000 on C decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, accounting for assumption overrides in high-spending non-Cryo groups.
8. VIP passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep on A decks with combined ShoppingMall and FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for VIP luxury biases.
9. Earth passengers aged under 5 not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, limiting overoptimistic family transport patterns for infants.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 60 or older with zero RoomService and high Spa spending on C decks are unlikely to be transported, refining elderly luxury expenditure reversals.
