PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 93
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-55 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, correcting over-predictions for inactive non-Cryo overriders in young to middle-aged Earth's home destination group.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 30-40 on F or G deck cabins with combined spending on FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing under-predictions from moderate multi-amenity activity across Earth demographics.
3. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers aged 20-30 on C deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 3000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining Europa's high-spending exceptions in premium cabins for young adults.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-5 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing very young Mars groups despite non-Cryo inactivity baselines.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-45 on F deck cabins with positive spending across at least two amenities under 1000 each destined for unknown destinations are likely to be transported, mitigating under-predictions in missing-destination non-Cryo spending patterns.
