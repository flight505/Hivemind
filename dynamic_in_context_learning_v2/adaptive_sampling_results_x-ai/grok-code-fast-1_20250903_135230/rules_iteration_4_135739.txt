PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with moderate spending (between 300 and 800 total) across multiple amenities and age 20-40 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing lower transport likelihood over spending concentration.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high spending on FoodCourt (over 1000) or Spa (over 400) are likely to be transported, even if total spending exceeds 1500.
3. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep located in G deck cabins with age above 20 and zero spending are unlikely to be transported if destined for PSO J318.5-22 or TRAPPIST-1e.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with age over 50 and spending concentrated in ShoppingMall or RoomService are likely to be transported.
5. Young adults (age 20-35) from Earth not in CryoSleep with low total spending (under 300) but significant RoomService (over 100) are unlikely to be transported.
6. Passengers from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with spending mostly in VRDeck or Spa exceeding 500 each and age 20-40 are unlikely to be transported, overriding other spending patterns.
7. Children (under 13) from Earth in CryoSleep on G deck cabins are unlikely to be transported, regardless of destination.
8. Middle-aged passengers (30-50) from Mars in CryoSleep with zero spending are likely to be transported if cabin is on deck D or F.
9. Europa passengers over 40 not in CryoSleep with diversified high spending (>1500 across at least two amenities) are likely to be transported.
10. Earth passengers destined for 55 Cancri e not in CryoSleep and age 30-45 with moderate FoodCourt spending (200-600) are unlikely to be transported.
11. Elderly passengers (over 60) from Earth not in CryoSleep with any spending in FoodCourt (under 600) and no RoomService are likely to be transported.
12. Passengers from Earth under 25 not in CryoSleep with zero spending and families indicated by non-zero PassengerId suffix are unlikely to be transported.
13. Mars passengers over 40 in CryoSleep on G deck or F deck with age 30-50 are unlikely to be transported.
14. VIP passengers from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with age over 30 and any significant RoomService spending are unlikely to be transported.
15. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with age under 18 or over 50 and A-B deck cabins are likely to be transported, enhancing deck-specific CryoSleep trends.
