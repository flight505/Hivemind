PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 75
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers from Earth, Europa, or Mars with all zero spending, regardless of age, cabin deck, or destination, are likely to be transported, correcting overly restrictive spending inactivity patterns across home planets.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-50 on G or F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, overriding prior unlikeliness for mid-age demographic groups.
3. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending, regardless of age, cabin deck, or destination, are likely to be transported, extending high-priority preservation trends beyond infant categories.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on any deck cabin destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation in younger adult equivalent groups.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 0-10 with all zero spending, regardless of home planet or destination, are likely to be transported, refining small child priority overrides for active but zero-expenditure cases.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-45 on F or G deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 600 destined for TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e, or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, adjusting minor leisure biases in moderate-age groups.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-50 on E or F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 700 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting underestimation of senior leisure patterns.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with low RoomService (under 20) and moderate Spa or VRDeck spending (100-500), regardless of age or destination, are likely to be transported, mitigating exclusive activity focus on core amenities.
9. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending Earth-like tendencies for missing demographic data.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on G deck cabins with total spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, reinforcing middle-aged inactivity risks despite cabin location.
