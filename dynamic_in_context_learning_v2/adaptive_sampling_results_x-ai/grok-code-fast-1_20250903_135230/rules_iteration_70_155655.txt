PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 70
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers from Mars or Europa with all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, overriding inactivity biases in non-Earth groups regardless of age or cabin deck.
2. CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 18-60 with all zero spending are likely to be transported if on F deck cabins, correcting deck-specific transport patterns in mature demographic Cryo subgroups.
3. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending between 100-200 and low overall spending under 500 are likely to be transported, emphasizing youth food expenditure anomalies.
4. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, accounting for missing origin data in zero-activity Cryo scenarios.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 15-25 with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, refining adolescent inactivity trends in non-Cryo Earth groups.
6. CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 0-5 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported if on G deck cabins, opposing general Cryo trends for very young Earth demographics on lower decks.
7. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Mars in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending zero-activity Mars patterns to Cryo active youth-equivalent groups.
8. CryoSleep passengers from Europa aged 20-50 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing high-risk overrides in mid-age Europa Cryo inactivity cases.
9. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 25-35 on G deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 700 and FoodCourt under 50 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, highlighting mid-age leisure-focused Earth spending reversals.
10. CryoSleep passengers from Mars aged 20-50 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if on F deck cabins, addressing deck-specific Mars Cryo transport likelihoods.
11. Passengers from Europa in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, generalizing Europa Cryo patterns for alternate destination transport.
12. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Mars aged 18-40 on E or G deck cabins with unknown destination and FoodCourt spending under 2000 are likely to be transported if VIP status is true, increasing transport odds for VIP anomalies.
13. CryoSleep passengers from Europa aged 15-30 with all zero spending and unknown cabin locations are likely to be transported, correcting cabin-missing biases in young Europa Cryo groups.
14. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 20-40 on G deck cabins with total spending between 1000-5000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, countering moderate spending illusions in mature Earth non-Cryo demographics.
15. Passengers from Mars in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported regardless of age or cabin, emphasizing Mars Cryo high-transport tendencies for distant destinations.
