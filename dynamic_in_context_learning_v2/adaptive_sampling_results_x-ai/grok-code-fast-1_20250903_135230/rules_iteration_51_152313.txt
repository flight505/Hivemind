PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 51
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, overriding any previously low-activity assumptions.
2. Passengers from Mars in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age over 25 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating age-related biases in CryoSleep demographics.
3. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep aged 18-50 with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 and RoomService at zero destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing moderate leisure spending patterns.
4. Passengers from Mars in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age under 40 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported unless in B or C deck cabins.
5. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep aged under 30 with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, countering baseline age thresholds for non-activity.
6. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep aged over 35 with FoodCourt spending above 2000 and combined Spa and VRDeck spending under 50 are likely to be transported if on A or C decks.
7. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep aged under 15 with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, overriding family or group expectations.
8. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 with ShoppingMall spending above 500 and total spending across other amenities under 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported.
9. Passengers from Europa in CryoSleep with all zero spending and VIP status as false destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, irrespective of age ranges.
10. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep aged 3-10 with all zero spending on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining very young demographic transport tendencies.
