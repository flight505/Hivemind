PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending over 1000 and RoomService spending under 100 are likely to be transported, overriding general low-spending patterns.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending over 1000 and RoomService spending at zero are likely to be transported, particularly if on B or C deck cabins.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported if age is under 25 or over 40, adjusting for demographic outliers in CryoSleep groups.
4. Earth passengers under age 16 not in CryoSleep with zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, focusing on child protection and relocation patterns.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-35 with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending over 500 are likely to be transported, correcting underestimation in moderate spending scenarios.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending are unlikely to be transported if age is over 40, addressing inconsistencies in older Mars CryoSleep demographics.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined VRDeck and Spa spending over 1000 and low RoomService are likely to be transported, prioritizing dining and leisure-heavy patterns.  
8. Young adult passengers (18-30) from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with VRDeck spending over 500 and low combined FoodCourt and RoomService are likely to be transported, overriding low spending assumptions.
9. Earth passengers on G deck cabins in CryoSleep with age 30-50 and zero spending are likely to be transported only if HomePlanet is Earth or Mars, distinguishing by planet-specific CryoSleep effectiveness.
10. Passengers destined to 55 Cancri e not in CryoSleep with any single amenity spending over 1000 are likely to be transported, especially for Europa and Mars groups enabling luxury destination trends.
