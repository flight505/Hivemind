PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 28
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) are unlikely to be transported unless they are young adults (ages 18-30) traveling to PSO J318.5-22, prioritizing CryoSleep as a primary transport indicator for non-exceptional cases.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 2500 are likely to be transported, overriding general high-expenditure biases toward non-transport when on A or C decks and not VIP-flagged.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on E, F, or G decks with nonzero but moderate FoodCourt spending (1000-2500) and minimal other amenities are likely to be transported, enhancing patterns for young demographic spending habits.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 40 with all zero spending are likely to be transported regardless of deck location or destination (except PSO J318.5-22 for ages 18-30), countering youthful Zero-activity assumptions.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 25 from A or B decks with high VRDeck spending (above 2000) and no RoomService are unlikely to be transported, refining mid-age luxury outlier reversals.
6. Passengers under age 15 in CryoSleep or with all zero spending on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing familial child protection patterns across home planets.
7. Europa passengers aged 25-40 not in CryoSleep with high FoodCourt only (below 6000) and zero Spa/VRDeck on C decks are likely to be transported, adjusting for selective amenity preferences in mid-life.

1. Passengers aged 50+ in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reversing demographic biases for older groups.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on F decks with ShoppingMall spending above 1000 and total non-ShoppingMall spending under 200 are unlikely to be transported, mitigating youthful leisure spending anomalies.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under 20 with all zero spending on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, bolstering youth and dependency transport tendencies.
