PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 71
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all amenities (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) at zero spending are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth, Mars, Europa, or unknown, particularly destined for TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e, or PSO J318.5-22.
2. Young passengers (aged 0-17) are likely to be transported regardless of CryoSleep status, especially if HomePlanet is Earth or Mars, with low or zero spending on amenities, and destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
3. Non-CryoSleep passengers with significant spending on a single amenity (e.g., RoomService >1000, ShoppingMall >1000, or VRDeck >1000) are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth and destined for 55 Cancri e.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with aggregated spending exceeding 4000 across all amenities are likely to be transported, especially if VIP status is True and cabin is on A or B decks.
5. Passengers aged 18-30 not in CryoSleep with spending under 1000 on all amenities except one exceeding 500 are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth, on F or G decks, and destined for TRAPPIST-1e.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e, overriding any unknown age or partial spending inconsistencies.
7. Passengers with unknown cabin locations and all zero spending aged 18-50 are likely to be transported if CryoSleep is True, regardless of HomePlanet variations for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e destinations.
8. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 40-60 with total spending under 1000 but isolated high spending in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth, aiding moderate family groups destined for TRAPPIST-1e.
9. Europa or unknown HomePlanet passengers in CryoSleep аж with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, enhancing prioritization for high-status origin groups.
10. Young adult passengers (aged 20-30) from Earth or otherwise Mars not in CryoSleep with VRDeck or Spa spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported if on F decks, supporting entertainment-driven transports to TRAPPIST-1e.
11. Passengers over 50 years old from Europa or Mars in CryoSleep with zero spending are likely to be transported regardless of deck, addressing mid-life transport priorities.
12. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged under 25 with FoodCourt spending over 500 and other amenities under 100 are likely to be transported, focusing on youth nutrition patterns to PSO J318.5-22 or TRAPPIST-1e.
13. Passengers with VIP status False but high-total spending (>2000) across amenities are likely pokry to be transported if not in CryoSleep from Earth, countering status bias in wealthy groups to 55 Cancri e.
14. Infants and toddlers (aged 0-5) from any HomePlanet with low spending are likely to be transported, adjusting for family unit protection considerations regardless of CryoSleep or destination variations.
15. Passengers in CryoSleep on F decks with all zero spending are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Mars and destined for TRAPPIST-1e, refining cryonic deck patterns outside Earth baseline.
