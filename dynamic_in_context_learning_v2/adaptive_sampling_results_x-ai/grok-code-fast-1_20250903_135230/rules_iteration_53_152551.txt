PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 53
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers not in CryoSleep with any non-zero RoomService spending are unlikely to be transported, reflecting passive activity reducing transport likelihood across all HomePlanets.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 13-30 with combined spending on Spa and VRDeck exceeding 300 are unlikely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, addressing underestimated risks in recreational spending patterns.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep on F deck cabins with non-zero spending in RoomService or ShoppingMall are unlikely to be transported, mitigating overestimations in expenditure-driven transport rates.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A, B, or D decks with total spending exceeding 1000 (excluding zero values) are unlikely to be transported, refining luxury demographic reversals.
5. Passengers not in CryoSleep with missing or NaN destination and non-zero RoomService spending aged 20-40 are unlikely to be transported, correcting for uncertainty in destination-specific trends.
6. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 25 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing destination anomalies over general CryoSleep benefits.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-45 with VRDeck spending above 0 are unlikely to be transported if total other amenities spending is low, emphasizing isolated leisure activity risks.
8. Passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 200 but RoomService above 500 are unlikely to be transported, balancing sustenance and service expenditure patterns.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on F or G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e with overall low but heterogeneous spending are unlikely to be transported, overriding familial group assumptions.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 25 with non-zero Spa spending are unlikely to be transported, addressing mid-life expenditure reversals regardless of deck.
11. Mars passengers under age 30 in CryoSleep on E or G decks with all zero spending are likely to be transported if part of assumed family units, enhancing demographic group support patterns.
12. Passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-35 with high VRDeck spending (>500) are unlikely to be transported, highlighting risks in immersive activity engagement.
13. Earth passengers on G deck cabins aged 20-40 not in CryoSleep with non-zero RoomService and ShoppingMall are unlikely to be transported, correcting underestimated solo traveler tendencies.
14. Passengers with NaN HomePlanet not in CryoSleep and non-zero RoomService are unlikely to be transported, mitigating biases from unknown origins.
15. Europa passengers from C or A decks not in CryoSleep aged 25-45 with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending over 1000 are unlikely to be transported, refining high-luxury spending outliers.
