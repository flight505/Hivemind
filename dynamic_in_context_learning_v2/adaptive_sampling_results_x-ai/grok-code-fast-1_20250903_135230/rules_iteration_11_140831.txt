PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 11
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Children (age under 18) from Earth not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are likely to be transported, prioritizing family preservation patterns.
2. VIP passengers from Europa, regardless of CryoSleep status and spending levels, are highly likely to be transported, emphasizing elite service influences.
3. Young adults (age 18-35) from Earth not in CryoSleep with moderate FoodCourt or VRDeck spending (100-2000 total) or significant ShoppingMall spending (over 500) are likely to be transported, focusing on leisure and exploration behaviors.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep traveling to 55 Cancri e with zero spending across amenities are unlikely to be transported if age is 30 or above, considering destination-specific health risks.
5. Europa passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, reflecting planetary survival trends.
6. Young children (age under 10) from Earth in CryoSleep with zero spending across amenities are unlikely to be transported, highlighting vulnerability in stasis for terrestrial origins.
7. Adults from Earth not in CryoSleep with combined VRDeck and Spa spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported if age is under 35, adapting to amenity utilization patterns.
8. Europa children not in CryoSleep with spending limited to high FoodCourt or ShoppingMall (over 3000 total) are likely to be transported, adjusting for luxury consumption outliers.
9. Passengers traveling to non-standard destinations (like PSO J318.5-22) with moderate combined spending (500-2000 across amenities) are likely to be transported if from Earth and not in CryoSleep, accounting for adventure-seeking traits.
