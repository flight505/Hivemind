PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 31
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Young passengers aged under 20 from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing familial dependency patterns over low activity assumptions for children.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 40 from B or C decks with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if from GroupIds larger than 01, countering demographic transport biases for dependent minors.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 50 or older on E decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger groups, mitigating overconfidence in elderly CryoSleep trends without familial context.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged under 15 on E or G decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if solo travelers, overriding family unit biases for independent juvenile patterns.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 14-50 on E, F, or G decks with low to moderate spending (under 2000 total) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, reinforcing socioeconomic stability signals in middle demographics.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-35 on D, F, or E decks with high RoomService spending (over 1000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending is non-zero, emphasizing impulsive leisure compensations in young adults.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 30-40 on C or D decks with high FoodCourt spending (over 1000) and moderate VRDeck (under 1000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing outlier high-expenditure retention behaviors.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-40 on D decks with high combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending (over 3500) destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, refining luxury indulgence reversals in mid-age groups.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged around 30 on F decks with high RoomService spending (over 1000) and minimal other spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting service utilization patterns for stressed travelers.
10. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 30-35 on F decks with high RoomService (over 700) and ShoppingMall (over 1000) spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if Spa and VRDeck are minimal, highlighting compensatory shopping in adulthood.
