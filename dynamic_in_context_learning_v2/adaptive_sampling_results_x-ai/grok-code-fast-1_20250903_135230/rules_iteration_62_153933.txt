PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 62
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 with all zero spending on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, prioritizing young demographic transport priorities in low-activity economies.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on F or G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e aged 25-30 are unlikely to be transported, countering baseline CryoSleep assumptions for mid-adult silent groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 10 with all zero spending from any deck to any destination are likely to be transported, emphasizing Europa's familial preservation patterns regardless of activity.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-50 from D deck cabins with moderate RoomService spending (over 350) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, adjusting for Mars demographic spending efficiencies.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with total spending under 100 on F or G decks destined for PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, refining young adult budget transport tendencies.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on A or B decks with total FoodCourt and Spa spending over 5000 destined for 55 Cancri e aged over 35 are likely to be transported, addressing wealthy Europa override patterns.
7. Passengers with VIP status not in CryoSleep from any HomePlanet on D deck cabins with zero RoomService and moderate FoodCourt spending (500-2000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, integrating VIP convenience priorities.
8. Passengers with missing HomePlanet in CryoSleep on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, mitigating errors in mixed homeland CryoSleep baselines.
