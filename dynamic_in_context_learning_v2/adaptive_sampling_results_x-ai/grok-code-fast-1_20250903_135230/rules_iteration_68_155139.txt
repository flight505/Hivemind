PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 68
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 21-39 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining age thresholds for demographic transport risks in under-40 CryoSleep groups.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on G deck cabins with total spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing moderate spending patterns that override inactivity biases in middle-aged groups.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 destined for PSO J318.5-22 or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing youth-focused food expenditure trends despite non-Cryo status.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers with unknown cabin locations and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e, particularly aged 35-45, are likely to be transported if no high-transaction amenities are involved, correcting for cabin-missing variables in zero-activity cases.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-25 on F deck cabins with RoomService exceeding 2000 but other amenities under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating isolated high-service outliers for younger demographics.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing concentrated food spending in young adult patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-5 from any deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo baselines for infant and toddler high-priority groups.
8. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 50-70 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting senior leisure-focused expenditure reversals.
9. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-15 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending under 2000 and VRDeck under 10 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining adolescent activity thresholds.
10. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers with unknown age on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending zero-expenditure patterns for Marseille non-Cryo youth-equivalent groups.
