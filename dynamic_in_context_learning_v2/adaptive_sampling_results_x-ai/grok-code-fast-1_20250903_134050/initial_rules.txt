PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers who are in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported, regardless of other factors.
2. Passengers from Europa are more likely to be transported than those from Earth or Mars.
3. Passengers from Earth who are not in CryoSleep and have no spending on amenities are less likely to be transported.
4. Passengers from Mars are moderately likely to be transported if they are in CryoSleep, but less so otherwise.
5. Younger passengers (ages 0-25) are more likely to be transported if in CryoSleep.
6. Older passengers (ages over 50) are less likely to be transported if not in CryoSleep and have spending on amenities.
7. Passengers with high spending (above 1000 total on any amenity) who are not in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported.
8. Passengers with no spending across all amenities are highly likely to be transported if in CryoSleep.
9. VIP passengers are less likely to be transported if they have non-zero spending on amenities.
10. Passengers in cabins starting with A, B, or C are more likely to be transported.
11. Passengers in cabins starting with G, E, or F are less likely to be transported, especially if from Earth and not in CryoSleep.
12. Passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported if from Europa and in CryoSleep.
13. Passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e are variably likely to be transported, with higher chances for CryoSleep passengers from Europa.
14. Passengers with family group indicators (e.g., shared prefixes in IDs) tend to have similar transport outcomes within the group.
15. Moderate spending on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall is associated with higher transport likelihood if the passenger is from Mars or Europa.
16. Passengers with any spending on Spa or VRDeck who are not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported, particularly from Earth.
17. Passengers with missing age data are more likely to be transported if in CryoSleep and from non-Earth planets.
18. Cabin locations with Port (P) or Starboard (S) have similar transport likelihoods, but combined with CryoSleep status, CryoSleep boosts odds.
