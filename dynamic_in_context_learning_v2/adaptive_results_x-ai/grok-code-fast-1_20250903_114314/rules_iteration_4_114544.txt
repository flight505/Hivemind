PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if their spending across all amenities is zero, particularly if the cabin deck is E or G, or if the destination is 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep have a higher likelihood of transport if their total spending is between 500 and 1500, especially when heading to TRAPPIST-1e and not VIP.
3. Passengers from Europa with aggregate spending in Spa, FoodCourt, VRDeck, RoomService, and ShoppingMall exceeding 5000 are still likely to be transported if not in CryoSleep and not VIP, despite high luxury spending.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with total spending above 500 are more likely to be transported, regardless of destination or cabin details.
5. Passengers from Earth aged under 10 in CryoSleep with zero spending are less likely to be transported if the cabin deck is E, even if part of a family group.
6. Family or group members from Earth or Mars sharing the same cabin number with mixed CryoSleep statuses are more likely to be transported if not in CryoSleep and spending is moderate (total between 0 and 2000), while those in CryoSleep remain unpredictable.
7. Non-Earth passengers (Europa or Mars) in CryoSleep with zero spending are likely to be transported unless cabin deck is E and destination is 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22.
8. Passengers from any home planet not in CryoSleep aged between 20 and 45 are more likely to be transported if spending is moderate and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, overriding negative spending correlations.
9. High luxury spending (Spa, VRDeck, FoodCourt aggregate >2000) correlates negatively with transport for VIP passengers or those from Earth in CryoSleep, but less so for non-VIP Europa passengers without CryoSleep.
10. Passengers in cabins starting with B or C from Europa are likely to be transported with high spending if not in CryoSleep, especially to 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e.
