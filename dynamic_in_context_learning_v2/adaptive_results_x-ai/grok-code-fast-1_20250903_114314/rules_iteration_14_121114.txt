PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if they have high Spa or VRDeck spending exceeding 600, even if FoodCourt spending is above 1000 and in luxury cabins like A/ or B/, particularly if RoomService is above 20 or age is over 30.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep under 18 are more likely to be transported, regardless of RoomService or Spa spending levels, when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, overriding zero-spending patterns.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000, even if RoomService is above zero and total Spa or VRDeck spending is below 150, especially in F/ cabins shared with family.
4. Passengers to PSO J318.5-22 from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is above 400 and Spa spending is below 500, with zero VRDeck spending, regardless of port-side cabin location.
5. Family groups from Earth in CryoSleep with zero spending are less likely to be transported if they include members aged 30 or older, favoring non-transport unless all are under 18 in shared cabins like E/.
6. Passengers over 50 from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if total spending across RoomService, Spa, and VRDeck exceeds 100, particularly in A/ cabins along with VIP status.
7. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 700 and combined Spa or VRDeck spending is below 600, including cases where RoomService contributes to total spending patterns.
8. Young children under 13 from Mars not in CryoSleep in shared cabins are more likely to be transported if zero spending applies, even if family members in the same group have varying spending habits.
9. Overall, port-side cabins from any home planet with CryoSleep adults over 30 and zero spending reduce transport likelihood unless part of mixed-age groups where under-18 members dominate.
