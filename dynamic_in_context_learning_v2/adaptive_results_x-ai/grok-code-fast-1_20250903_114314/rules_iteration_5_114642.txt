PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate spending (total luxury amenities between 100 and 1000) have an increased likelihood of transport, especially if heading to TRAPPIST-1e and lacking VIP status.
2. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth on F or G decks, port side, with any spending in FoodCourt or Spa, regardless of amount, are more likely transported if age is under 40 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e.
3. Passengers from Europa or Mars not in CryoSleep, with spending in ShoppingMall or VRDeck but minimal RoomService, have higher transport chances even with modest total amenity spending under 2000.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on E decks, port or starboard, sharing cabins (indicated by similar deck/num/side), have a reduced transport likelihood when in family groups with mixed ages or destinations.
5. Young passengers (under 30) from Earth not in CryoSleep, destined for 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22, are likely transported even with limited spending in amenities like Spa or VRDeck.
6. Passengers from Mars with zero spending but not in CryoSleep are unpredictably transported unless all cabin-sharing family members are in CryoSleep and headed to TRAPPIST-1e.
7. VIP status on Europa passengers reduces transport likelihood if not in CryoSleep, particularly with FoodCourt or Spa spending over 500, outweighing age or destination factors.
8. Older passengers (over 40) from non-Earth homeplanets in CryoSleep have high transport chances only if all amenities are zero; moderate spending in any amenity decreases this likelihood significantly.
9. Earth passengers on starboard side, CryoSleep, with zero spending are less likely transported if the cabin deck is E and destination is not TRAPPIST-1e.
10. Non-VIP passengers from Earth over 18 in CryoSleep are more likely transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, but transcribed if the cabin is port side on G decks and spending is exactly zero.
