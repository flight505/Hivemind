PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 12
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with extremely high Spa spending above 2000 (regardless of FoodCourt or VRDeck amounts and destination) are less likely to be transported, overriding standard high-spending transport boosts for this demographic.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with moderate FoodCourt spending between 400 and 700 and total amenity spending above 200 but below 600 are more likely to be transported, even if Spa or VRDeck is moderate, adjusting for standard low-transport age biases.
3. Young passengers from Earth under 18 not in CryoSleep with any non-zero total spending are more likely to be transported, particularly in port-side cabins, countering typical zero-spending non-transport patterns for non-Cryo states.
4. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep with high ShoppingMall spending above 1000 (combined with zero RoomService or low VRDeck) are more likely to be transported, especially if aged under 50, generalizing from family group spending allocations.
5. Passengers from any non-Earth planet not in CryoSleep headed to PSO J318.5-22 with FoodCourt spending between 400 and 800 (even if Spa exceeds 300) are more likely transported, refining destination-specific spending thresholds for off-Earth origins.
6. Passengers over 50 not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending above 200 are less likely transported if from Earth or Mars, but more likely if from Europa with FoodCourt above 1000, balancing age and home planet interactions.
7. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with VIP status and any non-zero spending across amenities have reduced transport likelihood if aged over 40, paralleling stricter CryoSleep checks for wealthy older demographics.
8. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep aged 30-50 without VIP status are less likely transported if located in starboard cabins and destined for non-TRAPPIST destinations, addressing CryoSleep variability across ships sections.
9. Family groups sharing the same cabin from Mars with at least one adult over 30 and one child under 18 (not in CryoSleep) have increased transport likelihood if total group ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000, capturing group spending dynamics.
10. Overall, non-VIP passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with high combined Spa and VRDeck spending above 3000 are less likely transported, even with elevated FoodCourt, to correct over-prediction in luxury amenity misuse patterns.
