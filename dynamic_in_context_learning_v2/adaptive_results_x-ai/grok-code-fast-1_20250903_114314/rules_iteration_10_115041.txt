PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if FoodCourt or Spa spending exceeds 1000, despite high total amenities spending, particularly for those over 30 years old and destined to standard destinations like TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if total spending across all amenities exceeds 300 but remains below 1000, even with elevated Spa or VRDeck costs up to 600, regardless of age below 50.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 500 or combined ShoppingMall and VRDeck spending exceeds 800, even with non-zero RoomService up to 150, especially for ages between 15 and 50.
4. Young Earth passengers under 18 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if in family groups sharing the same cabin section, even with zero spending across amenities, overriding low-transport patterns for non-group members.
5. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep heading to PSO J318.5-22 are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 400 and Spa spending is below 400, regardless of other amenity spends.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with VIP status and any non-zero amenity spending are less likely to be transported, strengthening the inverse relationship between spending and transport for this demographic.
7. Port-side cabin passengers from any home planet but matching VIP status False are more likely transported if not in CryoSleep and total spending is below 100, especially for Earth passengers under 25 in group cabins.
