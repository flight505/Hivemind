PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 1000 are less likely to be transported if Spa spending exceeds 1000 or RoomService exceeds 20, even without high VIP status, particularly for ages above 30.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 10 to 50 with total Spa and VRDeck spending below 600 and FoodCourt spending above 200 are more likely to be transported, overriding typical non-transport patterns for standard destinations like TRAPPIST-1e.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending exceeds 1000 and total Spa and RoomService spending is low or zero, regardless of age between 20 and 50 or younger.
4. Passengers from non-Earth planets not in CryoSleep destined to PSO J318.5-22 are less likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is below 400 despite low total spending, correcting overestimations in transport likelihood.
5. Port-side cabin passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with only VRDeck spending below 200 and zero FoodCourt are more likely transported if under 25 years old, aligning with group family patterns.
6. Starboard-side cabin passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep under 18 with zero total spending are more likely transported if part of a larger group family sharing the same cabin deck, countering low-activity misjudgments.
7. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with any amenity spending exceeding zero are less likely transported if VIP status is False or age is above 40, reducing dependency on CryoSleep for privileged cabins like A or B.
8. Passengers above 50 not in CryoSleep from Europa with high FoodCourt and Spa spending combined exceeding 5000 are less likely transported, even to destinations like 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep above 40 are more likely transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000 and VRDeck spending is low or zero, irrespective of family group context.
