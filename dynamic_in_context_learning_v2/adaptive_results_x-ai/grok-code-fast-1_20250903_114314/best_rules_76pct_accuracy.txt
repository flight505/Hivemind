IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep have a reduced likelihood of being transported if they are over 30 years old and have zero spending across all luxury amenities, even if destined to standard destinations like TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if their FoodCourt spending exceeds 700 and total Spa or VRDeck spending is below 300, regardless of age or home planet context.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if their total ShoppingMall and VRDeck spending exceeds 1000 and RoomService is zero, especially if age is between 20 and 50.
4. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is above 1000, even with elevated Spa spending up to 600, particularly for those not in VIP status.
5. Family or group passengers sharing the same cabin deck and side from Earth have unpredictable transport if containing members over 30 in CryoSleep with zero spending, favoring non-transport for such groups unless all members are under 18 in CryoSleep.
6. Passengers above 50 years old not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if RoomService spending is above 100, particularly from Earth or Mars.
7. Young passengers from Earth under 18 not in CryoSleep but in port-side cabins with zero spending are more likely to be transported if part of a group, despite standard low-transport patterns.
8. Passengers to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep are more likely transported if from non-Earth planets and have FoodCourt spending above 400, overriding high-spending penalties in Spa or VRDeck.
9. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with VIP status have reduced transport likelihood if any amenity spending exceeds zero, paralleling non-VIP patterns but with stronger CryoSleep dependency.
10. Overall, port-side cabin passengers from any home planet are more likely transported if not in CryoSleep but have low total spending below 200, especially for Earth passengers خواه Peking.
