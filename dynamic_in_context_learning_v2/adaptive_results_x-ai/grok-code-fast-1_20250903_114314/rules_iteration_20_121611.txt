PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 500 and total spending across other amenities (RoomService, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) is below 300, overriding moderate RoomService or Spa influences up to 600.
2. Young passengers from Earth under 10 who are in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if located in E or G deck cabins, particularly port or starboard sides, countering general CryoSleep trends.
3. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if over 25 years old and spending is zero across all amenities, regardless of cabin deck or side for decks like E or G.
4. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000, even if VRDeck spending is low or zero, combined with moderate Spa spending above 500.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 15-40 are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is between 700 and 1600 and Spa spending is between 0 and 600, emphasizing youth and moderate amenity balances over isolated high spending.
6. Port-side cabin passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if all amenity spending matches exactly Spa exceeding 500 with low FoodCourt and high ShoppingMall, countering assumptions for other Europa rules.
7. Passengers to TRAPPIST-1e from Earth not in CryoSleep aged over 50 are less likely to be transported if RoomService exceeds 700 and ShoppingMall is below 50, particularly in low-deck cabins like G or F.
8. Family group members (shared PassengerId root) from Earth in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported en masse if the group includes children under 5 and is stationed in E deck cabins with zero spending, overriding typical family transport benefits.
9. Passengers from non-European planets not in CryoSleep under 30 are more likely to be transported if total spending is between 1000 and 2000, focusing on combined spending across multiple amenities rather than single excess spikes.
10. Overall, CryoSleep passengers from Earth are less likely to be transported if over 50 and in G deck cabins, shifting predictions away from universal CryoSleep transport assumptions for older demographics.
