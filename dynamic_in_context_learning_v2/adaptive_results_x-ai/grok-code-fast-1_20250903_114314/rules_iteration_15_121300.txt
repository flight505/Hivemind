PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with high FoodCourt spending (above 1000) are less likely to be transported if Spa spending exceeds 300 or total spending across amenities surpasses 5000, particularly for ages above 30, overriding positive influences from destination or VIP status.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if age is under 30 and combined Spa plus VRDeck spending is above 500, even with moderate RoomService, shifting from lower to higher likelihood patterns.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000 and VRDeck spending exceeds 100, regardless of RoomService levels, especially for ages between 18 and 50.
4. Passengers from any home planet under 18 not in CryoSleep with zero total spending are more likely to be transported if in port-side cabins (e.g., decks A, B, or C), especially in group settings with shared cabin sections.
5. Passengers from Earth or Mars over 30 not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if RoomService spending exceeds 200, with reduced likelihood further if total amenity spending is below 1000, enhancing demographic filters.
6. Passengers destined to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep from Earth are more likely transported if FoodCourt spending is between 400 and 600 and total spending is below average, refining destination-based predictions.
7. Europa passengers in VIP status not in CryoSleep with any amenity spending above zero have reduced transport likelihood, particularly if age exceeds 40 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e.
8. Family or group passengers in shared cabins (e.g., same deck and side) with members over 30 and zero spending are less likely transported unless the group includes children under 18 in CryoSleep, refining group dynamics.
9. Passengers above 50 years old from Mars or Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely transported if total ShoppingMall plus VRDeck spending exceeds 1000, counteracting age-related penalties.
10. Overall, non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa with VIP status have lower transport odds if combined Spa and VRDeck spending exceeds 100, even with high FoodCourt, generalizing outlier spending behavior.
11. Port-side cabin passengers from Earth under 40 not in CryoSleep are less likely transported if zero spending, unless age is under 18, aligning with effective patterns for low-engagement groups.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep below age 18 with zero spending in shared cabins are optimized to higher transport likelihood if part of multi-member groups, capturing child group advantages.
