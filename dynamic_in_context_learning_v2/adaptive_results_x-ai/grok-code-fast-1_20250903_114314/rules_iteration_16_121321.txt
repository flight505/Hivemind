PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep passengers with zero spending across all amenities are less likely to be transported if over 30 years old, regardless of home planet or destination.
2. Passengers not in CryoSleep with total Spa and VRDeck spending exceeding 500 are less likely to be transported if total expenses surpass 1500, particularly from Europa or Earth.
3. Earth or Mars passengers under 18 not in CryoSleep with any amenity spending above zero and zero RoomService are more likely to be transported, overriding standard low-spend patterns for adults.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with VIP status are less likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 1000 or total Spa exceeds 500, even if destined to standard planets.
5. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000 and total Spa or VRDeck is zero, especially between ages 20 and 50.
6. Non-CryoSleep passengers destining to PSO J318.5-22 are more likely transported if FoodCourt exceeds 400 and they are from non-Earth planets, countering high aggregate amenity spend penalties.
7. Adults over 50 not in CryoSleep with RoomService above 100 are less likely transported than predicted by current spending rules alone, particularly for Earth or Mars origins.
8. Port-side cabin passengers not in CryoSleep with low total spending below 50 are less likely to be transported if over 20, despite previous port-side biases for Earth passengers.
9. Family groups in shared cabins with mixed CryoSleep statuses are less predictable, with non-transport favored for groups including adults over 30 in CryoSleep with zero spending.
10. Passengers under 10 not in CryoSleep with zero spending are more likely transported if part of a larger shared cabin group, regardless of home planet.
