PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Group-majority rule: For passengers sharing a group (same identifier before the underscore), predict the groupâ€™s majority Transported; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.

2. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, RoomService >= 800 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100 and ShoppingMall <= 300 -> Transported = False.

3. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, ShoppingMall >= 500 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100 -> Transported = True.

4. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, FoodCourt >= 700 and RoomService <= 200 and Spa <= 500 and VRDeck <= 600 -> Transported = True.

5. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, TotalSpend = 0 and Age <= 12 -> Transported = True.

6. Destination = 55 Cancri e, CryoSleep = False, (ShoppingMall >= 600 and RoomService <= 50 and Spa <= 50 and VRDeck <= 50) OR (FoodCourt >= 3000 and RoomService = 0 and VRDeck <= 200 and Spa <= 300) -> Transported = True.

7. Destination = 55 Cancri e, CryoSleep = False -> Transported = False.

8. Destination is missing, CryoSleep = False, (FoodCourt >= 1200 and RoomService <= 200) -> Transported = True.

9. Destination is missing, HomePlanet = Europa, CryoSleep = False, (VRDeck >= 500 OR FoodCourt >= 3000) -> Transported = True.

10. Destination is missing, CryoSleep = False, TotalSpend > 0 -> Transported = False.

11. CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0 and HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e -> Transported = False.

12. Destination = PSO J318.5-22, CryoSleep = True, HomePlanet = Earth, Age >= 10 -> Transported = False.

13. Destination = PSO J318.5-22, CryoSleep = True, HomePlanet = Earth, Cabin side = P -> Transported = False.

14. CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

15. CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend <= 10 -> Transported = True.

16. Cabin deck in {A,B,C,D,E} and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

17. CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 1000 and NOT (HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e) -> Transported = False.

18. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend >= 2000 and NOT (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and ShoppingMall >= 500 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100) -> Transported = False.

19. HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = False and Destination != TRAPPIST-1e and TotalSpend > 0 -> Transported = False.

20. VIP = True and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e -> Transported = True.

21. VIP = True and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 and Destination != TRAPPIST-1e -> Transported = False.

22. HomePlanet = Europa and (CryoSleep = True OR TotalSpend <= 50) -> Transported = True.

23. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (CryoSleep = True OR TotalSpend <= 50) -> Transported = True.

24. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16 -> Transported = False.

25. HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G} and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16 -> Transported = False.

26. HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

27. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 -> Transported = False.

28. Age >= 55 and CryoSleep = False and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

29. Age >= 55 and CryoSleep = False -> Transported = False.

30. CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

31. Cabin is missing and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

32. Default: If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e OR HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise Transported = False.
