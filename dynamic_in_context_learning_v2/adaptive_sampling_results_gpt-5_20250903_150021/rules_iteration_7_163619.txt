PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 7
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Group-majority rule: For passengers sharing a group (same identifier before the underscore), predict the groupâ€™s majority Transported; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.

2. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, RoomService >= 800 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100 and ShoppingMall <= 300 -> Transported = False.

3. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, CryoSleep = False, ShoppingMall >= 500 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100 and RoomService <= 500 -> Transported = True.
