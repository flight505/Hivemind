PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. For passengers sharing a group (same group identifier before the underscore in PassengerId), predict each passenger to match the majority Transported label within their group; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.
2. If VIP is True and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = True.
3. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend = 0 and HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck = G and (Age is missing or Age >= 18), predict Transported = False.
4. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend = 0 and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and Cabin deck = E and Age >= 25, predict Transported = False.
5. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100 and ShoppingMall >= 500, predict Transported = True.
6. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep is False and Age <= 35 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100, predict Transported = True.
7. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep is False and RoomService >= 1000 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100, predict Transported = True.
8. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep is False and ShoppingMall >= 500 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100, predict Transported = True.
9. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep is False and (Spa + VRDeck) = 0 and (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 300, predict Transported = True.
10. If HomePlanet is missing and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = False.
11. If CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16, predict Transported = False.
12. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.
13. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend <= 10, predict Transported = True.
14. If HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = True.
15. If HomePlanet = Europa and (CryoSleep is True or TotalSpend <= 50), predict Transported = True.
16. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (CryoSleep is True or TotalSpend <= 50), predict Transported = True.
17. If CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend >= 2000, predict Transported = False.
18. If CryoSleep is False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 1000 and NOT (HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e), predict Transported = False.
19. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = False.
20. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
21. If HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G} and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = False.
22. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
23. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
24. If VIP is True and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0 and Destination != TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = False.
25. If Age <= 12 and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
26. If Age <= 5 and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0 and HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G}, predict Transported = False.
27. If Age >= 55 and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = False.
28. If Cabin deck in {A,B,C,D,E} and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
29. If Cabin side = P and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
30. If Cabin side = S and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
31. If CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.
32. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
33. If Cabin is missing and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
34. If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e or HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise predict Transported = False.
