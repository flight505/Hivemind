PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Group-majority rule: For passengers sharing a group (same identifier before the underscore), predict the groupâ€™s majority Transported; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.

2. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True and HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin side = S -> Transported = False.

3. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and HomePlanet = Earth and CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and Cabin side = P -> Transported = False.

4. CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 18 -> Transported = False.

5. CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

6. CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend <= 10 -> Transported = True.

7. Cabin deck in {A,B,C,D,E} and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

8. CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

9. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and Age <= 12 and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

10. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and ShoppingMall >= 500 and RoomService <= 200 and Spa <= 50 and VRDeck <= 50 -> Transported = True.

11. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and FoodCourt >= 500 and RoomService <= 50 and ShoppingMall <= 100 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100 -> Transported = True.

12. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age <= 12 and Cabin deck = G -> Transported = False.

13. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age <= 12 -> Transported = True.

14. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and ShoppingMall >= 500 and RoomService <= 200 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100 -> Transported = True.

15. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and FoodCourt >= 700 and RoomService <= 200 and Spa <= 200 and VRDeck <= 100 -> Transported = True.

16. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and HomePlanet = Europa and CryoSleep = False and VRDeck <= 100 and TotalSpend >= 1000 -> Transported = True.

17. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and Cabin deck != G and VRDeck >= 1200 and RoomService <= 200 and Spa <= 200 and ShoppingMall <= 200 -> Transported = True.

18. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and Cabin deck != G and 800 <= VRDeck < 1200 and RoomService <= 200 and Spa <= 200 and ShoppingMall <= 200 -> Transported = True.

19. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and Cabin deck != G and TotalSpend >= 2000 and VRDeck <= 900 and Spa <= 300 -> Transported = True.

20. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and Age >= 55 and VRDeck = 0 and TotalSpend <= 1500 -> Transported = True.

21. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False -> Transported = False.

22. CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 1000 and NOT (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and Cabin deck != G) -> Transported = False.

23. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend >= 2000 and NOT (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and Cabin deck != G) -> Transported = False.

24. HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = False and Destination != TRAPPIST-1e and TotalSpend > 0 -> Transported = False.

25. VIP = True and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e -> Transported = True.

26. VIP = True and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 and Destination != TRAPPIST-1e -> Transported = False.

27. HomePlanet = Europa and (CryoSleep = True OR TotalSpend <= 50) -> Transported = True.

28. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (CryoSleep = True OR TotalSpend <= 50) -> Transported = True.

29. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16 -> Transported = False.

30. HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G} and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16 -> Transported = False.

31. HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

32. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 -> Transported = False.

33. Age >= 55 and CryoSleep = False and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and TotalSpend = 0 -> Transported = True.

34. Age >= 55 and CryoSleep = False -> Transported = False.

35. Cabin is missing and CryoSleep = True -> Transported = True.

36. Default: If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e OR HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise Transported = False.
