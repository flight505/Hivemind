PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_spend (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall+Spa+VRDeck) <= 10 THEN predict Transported = True]
2. [If CryoSleep is missing AND total_spend = 0 THEN predict Transported = True]
3. [If VIP = True AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
4. [If total_spend >= 2500 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
5. [If count_of_nonzero_spend_categories >= 4 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
6. [If Age < 12 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
7. [If HomePlanet = Mars AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
8. [If HomePlanet = Europa AND CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True]
9. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
10. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True]
11. [If Cabin deck ∈ {B, C, D, E} AND CryoSleep != True AND total_spend <= 100 THEN predict Transported = True]
12. [If Cabin deck ∈ {F, G, T} AND Destination != TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
13. [If any immediate family/group member (same group identifier before underscore or same cabin number) is in CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True for the whole group]
14. [If group_total_spend >= 4000 AND no one in the group is in CryoSleep THEN predict Transported = False for the group]
15. [If CryoSleep is missing AND total_spend > 0 THEN predict Transported = False]
16. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep != True AND total_spend > 0 THEN predict Transported = False]
17. [If ShoppingMall > 700 OR VRDeck > 1000 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
18. [Otherwise (no rule matched) THEN predict Transported = False]
