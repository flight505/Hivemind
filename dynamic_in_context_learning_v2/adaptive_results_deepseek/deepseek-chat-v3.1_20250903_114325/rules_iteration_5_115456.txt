PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with total expenditure less than 50 are highly likely transported, except on Earth for ages under 2 or over 60 where probability decreases, particularly to TRAPPIST-1e.
2. Earth passengers with total expenditure less than 500 have increased transport likelihood if age under 25 or destination is 55 Cancri e; expenditure between 500 and 1500 shows variable likelihood based on age and destination.
3. Non-Earth passengers (Europa or Mars) with expenditure up to 2500 may still be transported if age is under 20 or destination is favorable, overriding high expenditure reductions.
4. Children under age 5 have very high transport probability almost regardless of expenditure or CryoSleep status, except on Earth with expenditure over 1000.
5. Group travel strongly correlates transport; individuals in groups where majority are transported are more likely transported, especially with shared last names or cabin decks.
6. Destination TRAPPIST-1e has increased transport probability for passengers with expenditure less than 1000 or from Mars/Europa, contrary to lower base likelihood.
7. CryoSleep with zero expenditure generally ensures transport, but on Earth, exceptions apply for infants or elderly to certain destinations.
8. Expenditure greater than 1500 on Earth reduces transport likelihood, but for young ages (under 18) or non-Earth origins, this reduction is less severe.
9. Cabin decks B or C indicate higher transport rates for non-Earth passengers, while side (port/starboard) effects are minimal.
10. VIP status combined with high expenditure on Earth slightly reduces transport probability, but alone has negligible impact.
11. Zero expenditure without CryoSleep on Earth may not ensure transport, especially to TRAPPIST-1e, unless age is very young or group context.
12. Passengers from Mars or Europa with moderate expenditure (500-2000) and age under 30 have high transport likelihood to all destinations.
13. Infants (age 0-1) are always transported if expenditure is low or zero, regardless of other factors, except on Earth with high expenditure or specific destinations.
14. Age between 18 and 30 on Earth with expenditure less than 800 increases transport probability, especially to PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e.
15. Group majority transport status overrides individual expenditure patterns for passengers sharing cabins or last names.
