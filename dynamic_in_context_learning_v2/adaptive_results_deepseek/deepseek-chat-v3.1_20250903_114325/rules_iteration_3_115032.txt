PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported due to zero expenditure and transit status, with exceptions for very young or old ages on Earth where transport probability may decrease.
2. Total expenditure on amenities: passengers with total expenditure less than 100 are more likely transported; expenditure between 100 and 1000 has variable likelihood influenced by age and home planet; expenditure greater than 1000 generally reduces transport likelihood, except for non-Earth origins or group travel contexts.
3. Passengers from Europa or Mars have higher base transport probability than Earth, but Earth passengers can be transported with low expenditure, young age, or specific destinations.
4. Younger passengers (under 18 years old) have increased transport likelihood, which is strong even with moderate expenditure, and is enhanced by CryoSleep or group travel.
5. Group travel (shared last names or cabins) strongly correlates transport outcomes; individuals in groups with majority transported are more likely transported, and vice versa.
6. Destination significantly influences transport: 55 Cancri e has higher likelihood, TRAPPIST-1e has lower likelihood, and PSO J318.5-22 has variable rates based on other factors.
7. VIP status has minimal effect alone but reduces transport probability when combined with high expenditure, especially on Earth.
8. Cabin location on specific decks (e.g., lower decks like B or C) may indicate higher transport rates for non-Earth passengers, while starboard or port sides show minor variations.
9. Age demographics: infants (age 0-1) and very young children (age 2-5) have high transport likelihood regardless of expenditure if not in CryoSleep, but CryoSleep may not always ensure transport for Earth-based infants.
10. Expenditure patterns: zero expenditure alone is not sufficient for transport on Earth without CryoSleep or young age; moderate expenditure on Mars or Europa does not preclude transport.
