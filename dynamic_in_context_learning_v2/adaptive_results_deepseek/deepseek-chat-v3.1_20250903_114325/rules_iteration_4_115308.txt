PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa or Mars with CryoSleep and zero expenditure are always transported, regardless of age or destination.
2. Earth passengers with age under 35 and total expenditure less than 2000 are likely transported, with higher probability for ages under 18 and destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e.
3. Group travel (same cabin) strongly indicates correlated transport; if over 50% of group members are transported, predict transport for individuals, and vice versa.
4. CryoSleep ensures transport for non-Earth passengers and for Earth passengers with age between 2 and 60, unless destination is TRAPPIST-1e or group majority not transported.
5. Non-Earth passengers with high expenditure (up to 5000) are still likely transported, with minimal reduction in probability.
6. Destination TRAPPIST-1e significantly reduces transport likelihood for Earth passengers with age over 35 or expenditure over 1000.
7. Age under 5 greatly increases transport likelihood for all passengers, even with moderate expenditure.
8. VIP status slightly reduces transport probability for Earth passengers when combined with high expenditure (over 1500).
