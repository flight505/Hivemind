PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported, but this effect is significantly weaker for passengers from Earth.
2. Passengers with zero total expenditure are very likely to be transported, but for Earth passengers, expenditure must be very low (e.g., less than 50) to strongly indicate transport.
3. Passengers from Europa or Mars have a high base probability of being transported, and moderate expenditure (up to 1500) does not strongly reduce this likelihood, especially when combined with young age or CryoSleep.
4. Young passengers (under 10 years old) are more likely to be transported, with the effect strongest for non-Earth passengers or those with no expenditure.
5. For group travel, if most family members (shared last name and cabin) are transported, individuals are likely transported, but this is secondary to other factors.
6. Cabin location on certain decks (e.g., deck E) may indicate lower transport probability, particularly for Earth passengers.
7. Destination to TRAPPIST-1e may increase transport probability, while destinations like 55 Cancri e may have lower rates, but this is a minor factor compared to home planet, expenditure, and age.
8. VIP status with high expenditure may indicate lower transport probability, but for non-Earth passengers, this effect is reduced.
