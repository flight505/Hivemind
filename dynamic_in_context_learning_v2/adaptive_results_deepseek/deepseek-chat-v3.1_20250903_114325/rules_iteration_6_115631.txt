PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported, but for Earth origins, transport probability decreases significantly if age is less than 2 years or greater than 60 years.
2. Total expenditure greater than 1000 reduces transport likelihood for Earth passengers, but this reduction is overcome if age is under 18 years; for non-Earth passengers, high expenditure does not reduce likelihood.
3. Young passengers under 18 years old have strongly increased transport likelihood that overrides moderate to high expenditure on Earth.
4. Group travel outcomes are highly correlated; predict transported if the majority of the group is transported, else predict not transported.
5. Destination TRAPPIST-1e has lower base transport likelihood, but this is mitigated by CryoSleep status or age under 18.
6. Infants (age 0-1) on Earth have high transport likelihood if not in CryoSleep, but likelihood is reduced if in CryoSleep.
7. For Earth passengers, expenditure between 1000 and 2000 may not reduce transport likelihood if age is under 30 years.
8. Non-Earth passengers with high expenditure maintain or have increased transport likelihood compared to Earth passengers with similar expenditure.
9. Cabin location on lower decks (e.g., B, C) may indicate higher transport rates for non-Earth passengers, but this is secondary to other factors like expenditure and age.
10. VIP status reduces transport probability when combined with high expenditure on Earth, but has minimal effect alone or on non-Earth origins.
