PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 7
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers with moderate total expenditure (100-2000) should have increased transport likelihood when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, except when VIP or over age 40 with high spa expenditures.
2. Infants (age 0-1) from Earth in CryoSleep should have reduced transport probability compared to other age groups, unless part of a group with transported members.
3. Passengers from Europa or Mars with zero expenditure and in CryoSleep always transported, regardless of destination or other factors.
4. Group travel consistency: when majority of group members are transported, all members in CryoSleep with zero expenditure should be transported, overriding individual age or destination factors.
5. TRAPPIST-1e destination passengers with total expenditure between 500-1500 from any planet have elevated transport probability, contrary to previous lower likelihood assumption.
6. Earth passengers aged 15-25 with expenditure under 500 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates than previously estimated.
7. VIP status combined with high expenditure (>2000) on Earth always prevents transport, regardless of other factors.
8. Cabin deck B and F passengers from non-Earth origins with any expenditure level have higher transport rates than previously estimated.
9. Mars passengers with moderate expenditure (200-800) showing balanced spending across amenities (not concentrated in one category) have increased transport likelihood.
10. Passengers with missing shopping mall data but otherwise zero expenditure should be treated as zero expenditure cases for transport decisions.
11. Very young children (age 2-5) from Earth with any expenditure under 300 should have elevated transport probability when not in CryoSleep.
12. Group members sharing cabins should have transport outcomes consistent with the group majority when expenditure patterns are similar (<200 difference in total spending).
