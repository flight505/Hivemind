IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep is True AND the passenger's total spend (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) is zero or missing AND (HomePlanet is Europa OR VIP is True OR Age < 18 OR cabin deck letter is 'C' or 'D'), predict Transported = True.]

2. [If CryoSleep is True AND the passenger's total spend is zero or missing AND none of the strong indicators in rule 1 apply (not Europa, not VIP, Age â‰¥ 18, cabin deck not C/D), predict Transported = False.]

3. [If CryoSleep is True AND total spend > 0, predict Transported = False unless the spending profile is dominated (>50% of total) by ShoppingMall AND (Age < 30 OR HomePlanet is Europa), in which case predict Transported = True.]

4. [If CryoSleep is False AND total spend >= 2000 (sum of services is very high), predict Transported = False.]

5. [If CryoSleep is False AND total spend > 100 AND a single category (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) accounts for >50% of the passenger's spend: if the dominant category is Spa, VRDeck, FoodCourt or RoomService, predict Transported = False; if the dominant category is ShoppingMall, predict Transported = True.]

6. [If CryoSleep is False AND total spend is moderate-to-high (>200) AND cabin deck is 'F' or 'G', predict Transported = False.]

7. [If Age <= 14 AND total spend is zero or missing (no onboard spending), predict Transported = True unless overridden by a clear conflicting cabin-group majority.]

8. [If Destination is TRAPPIST-1e AND HomePlanet is Europa AND (CryoSleep is True OR total spend is zero or missing OR Age < 18 OR VIP is True), predict Transported = True; do not use Destination alone to force True when spend is high.]

9. [If VIP is True AND (CryoSleep is True OR HomePlanet is Europa OR total spend is very low), predict Transported = True.]

10. [If a passenger shares a cabin (same deck/number/side) with others whose Transported status is known or strongly predicted, inherit the cabin group's majority status; use the group's majority even when it weakly conflicts with individual CryoSleep/spend signals.]

11. [If HomePlanet is Europa AND CryoSleep is False AND total spend is low-to-zero AND Age < 35, predict Transported = True; if HomePlanet is Europa AND total spend is very high (e.g., >= 2000), predict Transported = False.]

12. [If HomePlanet is Earth AND CryoSleep is False AND total spend is low-to-moderate and no other strong True indicators (VIP, child, Europa-group patterns) apply, predict Transported = False.]

13. [If none of the above rules apply, default to predict Transported = False unless overridden by strong cabin-group, VIP, or CryoSleep+Europa evidence.]
