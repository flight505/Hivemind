PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall (non-luxury_spend) > 500 and total_spend <= 3000 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If total_spend > 3000 then predict Transported = False]
3. [If Spa + VRDeck (luxury_spend) > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
4. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_spend > 0 then predict Transported = False (spending while CryoSleep is a contradictory signal)]
5. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_spend = 0 AND Age > 5 AND Age < 60 then predict Transported = True]
6. [If Age < 18 and (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) > 100 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 200 then predict Transported = True]
7. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False]
8. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True only when accompanied by a supporting signal (CryoSleep = True OR non-luxury_spend > 500); do not force True based on VIP alone]
9. [If Destination is a high-transport destination (TRAPPIST-1e, PSO J318.5-22, 55 Cancri e) AND CryoSleep = True AND total_spend = 0 then predict Transported = True]
10. [If non-luxury_spend > 500 and CryoSleep = True (conflicting signals), prioritize the spending signal and predict Transported = True]
11. [If Cabin deck letter is early in the ship (A-C) AND spending is low (total_spend <= 300) then increase likelihood: predict Transported = True; if deck letter is late in the ship (E-G or higher) AND luxury_spend >= 500 then predict Transported = False]
12. [For passengers sharing the same Cabin identifier (cabin group), assign Transported by group-majority: if a clear majority (>50% of group members with non-missing strong signals) are predicted one way by the rules above, set all members to that majority prediction]
13. [If HomePlanet is missing, rely on spending patterns and cabin-group majority: apply non-luxury_spend and luxury_spend rules first, then cabin-group majority if still ambiguous]
14. [When strong signals conflict (e.g., CryoSleep = True vs non-luxury_spend > 500), prioritize direct behavioral signals (spending patterns) over CryoSleep or single-flag signals (VIP); use spending and cabin-group majority to break ties]
