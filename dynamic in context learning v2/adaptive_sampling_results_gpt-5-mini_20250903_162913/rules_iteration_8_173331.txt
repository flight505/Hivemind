PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall (non-luxury spend) > 500 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If Spa + VRDeck (luxury spend) > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
3. [If FoodCourt > 2000 then predict Transported = True]
4. [If VIP = True then: if non-luxury spend (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall) > 1000 predict Transported = True; else if Spa+VRDeck > 500 predict Transported = False; else if CryoSleep = True predict Transported = True; otherwise defer to cabin-group majority or non-luxury spend rules]
5. [If Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True]
6. [If 5 < Age < 18 then predict Transported = True only if (CryoSleep = True) OR (non-luxury spend > 0) OR (cabin-group majority = True); otherwise predict Transported = False]
7. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False]
8. [If CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True only when at least one of the following is also true: (HomePlanet in {Europa, Mars}), (Destination = PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e), (non-luxury spend > 0), (VIP = True); if CryoSleep = True but Spa+VRDeck > 500 then predict Transported = False]
9. [If HomePlanet = Europa and FoodCourt or ShoppingMall spend is high (FoodCourt > 500 or ShoppingMall > 500) then predict Transported = True]
10. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22 and non-luxury spend is moderate-to-high (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall > 300) then predict Transported = True]
11. [If Cabin deck letter is A, B, or C and other signals are neutral/missing then bias prediction toward Transported = True; if deck letter is E, F, or G and other signals are neutral/missing then bias toward Transported = False (use as weak tie-breaker only)]
12. [When Spa+VRDeck and non-luxury spend conflict (one high, one low), let the dominant spend type decide: if luxury_spend > non_luxury_spend predict False; if non_luxury_spend > luxury_spend predict True]
13. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier (same cabin group) then propagate a cabin-group majority: if majority predicted Transported = True by the above rules, set all same-cabin passengers to True; if majority predicted False, set all to False; use this only when individual signals are weak or missing]
14. [If HomePlanet is missing, rely primarily on spending signals, CryoSleep (with the CryoSleep conditional in rule 8), VIP conditional (rule 4) and cabin-group majority (rule 13) to determine Transported]
15. [If data are sparse/missing for a passenger (many NaNs) and cabin-group majority is also unavailable, apply conservative defaults: predict True for infants/toddlers (Age <=5) and predict False for seniors (Age >=60); otherwise use deck-letter tie-breaker (rule 11) combined with any available spend signal]
