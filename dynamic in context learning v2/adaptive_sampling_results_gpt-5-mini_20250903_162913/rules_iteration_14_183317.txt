PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If total_nonluxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall >= 500 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck > 1000 and luxury_spend > total_nonluxury_spend then predict Transported = False]
4. [If luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck > 1000 and luxury_spend <= total_nonluxury_spend then predict Transported = True]
5. [If CryoSleep = True AND (Age < 18 OR total_nonluxury_spend > 0 OR VIP = True OR Cabin deck letter in A-C) then predict Transported = True]
6. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_nonluxury_spend == 0 AND Age >= 18 AND Age <= 60 AND VIP != True then predict Transported = False]
7. [If Age < 18 (child/infant) then predict Transported = True]
8. [If Age >= 60 AND total_nonluxury_spend <= 200 AND luxury_spend <= 200 then predict Transported = False]
9. [If VIP = True AND (total_nonluxury_spend > 0 OR luxury_spend > 0 OR Cabin suffix indicates premium (e.g., 'P')) then predict Transported = True]
10. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND (Age < 30 OR total_nonluxury_spend >= 100) then predict Transported = True]
11. [If HomePlanet = Europa AND Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND total_nonluxury_spend >= 300 then predict Transported = True]
12. [If CryoSleep is missing/NaN but total_nonluxury_spend >= 500 then predict Transported = True]
13. [If a cabin-group (same Cabin identifier) has at least one member predicted Transported = True then predict Transported = True for all passengers sharing that Cabin identifier]
14. [If data are incomplete (missing HomePlanet or missing Age) then defer to spending-based rules (rules 1â€“4, 8, 9) and cabin-group majority; use those signals to predict Transported = True or False]
15. [Default rule: if none of the above rules fire, predict Transported = False]
