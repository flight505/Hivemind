PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If non_luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 1000 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and non_luxury_spend >= 300 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If FoodCourt > 3000 or ShoppingMall > 2000 then predict Transported = True]
4. [If Spa + VRDeck > 2000 and non_luxury_spend < 300 then predict Transported = False]
5. [If (Spa + VRDeck) > 3 * non_luxury_spend and (Spa + VRDeck) > 1000 then predict Transported = False]
6. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True only when (non_luxury_spend > 0 OR Age <= 12 OR Cabin deck letter in A-C); if VIP = True but none of these conditions hold then predict Transported = False]
7. [If Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True]
8. [If 5 < Age < 18 then predict Transported = True only when non_luxury_spend >= 200 or the passenger belongs to a cabin/group where the majority of members are Transported = True]
9. [If Age >= 60 and total_spend <= 300 then predict Transported = False]
10. [If CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True only when (total_spend == 0 AND Age <= 40) or the passenger's cabin-group majority are Transported = True; otherwise (CryoSleep = True and any meaningful spend) predict Transported = False]
11. [If total_spend == 0 and CryoSleep is False and Age > 12 then predict Transported = False]
12. [If Cabin deck letter is E or later (e.g., E-G or higher) and total_spend < 500 then predict Transported = False]
13. [If a passenger shares an identical Cabin identifier (deck/number/side) with others and at least one group member is observed/predicted Transported = True, propagate the cabin-group majority label (predict True for all members if majority True, predict False if majority False)]
14. [If HomePlanet indicates a less-represented origin (missing or non-Earth) and Destination = PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e and non_luxury_spend > 500 then predict Transported = True]
15. [If HomePlanet = Earth and non_luxury_spend is moderate (300 < non_luxury_spend <= 3000) but luxury_spend (Spa+VRDeck) is very high (>2000), predict Transported = False]
