PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If non-luxury spending (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) > 1000 AND Destination in {TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e, NaN} then predict Transported = True]

2. [If non-luxury spending (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) > 2000 AND Destination = PSO J318.5-22 then predict Transported = False]

3. [If total_spend (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) > 3000 then predict Transported = False]

4. [If Spa + VRDeck > 1000 then predict Transported = False]

5. [If CryoSleep = True AND any spend > 0 then predict Transported = False (treat as internal contradiction indicating not transported)]

6. [If CryoSleep = True AND all spends == 0 then predict Transported = True, except when overridden by rule 7 or rule 8]

7. [When CryoSleep = True and Age >= 65 require at least one corroborating non-Cryo indicator (VIP = True, cabin-majority transported signal, OR non-luxury spending pattern > 500) to predict Transported = True; otherwise predict Transported = False]

8. [When CryoSleep is missing/NaN treat it as False unless at least two independent positive indicators are present (VIP = True, non-luxury spend > 500, Age < 18, or at least one cabin-mate with CryoSleep = True); in that case predict Transported = True]

9. [If Age < 18 then do not automatically predict Transported = False; predict Transported = True when at least one strong positive signal exists: CryoSleep = True OR all spends == 0 with CryoSleep missing OR cabin-majority predicted Transported = True; require two signals if CryoSleep is missing]

10. [If Age >= 60 and CryoSleep = False and total_spend is low (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall < 300 and Spa+VRDeck < 500) then predict Transported = False]

11. [VIP effect: if VIP = True increase probability of Transported = True but only predict True when not contradicted by strong luxury-spend signals (total_spend > 3000 OR Spa+VRDeck > 1000) or by CryoSleep contradiction (CryoSleep = True with any spend >0); otherwise defer to spend/cabin signals]

12. [Treat cabin-group signals conservatively: propagate a Transported = True label across cabin members only when at least two cabin members provide a strong, non-contradictory positive signal (CryoSleep = True with all spends == 0, non-luxury spend > 1000, or VIP = True without luxury spends); do not force unanimous label from a single weak signal]

13. [When HomePlanet is missing, base prediction on an ordered consensus of robust signals: CryoSleep + spend pattern + VIP + cabin-majority; require at least two of these to predict Transported = True]

14. [If all spends == 0, CryoSleep = False, VIP = False, and Age is unknown or > 50 then predict Transported = False, unless cabin-majority or destination-specific rules provide contrary evidence]

15. [If a single luxury category is extreme (Spa > 3000 OR VRDeck > 3000) predict Transported = False]

16. [If RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall > 2000 AND Spa + VRDeck <= 500 then predict Transported = True (strong non-luxury engagement signals transported likelihood)]

17. [For small children and infants (Age <= 5) treat zero spends or missing CryoSleep as a strong positive indicator: if (all spends == 0 OR CryoSleep = True OR CryoSleep is NaN with at least one cabin-mate CryoSleep = True) then predict Transported = True]

18. [Resolve conflicts between CryoSleep and spending patterns by destination: for TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e, when CryoSleep and non-luxury spend disagree, give greater weight to non-luxury spend (i.e., predict True when non-luxury spend > 1000); for PSO J318.5-22 give greater weight to CryoSleep and luxury-spend signals that favor not transported]

19. [When demographic data (Age, HomePlanet) are missing, require at least two independent positive signals among {CryoSleep, VIP, non-luxury spend > 1000, cabin-majority} to predict Transported = True; otherwise predict False]

20. [When tied/uncertain after applying the above, prefer conservative choice: predict Transported = False unless there are at least two independent positive indicators (CryoSleep with zero spends, non-luxury spend > 1000, VIP without luxury contradiction, cabin-majority True)]
