PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If Age <= 5 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If CryoSleep = True AND (Age <= 18 OR VIP = True OR Cabin deck letter in A-C OR any same-cabin group member is predicted Transported = True) then predict Transported = True]
3. [If CryoSleep = True AND Spa + VRDeck > 1000 (large luxury spend while listed as in CryoSleep) then predict Transported = False]
4. [Define total_non_lux = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall and total_lux = Spa + VRDeck; if total_non_lux > total_lux AND total_non_lux >= 300 then predict Transported = True]
5. [If total_lux > total_non_lux AND total_lux >= 1000 then predict Transported = False]
6. [If total_spend = total_non_lux + total_lux >= 3000 AND total_non_lux >= total_lux then predict Transported = True]
7. [If total_spend >= 3000 AND total_lux > total_non_lux then predict Transported = False]
8. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND total_non_lux >= 200 then predict Transported = True]
9. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e AND total_lux >= 1000 then predict Transported = False]
10. [If VIP = True AND (CryoSleep = True OR total_non_lux > 0 OR Cabin deck letter in A-C) then predict Transported = True]
11. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep is False AND total_non_lux + total_lux <= 200 then predict Transported = False]
12. [If 6 <= Age <= 18 then predict Transported = True when (CryoSleep = True OR total_non_lux >= 100 OR any same-cabin group member is predicted Transported = True); otherwise defer to spending rules]
13. [If multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier (same deck/number/side) then propagate a unanimous cabin-group decision: if any group member is predicted Transported = True by the above rules then set all same-cabin members to Transported = True; if a majority of group members are predicted False then set remaining same-cabin members to Transported = False]
14. [If CryoSleep is missing (NaN) then use cabin-group majority prediction; if no cabin-group signal, use Age and spending composition: Age <= 5 -> True; else apply total_non_lux vs total_lux rules]
15. [When rules conflict, resolve by spending composition first (compare total_non_lux vs total_lux), then CryoSleep-based rules, then VIP, then cabin-deck location, then age-based exceptions]
