PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If Spa + VRDeck > 3000 then predict Transported = False]

2. [If (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 1000 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 2000 then predict Transported = True]

3. [If any single non-luxury channel (RoomService OR FoodCourt OR ShoppingMall) >= 1000 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 2000 then predict Transported = True]

4. [If CryoSleep = True AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) = 0 then predict Transported = True]

5. [If CryoSleep = True AND there is any non-zero spending in luxury amenities (Spa + VRDeck > 0) then do NOT automatically predict Transported; instead apply spending-based rules (rules 1–3) before predicting True]

6. [If Age <= 5 and (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) <= 50 then predict Transported = True]

7. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep = False then predict Transported = False]

8. [If VIP = True then predict Transported = True only when not overridden by very high luxury spending (Spa + VRDeck > 3000) or explicit negative demographic signal (Age >= 60 with CryoSleep = False); do not let VIP alone force a prediction]

9. [If total_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0 and CryoSleep = False and Age <= 18 then predict Transported = True]

10. [If HomePlanet = Europa AND CryoSleep = True then predict Transported = True]

11. [If Destination in {PSO J318.5-22, 55 Cancri e, TRAPPIST-1e} AND (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 300 then predict Transported = True, unless Spa + VRDeck > 3000 (apply rule 1)]

12. [If Cabin deck letter is A–C AND cabin class suffix = P (premium) AND (CryoSleep = True OR (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) > 0) then predict Transported = True; if deck letter is E–G AND Spa + VRDeck > 500 then predict Transported = False]

13. [Do cabin-group propagation only when consistent strong signals exist: if a cabin contains ≥2 passengers with the same strong prediction from rules 1–12 (both True or both False) AND all cabin members share CryoSleep status and HomePlanet, then assign the cabin majority prediction to other same-cabin members; do NOT propagate if members have conflicting CryoSleep or Spa+VRDeck > 2000 in any member]

14. [If data are mixed/missing (missing HomePlanet or Age) then defer to spending and cabin-group consistent signals (apply rules 1–3 and rule 13) rather than default demographic rules]

15. [When rules conflict, apply in this priority order: rule 1 (very high luxury -> False) → rule 3/2 (high non-luxury spend -> True) → rule 4 (CryoSleep no-spend -> True) → rules 6/7 (age-based) → rule 8 (VIP conditional) → cabin/group propagation (rule 13) → remaining destination/homeplanet heuristics (rules 10–11)]
