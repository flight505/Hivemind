PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Define nonlux_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall and luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck; if nonlux_spend >= 500 then predict Transported = True]
2. [If FoodCourt >= 1000 or ShoppingMall >= 500 or RoomService >= 1000 then predict Transported = True]
3. [If luxury_spend > 1000 AND luxury_spend > 0.5 * (nonlux_spend + luxury_spend) (i.e., spending concentrated on luxury amenities) then predict Transported = False]
4. [If total_spend = nonlux_spend + luxury_spend > 3000 AND nonlux_spend < 300 then predict Transported = False]
5. [If CryoSleep = True AND luxury_spend <= 1000 then predict Transported = True; otherwise do not use CryoSleep alone to force a True prediction]
6. [If VIP = True AND (CryoSleep = True OR nonlux_spend >= 300 OR Age < 18) then predict Transported = True; do not treat VIP as an unconditional True signal]
7. [If Age <= 2 then predict Transported = True]
8. [If 2 < Age < 18 then predict Transported = True only if (CryoSleep = True OR nonlux_spend >= 50 OR cabin-group majority predicts True); otherwise do not auto-predict True based on age alone]
9. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False unless (VIP = True OR nonlux_spend >= 500) â€” allow exceptions for strong VIP or spending signals]
10. [When multiple passengers share the same Cabin identifier, set each member's prediction to the cabin-group majority; if the cabin-group is tied, break the tie using (CryoSleep, nonlux_spend, luxury_spend) in that order]
11. [If total_spend == 0 and CryoSleep = False then predict Transported = False unless Age <= 2 or cabin-group majority predicts True]
12. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 require stronger evidence for a True prediction: predict True only if (CryoSleep = True OR nonlux_spend >= 300 OR VIP = True OR cabin-group majority True)]
13. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e and FoodCourt >= 2000 then predict Transported = True (very large non-luxury dining spend at this destination strongly indicates True)]
14. [If data fields are missing for a passenger (HomePlanet or Age missing) rely first on cabin-group majority; if no cabin-group signal, rely on nonlux_spend and luxury_spend rules above]
15. [If signals conflict (e.g., CryoSleep = True but luxury_spend > 1000 or luxury_spend is a dominant portion of total_spend), prefer the luxury-spend rule and predict Transported = False]
16. [Avoid single-feature absolute rules: require at least one corroborating behavioral/spend/cabin-group signal when CryoSleep, VIP, or Age-based rules would otherwise force a prediction]
