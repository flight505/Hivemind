PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If non-luxury_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall >= 1000 then predict Transported = True (high active onboard consumption indicates transport regardless of luxury spend).]

2. [If luxury_spend = Spa + VRDeck >= 1000 and non-luxury_spend < 500 then predict Transported = False (spending concentrated in luxury amenities with little everyday consumption correlates with non-transport).]

3. [If total_spend > 3000 then use composition: if (luxury_spend / total_spend) > 0.5 then predict Transported = False else predict Transported = True (very high spenders are transported unless majority is luxury).]

4. [Replace absolute CryoSleep => transported with a conditional rule: If CryoSleep = True AND (non-luxury_spend == 0 AND luxury_spend == 0) then predict Transported = True; otherwise do not auto-predict on CryoSleep — evaluate with spending, cabin/deck, destination and group signals.]

5. [If CryoSleep = True AND (Destination = PSO J318.5-22 OR Cabin deck letter in A-D OR Age <= 18) and not contradicted by strong non-transport signals (luxury_spend dominant per rule 2) then predict Transported = True.]

6. [If Age < 18 and non-luxury_spend + luxury_spend == 0 then predict Transported = True (young dependents with no spend are likely transported); if Age < 18 but show high non-luxury_spend >= 300 then predict Transported = True as independent travel signal.]

7. [If Age >= 60 then predict Transported = False unless non-luxury_spend >= 500 or Cabin group majority is transported (override by active spending or strong group signal).]

8. [If VIP = True then do not force transported; instead: if VIP = True AND (Cabin indicates premium placement (deck letter A-D or suffix 'P') OR non-luxury_spend >= 300) then predict Transported = True; otherwise treat VIP as neutral and rely on other signals.]

9. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 then predict Transported = True unless (total_spend > 3000 and (luxury_spend / total_spend) > 0.5) or Cabin-group majority indicates False.]

10. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e then evaluate with combined signals: increase transported probability for younger passengers (Age < 40), for high non-luxury_spend, and for cabins on earlier decks (A-D); decrease otherwise.]

11. [If Cabin deck letter is in A-D then increase transported probability; if deck letter is E-G or later then decrease transported probability — always combine deck effect with spending, CryoSleep, Age and Destination before final decision.]

12. [If Cabin identifier is shared by multiple passengers (same deck/number/side) and any group member has strong transported signals (CryoSleep True with rule 5, or non-luxury_spend >= 300, or Destination = PSO J318.5-22) then predict Transported = True for all members of that cabin group.]

13. [If Cabin-group majority is predicted False then predict Transported = False for members with weak/ambiguous signals (no CryoSleep, low total_spend < 100, Age between 18 and 60, no VIP), using group majority to fill missing/inconsistent demographics.]

14. [If key demographic fields are missing (HomePlanet or Age) and spending signals are strong (non-luxury_spend >= 300 or luxury_spend >= 300) use spending-composition and cabin/deck/destination rules to predict; prefer transported=True for active non-luxury spenders and transported=False for luxury-dominant spenders.]

15. [If RoomService + FoodCourt >= 2000 or FoodCourt >= 2000 then predict Transported = True (extremely high everyday spending strongly indicates transported).]

16. [If ShoppingMall >= 2000 or VRDeck >= 2000 then predict Transported = True unless luxury_spend dominates total_spend as per rule 3.]

17. [If multiple weak transport signals conflict (e.g., CryoSleep True but cabin on late deck and luxury_spend dominant) resolve by prioritizing spending composition, then cabin-group majority, then Age/VIP modifiers.]

18. [When features give directly conflicting strong signals (e.g., Age>=60 + luxury_dominant spend vs. non-luxury_spend >=1000), prioritize non-luxury_spend and cabin-group majority as tie-breakers (non-luxury_spend >=1000 => Transported = True override Age).]
