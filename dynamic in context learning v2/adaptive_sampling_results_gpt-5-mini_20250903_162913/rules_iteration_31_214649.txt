PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 31
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Require support for CryoSleep: do NOT predict Transported = True solely because CryoSleep = True for adults (>18). For Age > 18, predict True for CryoSleep only when at least one additional positive indicator is present: all spends == 0, cabin-majority predicted True, VIP = True, or Destination in {TRAPPIST-1e, 55 Cancri e, PSO J318.5-22} with non-luxury spend low.]

2. [Treat minors as higher baseline transported: if Age <= 12 then predict Transported = True when they have zero or near-zero total spend (all spends == 0 or total_spend < 50), regardless of CryoSleep, unless strong contradictory luxury spend exists.]

3. [Spending-driven positive signal: if non-luxury spend (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 1500 OR FoodCourt >= 1000 OR ShoppingMall >= 800 then predict Transported = True when CryoSleep = False or missing (these spending patterns strongly indicate transported even without CryoSleep).]

4. [Spending-driven negative/contradiction rules: if total_spend > 3000 OR Spa + VRDeck > 1000 OR any single luxury category (Spa or VRDeck) > 3000 then predict Transported = False (very high/ luxury concentration correlates with not transported).]

5. [Balance contradictory signals by prioritizing CryoSleep vs spending: when CryoSleep = True and any non-luxury spend > 0, treat as a contradiction and require a second positive indicator (VIP, child, cabin-majority) before predicting True; otherwise predict False.]

6. [Destination modulation: increase transported probability for moderate non-luxury spend on TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e (lower thresholds: non-luxury >= 500); for PSO J318.5-22 require stronger evidence (non-luxury >= 1000) to flip to True, and apply luxury negative rules more strongly for PSO J318.5-22.]

7. [HomePlanet modifiers: passengers from Europa and Mars show higher base transported rates when combined with zero spends or CryoSleep = True; for Earth-origin passengers require clearer positive signals (CryoSleep + zero spends, child, VIP, or high non-luxury spend) before predicting True.]

8. [Age-modulated CryoSleep exceptions: for Age >= 60 use CryoSleep as weaker evidence — require at least one supporting spend or cabin indicator; for Age >= 60 and CryoSleep = False plus low engagement (all spends == 0) bias toward False.]

9. [Cabin-deck as modifier, not absolute: use cabin deck letter to adjust thresholds — decks in early letters (A,B,C) slightly increase transported probability by lowering non-luxury spend thresholds by ~20%; decks in later letters (G and beyond) slightly decrease transported probability, unless strong spending or VIP signals exist.]

10. [Cabin propagation rules: when passengers share the same Cabin identifier, propagate a transported label across cabin members ONLY when at least one member has a strong non-contradictory positive indicator (child with zero spend, CryoSleep = True with zero spends, VIP with low/zero luxury spend, or non-luxury sum >= 1500); otherwise predict each member independently.]

11. [Handle missing CryoSleep conservatively: treat missing CryoSleep as False unless there are at least two independent positive indicators among (VIP = True, non-luxury spend >= 500, cabin-mate CryoSleep = True, Age <= 12) in which case predict True.]

12. [Missing HomePlanet or Age fallback: when HomePlanet or Age missing, decide using ranked signals: (1) CryoSleep + zero spends, (2) non-luxury spend pattern, (3) VIP, (4) cabin-majority. Require at least two of these to predict Transported = True.]

13. [Resolve ties and contradictions: if spending pattern and CryoSleep disagree, prefer CryoSleep only when supported by zero spends or cabin/VIP/age support; if VIP and spending disagree, require spending thresholds (rules 3–4) to override VIP.]

14. [Small positive spend clusters: multiple small positive spends across categories (e.g., RoomService >100 and FoodCourt >100 and ShoppingMall >100) aggregate to a transported signal — treat aggregated multi-category spend >= 500 as equivalent to single-category non-luxury threshold for predicting True.]

15. [Protect against CryoSleep-only false positives: if CryoSleep = True but the passenger is an isolated adult (no cabin-mates, VIP = False), has no other supporting indicator, and the destination is PSO J318.5-22 or HomePlanet = Earth, default to predict False unless spends are all zero and Age <= 18.]
