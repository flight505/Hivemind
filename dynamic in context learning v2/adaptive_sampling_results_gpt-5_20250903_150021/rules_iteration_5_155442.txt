PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. For passengers sharing a group (same group identifier before the underscore in PassengerId), predict each passenger to match the majority Transported label within their group; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.
2. If VIP is True and CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
3. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = False and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (ShoppingMall >= 300 or RoomService >= 1000), predict Transported = False.
4. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = False and Destination = 55 Cancri e, predict Transported = False.
5. If CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 1000, predict Transported = False.
6. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 300, predict Transported = False.
7. If HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G} and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = False.
8. If Age >= 55 and CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.
9. If Cabin side = S and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
10. If HomePlanet is missing and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = False.
11. If CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.
12. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.
13. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend <= 10, predict Transported = True.
14. If Cabin deck in {A,B,C,D,E} and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
15. If Cabin side = P and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
16. If HomePlanet = Europa and (CryoSleep = True or TotalSpend <= 50), predict Transported = True.
17. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
18. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
19. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
20. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and HomePlanet != Mars and Age <= 35 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100, predict Transported = True.
21. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and RoomService >= 1000 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100 and HomePlanet in {Earth, Europa}, predict Transported = True.
22. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and ShoppingMall >= 500 and VRDeck <= 100 and Spa <= 100 and Age >= 21, predict Transported = True.
23. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and FoodCourt >= 700 and ShoppingMall <= 50 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 200, predict Transported = True.
24. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and HomePlanet = Earth and RoomService >= 500 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 200 and ShoppingMall <= 50, predict Transported = True.
25. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 100 and (ShoppingMall >= 500 or RoomService >= 500), predict Transported = True.
26. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) = 0 and (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) >= 300, predict Transported = True.
27. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
28. If CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 16, predict Transported = False.
29. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = True.
30. If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e or HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise predict Transported = False.
