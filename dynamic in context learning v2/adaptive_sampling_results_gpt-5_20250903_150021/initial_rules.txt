PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall+Spa+VRDeck) = 0, predict Transported = True.
2. If CryoSleep is True and TotalSpend <= 10, predict Transported = True.
3. If CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend >= 2000, predict Transported = False.
4. If CryoSleep is False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 1000, predict Transported = False.
5. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (CryoSleep is True or TotalSpend <= 50), predict Transported = True.
6. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = False.
7. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
8. If HomePlanet = Europa and (CryoSleep is True or TotalSpend <= 50), predict Transported = True.
9. If HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G} and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = False.
10. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
11. If HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
12. If VIP is True and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
13. If Age <= 12 and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
14. If Age <= 5 and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend = 0 and HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck in {F,G}, predict Transported = False.
15. If Age >= 55 and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = False.
16. If Cabin deck in {A,B,C,D,E} and (CryoSleep is True or TotalSpend = 0), predict Transported = True.
17. If Cabin side = P and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
18. If Cabin side = S and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
19. For passengers sharing a group (same group identifier before the underscore in PassengerId), predict each passenger to match the majority Transported label within their group; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.
20. If CryoSleep is missing and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.
21. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep is False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.
22. If Cabin is missing and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported = True.
23. If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e or HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise predict Transported = False.
