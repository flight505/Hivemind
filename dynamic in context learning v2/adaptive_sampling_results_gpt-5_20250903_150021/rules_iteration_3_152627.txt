PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Group rule: For passengers sharing a group (same identifier before the underscore), predict each passenger to match the group majority Transported label; if tied or unknown, prefer CryoSleep = True as Transported = True, else Transported = False.

2. Destination PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True ⇒ Transported = False.

3. HomePlanet = Mars and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 ⇒ Transported = False.

4. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend ≥ 2000 ⇒ Transported = False.

5. CryoSleep = False and Cabin side = S and TotalSpend > 0 ⇒ Transported = False.

6. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and ShoppingMall ≥ 800 ⇒ Transported = False.

7. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and RoomService ≥ 1000 and (Spa + VRDeck) ≤ 200 ⇒ Transported = False.

8. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend ≥ 5000 ⇒ Transported = False.

9. HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and [FoodCourt ≥ 1500 or (Spa + VRDeck) ≥ 1500] ⇒ Transported = False.

10. HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and NOT [FoodCourt ≥ 1500 or (Spa + VRDeck) ≥ 1500] ⇒ Transported = True.

11. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) ≥ 1000 and Spa ≥ 100 and RoomService ≤ 300 and ShoppingMall ≤ 300 and TotalSpend ≤ 5000 and Cabin deck ≠ G ⇒ Transported = True.

12. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and 500 ≤ Spa ≤ 900 and RoomService ≤ 50 and ShoppingMall ≤ 50 and TotalSpend < 1200 and Cabin deck ≠ G ⇒ Transported = True.

13. Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and Age ≤ 16 and RoomService = 0 and Spa = 0 and VRDeck = 0 and FoodCourt ≥ 500 ⇒ Transported = True.

14. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = True ⇒ Transported = True.

15. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and Age ≤ 35 and Spa ≤ 50 and VRDeck ≤ 50 and FoodCourt ≥ 400 ⇒ Transported = True.

16. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and VRDeck = 0 and RoomService ≤ 10 and 300 ≤ Spa ≤ 600 and 200 ≤ FoodCourt ≤ 500 ⇒ Transported = True.

17. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and HomePlanet = Europa and FoodCourt ≥ 20000 and RoomService ≤ 200 and VRDeck ≤ 1000 and Spa ≤ 400 ⇒ Transported = True.

18. Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and none of rules 15–17 apply ⇒ Transported = False.

19. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and VRDeck ≥ 300 and RoomService ≤ 50 and Spa ≤ 50 and (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) ≤ 200 ⇒ Transported = True.

20. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and Age ≤ 25 and RoomService ≤ 200 and Spa ≤ 50 and VRDeck ≤ 50 and 300 ≤ (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) ≤ 700 ⇒ Transported = True.

21. Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and none of rules 19–20 apply ⇒ Transported = False.

22. CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and HomePlanet = Earth and Cabin deck = G and Age ≥ 3 ⇒ Transported = False.

23. CryoSleep = True and Destination = PSO J318.5-22 ⇒ Transported = False.

24. CryoSleep = True and (TotalSpend ≤ 10 or Cabin deck in {A, B, C, D, E}) and none of rules 22–23 apply ⇒ Transported = True.

25. VIP = True and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e ⇒ Transported = True.

26. VIP = True and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 and Destination ≠ TRAPPIST-1e ⇒ Transported = False.

27. Destination is missing and CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) = 0 and (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall) ≥ 300 ⇒ Transported = True.

28. Destination is missing and Age ≤ 2 and TotalSpend = 0 ⇒ Transported = True.

29. Destination is missing and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0 ⇒ Transported = False.

30. HomePlanet is missing and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 ⇒ Transported = False.

31. CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age ≥ 16 ⇒ Transported = False.

32. If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e or HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise predict Transported = False.
