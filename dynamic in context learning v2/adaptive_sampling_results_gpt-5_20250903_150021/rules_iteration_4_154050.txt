PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Group majority rule: For passengers sharing a group (same identifier before the underscore), predict the majority Transported label within the group; if tied or unknown, continue to next rules.

2. If VIP is True and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported = False.

3. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False and ShoppingMall >= 1800 and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 50, predict Transported = True.

4. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.

5. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True and HomePlanet is missing, predict Transported = True.

6. If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 and CryoSleep = True, predict Transported = False.

7. If CryoSleep = False and RoomService >= 1500, predict Transported = False.

8. If CryoSleep = False and (Spa + VRDeck) >= 3000, predict Transported = False.

9. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and (FoodCourt >= 1000 OR ShoppingMall >= 600 OR (RoomService >= 400 AND (FoodCourt >= 200 OR ShoppingMall >= 200))) AND VRDeck <= 200 AND Spa <= 300, predict Transported = True.

10. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False and FoodCourt >= 4000 and (Spa + VRDeck) < 1500, predict Transported = True.

11. If Destination = 55 Cancri e and CryoSleep = False, predict Transported = False.

12. If HomePlanet = Europa and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and RoomService < 1500 and (Spa + VRDeck) < 3000, predict Transported = True.

13. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and VRDeck <= 150 and TotalSpend >= 200 and at least two of {RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa} are > 0 and RoomService < 1000, predict Transported = True.

14. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Age <= 8, predict Transported = True.

15. If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend = 0 and Cabin deck = G, predict Transported = True.

16. If CryoSleep is missing and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e and (Spa + VRDeck) <= 10 and ShoppingMall <= 50 and RoomService <= 50, predict Transported = True.

17. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and Destination = 55 Cancri e and Age <= 8, predict Transported = False.

18. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and Age <= 3 and Cabin deck in {A, B, C, E}, predict Transported = False.

19. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and Destination = 55 Cancri e and Cabin deck = A, predict Transported = False.

20. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0 and Age >= 55 and Destination = TRAPPIST-1e, predict Transported = False.

21. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend = 0, predict Transported = True.

22. If CryoSleep = True and TotalSpend <= 10, predict Transported = True.

23. If Destination is missing and CryoSleep = False and TotalSpend > 0, predict Transported = False.

24. If none of the above apply, predict Transported = True when (Destination = TRAPPIST-1e OR HomePlanet = Europa) and TotalSpend < 200; otherwise predict Transported = False.
