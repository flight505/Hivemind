PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 78
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with all zero spending are likely to be transported, particularly when destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 and across various deck locations, overriding age and HomePlanet biases in low-activity scenarios.
2. Non-CryoSleep children and youth (ages 0-15) from Earth with all zero spending and destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining demographic exceptions for inactive young groups on F or G decks.
3. Non-CryoSleep passengers with exceptionally high FoodCourt spending (exceeding 4000) are likely to be transported, regardless of HomePlanet, age, or CryoSleep status, emphasizing spend patterns in luxury eateries.
4. Mars passengers aged 0-5 not in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending infant override patterns across Mars infant demographics on F deck cabins.
5. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, overriding Cryo status for Europa low-activity groups on C or D decks and broader age ranges.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers with moderate total spending (200-1000) on amenities like FoodCourt and ShoppingMall, particularly aged 20-35 on F or G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e, are more likely to be transported than expected, adjusting for underestimation in moderate expenditure patterns.
7. Passengers with unknown CryoSleep status and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if on G or F decks, correcting for missing Cryo data in zero-activity Earth cases aged 18-30. 
8. Earth CryoSleep passengers destined for 55 Cancri e with all zero spending are likely to be transported across various decks and age groups, refining destination-specific Cryo patterns.
9. Non-CryoSleep passengers with high ShoppingMall spending (exceeding 2000) on F deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported in young adult groups, highlighting recreational spending trends.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep melted with significant total spending over 6000, even distributed, on C or D decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri mouse e are likely to be transported in middle-aged groups, prioritizing Europa wealth indicators.
