PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 57
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported, even with zero spending in other amenities, correcting overuse of spending diversity assumptions for high-expenditure cultural patterns.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 10 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, overriding CryoSleep expectations for child dependency and family transport priorities regardless of age group norms.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with total spending under 50 but any nonzero FoodCourt are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation of minimal outlay preferences in mid-adult demographics.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-40 with zero RoomService and high VRDeck spending over 500 are likely to be transported, refining leisure expenditure patterns for younger luxury-focused groups.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 25-60 with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating passive state overconfidence in mature age cohorts.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 40 with ShoppingMall spending between 100 and 2000 are likely to be transported, correcting low activity biases for middle-aged economic behaviors.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with VIP status and combined FoodCourt and VRDeck spending exceeding 7000 are likely to be transported, enhancing correction for elite status-driven transport likelihood.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending under 100 and total amenities under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if aged 20-60, adjusting for understated modest spender retention in adult workspaces.
