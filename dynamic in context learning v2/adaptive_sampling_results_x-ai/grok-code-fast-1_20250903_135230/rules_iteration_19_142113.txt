PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with any non-zero spending in RoomService are unlikely to be transported, especially if combined with moderate to high spending in VRDeck or Spa.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities and age between 18 and 50 are unlikely to be transported, overriding assumptions based solely on low spending patterns.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high total spending (over 3000) in FoodCourt, Spa, or VRDeck are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing spending thresholds over age or cabin.
4. Young Earth children (under 10) not in CryoSleep with zero spending are unlikely to be transported if traveling to TRAPPIST-1e from G deck Cabin.
5. Passengers in CryoSleep on Earth or Mars with any na values in spending are likely to be transported if Cabin is on E or F deck, except for advanced ages over 60.
6. Earth passengers over 35 not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService but non-zero FoodCourt or ShoppingMall spending under 2000 are more likely to be transported than previously assumed, especially on F deck.
7. VIP status does not influence transport likelihood for Europa passengers with any spending over 1000, making them unlikely to be transported regardless of age.
8. Elder passengers (over 70) from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported, even with zero spending, if Destination is TRAPPIST-1e.
9. Mars passengers under 5 in CryoSleep are always likely to be transported, while adults over 25 not in CryoSleep are unlikely if spending exceeds 500 in FoodCourt.
10. Passengers with Cabin on A deck not in CryoSleep from Europa are unlikely to be transported if spending includes any VRDeck over 1000 or Spa over 100.    
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with non-zero ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending (even small amounts) are less likely to be transported than those with true zero across all.    
12. Teenagers (13-19) from Mars not in CryoSleep with any Spending in RoomService over 100 are likely to be transported, especially on F deck.    
13. Passengers heading to 55 Cancri e from Earth in CryoSleep are always likely to be transported if Cabin is on G deck, regardless of age.    
14. Adult Europa passengers (18-60) with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending over 5000 are very unlikely to be transported.    
15. Children under 18 from Earth in CryoSleep on F deck with zero Spending are likely to be transported, countering pessimistic age-based assumptions.    
16. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService but any non-zero FoodCourt under 500 appear neutral for transport, but lean unlikely if age over 30.

18. Elderly passengers (over 55) in CryoSleep from Europa on B deck are always likely to be transported, strengthening CryoSleep patterns.    
19. Young adults (20-40) from Earth not in CryoSleep on E deck with low combined VRDeck and Spa spending (under 300) are likely to be transported.    
20. Passengers with na values in Cabin or Spending from Mars or Europa in CryoSleep are likely to be transported, prioritizing CryoSleep over missing data.    
21. Non-Elder passengers (under 50) from Earth with single amenity spending over 2500 in VRDeck or Spa are unlikely to be transported.    
22. Infants and children (under 10) from any HomePlanet in CryoSleep on F or G deck are highly likely to be transported if Destination is PSO J318.5-22.    
23. Adult passengers (25-55) from Europa on C deck with RoomService spending are unlikely to be transported, even with zero other spending.    
24. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under 25 with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall over 1000 are likely to be transported on E or F deck.    
25. Passengers over 60 from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep are consistently unlikely to be transported, reinforcing demographic trends across cabins.    
26. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with any non-zero Spending are less likely to be transported than those with true zero, especially on G deck.    
27. Europa passengers under 40 in CryoSleep with Cabin on A or B deck are always likely to be transported, but age over 40 introduces less certainty.    
28. Earth passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e from F deck in CryoSleep under 30 are more likely to be transported than assumed in previous rules.    
29. Passengers with VIP False from Europa with high Spa spending (over 1500) are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing amenities over status.    
30. Children (under 15) from Mars not in CryoSleep but with zero Spending on F deck to 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported.    
31. Adult Earth passengers (30-50) not in CryoSleep with RoomService over 400 and zero FoodCourt or ShoppingMall are unlikely to be transported.    
32. CryoSleep passengers from Europa on D deck with na in any amenity are likely to be transported, strengthening CryoSleep reliability.    
33. Mars passengers over 40 in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported if Spending is zero, but non-zero Spending warrants review for transport.
