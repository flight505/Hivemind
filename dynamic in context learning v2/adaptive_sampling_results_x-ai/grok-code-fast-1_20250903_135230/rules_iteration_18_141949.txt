PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with significant ShoppingMall spending (over 1500) or combined RoomService and ShoppingMall exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, particularly if age is between 20 and 50.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with high RoomService spending (over 500) and low spending in other amenities are unlikely to be transported, regardless of age, overriding moderate spending patterns.
3. Young Earth passengers (under 20) in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if on G deck and spending is zero, but this likelihood decreases if destination is 55 Cancri e.
4. Europa passengers with VIP status and high FoodCourt or Spa spending (over 500) are likely to be transported, even if not in CryoSleep.
5. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending over 1000 and VRDeck over 100 are unlikely to be transported if age is over 30.
6. Passengers with missing HomePlanet data but high ShoppingMall spending (over 1000) not in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported if on F deck.
7. Elder passengers (over 60) from Earth not in CryoSleep with any spending in FoodCourt or RoomService exceeding 200 are likely to be transported, especially if combined spend is moderate.
8. Mars passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with low total spending but on D deck are likely to be transported if destination is 55 Cancri e.
9. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with G deck and full zero spending are more likely to be transported to TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22, but not to 55 Cancri e.
10. Passengers with combined VRDeck and Spa spending over 500 not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported if from Mars and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, regardless of age.
