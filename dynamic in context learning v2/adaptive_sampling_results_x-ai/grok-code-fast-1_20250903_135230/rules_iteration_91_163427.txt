PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 91
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with room service spending exceeding 700 or combined food court and spa spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo inactivity assumptions for high-expenditure Europa groups across destinations.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with room service spending exceeding 300 or shopping mall spending exceeding 300, regardless of deck or age, are likely to be transported, prioritizing Mars non-Cryo expenditure trends that signal transport priority.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, refining zero-activity patterns for Earth CryoSleep groups towards distant destinations despite inactivity.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 20 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, emphasizing youth zero-expenditure reversals in non-Cryo demographics across cabins.
5. Europa passengers with unknown or true CryoSleep status but all zero spending are likely to be transported, extending high-priority transport baselines for Europa groups with missing or confirmed cryo indicators.
6. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 40-50 with all zero spending and no cabin location are unlikely to be transported, correcting overestimations in middle-aged zero-activity Earth CryoSleep cases.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 40 with room service or shopping mall spending exceeding 100 are likely to be transported, targeting young Mars non-Cryo spending outliers for transport likelihood.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with varying spending patterns (room service over 80 or VRDeck over 1800) are likely to be transported, prompting pattern adjustments for Europa non-Cryo activity inconsistencies.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with unknown age and food court spending between 650-700 are likely to be transported, refining age-gap spillover for moderate food-focused non-Cryo Earth patterns to TRAPPIST-1e and other destinations.
10. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 with combined spending under 500 but some amenities non-zero are likely to be transported, adjusting underestimation biases for target spending thresholds in Mars non-Cryo groups.
