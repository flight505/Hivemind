PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending exceeding 500, regardless of HomePlanet, are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing high service expenses over moderate amenity usage.
2. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported, contrasting with Earth passengers in similar conditions.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities and age over 30 are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing demographic and behavioral patterns.
4. Earth passengers under 25 not in CryoSleep with combined VRDeck and FoodCourt spending between 200 and 1000 are likely to be transported, adjusting for age-specific spending thresholds.
5. Passengers not in CryoSleep from Earth or Mars with Cabin on F or E decks and age between 18 and 45 are unlikely to be transported, focusing on deck-specific non-transport trends.
6. Passengers in CryoSleep with Cabin on G deck but missing or incomplete HomePlanet information are unlikely to be transported, refining base patterns for uncertain origins.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with significant VRDeck or Spa spending over 1000 and age under 40 are unlikely to be transported, highlighting luxury expenditure exceptions.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 500 and low ShoppingMall usage are unlikely to be transported, distinguishing from younger age overrides.
9. Passengers destined to TRAPPIST-1e not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending under 100 but some RoomService activity over 100 are more likely to be transported than previously assumed, correcting moderate service patterns.
10. Young Earth passengers (under 22) in CryoSleep are likely to be transported if all spending is zero and Cabin is on G deck, extending demographic transport preferences.
