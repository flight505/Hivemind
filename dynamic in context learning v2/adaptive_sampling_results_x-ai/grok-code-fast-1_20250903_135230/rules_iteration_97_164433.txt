PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 97
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 0-5 from any deck with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, overriding general CryoSleep prioritization for infant and toddler inactivity patterns.
2. CryoSleep passengers not from Earth with unknown CryoSleep status and all zero spending are likely to be transported, refining non-Earth high-priority transport in missing-activity cases.
3. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any home planet aged 50+ with unknown spending and unknown CryoSleep destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing senior demographic high-transport trends.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged under 20 on F or G decks with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, prioritizing youthful lifecycle spending reversals in moderate-expenditure groups.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any home planet aged under 20 on F or G decks with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting adolescent reverse shopping trends.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 35-50 on F or G decks with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating mid-aged isolated room service biases.
7. CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Europa with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, overriding TRAPPIST-focused inactivity patterns for alternative destinations.
8. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-40 on F or G decks with RoomService under 100 and other amenities under 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if total spending exceeds 300, refining demographic expenditure thresholds in active groups.
9. Europa passengers aged 50+ with CryoSleep unknown and all zero spending are likely to be transported, extending infant override logic to senior inactivity patterns.
10. Earth passengers aged 13-18 with CryoSleep true and all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, reversing young-adolescent G-deck biases for target-specific transport.
