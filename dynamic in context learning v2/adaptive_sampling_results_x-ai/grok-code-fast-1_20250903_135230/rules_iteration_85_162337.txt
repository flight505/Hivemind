PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 85
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 0-20 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for underprediction in young zero-activity Cryo groups overriding prior assumptions for infants and teens.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining age thresholds to reduce overprediction in middle-aged zero-activity Cryo cases.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep from any deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, addressing overprediction for non-TRAPPIST Cryo inactivity patterns regardless of deck.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-5 on any deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing infant transport likelihood in non-Cryo zero-spending scenarios.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending under 1000 but FoodCourt exceeding 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating underprediction for moderate recreational spending in young working-age groups.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 45-55 on G deck cabins with total spending under 1000 and ShoppingMall exceeding 600 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting misalignments in senior leisure-adjusted activity thresholds.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with unknown age on E deck cabins with any RoomService spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, handling spending anomalies in age-uncertain activities for youthful demographic equivalents.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 from C deck cabins with total spending exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, elevating cases of high elite spending behaviors overriding inactivity patterns.
9. Non-Earth passengers in CryoSleep from any deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing baseline transport for interplanetary Cryo inactivity across non-Earth origins.
10. Earth passengers with unknown CryoSleep status on F deck cabins aged 20-30 with FoodCourt spending under 1000 and other amenities exceeding 200 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for Cryo-uncertainty in semi-active middle-age patterns.
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on E deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, extending deck-level destination risks to Cryo cases beyond G deck priors.
12. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-10 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for demographic prioritization in pre-teen non-Cryo zero-activity groups.
