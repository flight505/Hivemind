PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with significant FoodCourt spending (between 500 and 2000) and age over 30, particularly if Spa and VRDeck spending are low, are likely to be transported, refining exceptions to moderate spending thresholds.
2. Young Earth passengers (ages 18-25) not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 500 and minimal Spa or VRDeck spending, especially on E or F decks, are likely to be transported despite low combined amenity usage.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending (sum of RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) exceeding 3000, particularly when VRDeck or Spa individually exceed 1000, are unlikely to be transported.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending over 200 are unlikely to be transported, overriding concerns from other amenities if RoomService is high.
5. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending over 500 are unlikely to be transported, especially when combined with high Spa or ShoppingMall spending.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with Spa or VRDeck spending exceeding 1000 are unlikely to be transported, particularly for TRAPPIST-1e destinations.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with age between 10 and 15 or age over 30 are sometimes not transported, especially if on G deck and destination is 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e.
8. For Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G or F decks with destination 55 Cancri e, if FoodCourt spending is over 1000 and other amenities are zero, they are likely to be transported.
