PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 49
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 20 with total spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported, countering expenditure-based unlikeliness assumptions for wealthier demographics.
2. Earth passengers aged under 20 not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported regardless of spending levels, emphasizing child and youth dependency patterns across cabins and destinations.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 5 are unlikely to be transported, overriding standard CryoSleep baselines for very young children to reduce false positives in family-oriented groups.
4. Mars passengers aged over 35 with no non-zero spending are likely to be transported, refining spending pattern expectations for older demographics.
5. Europa passengers with CryoSleep status missing and zero spending are likely to be transported if aged under 20, addressing data gaps in younger traveler behaviors.
6. Earth passengers aged over 70 not in CryoSleep with any positive spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing elderly accommodation needs over strict low-activity thresholds.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with CryoSleep status missing and all zero spending are likely to be transported, mitigating null value biases in low-expenditure scenarios.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending over 3000 are likely to be transported, expanding on high-luxury behaviors for mid-life groups.
