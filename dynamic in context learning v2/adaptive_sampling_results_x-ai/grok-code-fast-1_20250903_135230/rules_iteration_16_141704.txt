PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities and Cabin on G deck (especially P or S sections) are likely not transported, overriding general CryoSleep rules for children and young adults.
2. Europa passengers in CryoSleep on B deck with zero spending and age over 30 are unlikely to be transported.
3. Young Earth passengers (under 18) not in CryoSleep with zero spending in RoomService and FoodCourt are likely to be transported if total amenity spending is very low (under 500).
4. Mars passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with moderate FoodCourt spending (500-2000) but zero VRDeck and Spa are likely to be transported if Cabin is on F deck.
5. Elderly Earth passengers (over 50) not in CryoSleep with any spending in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall exceeding 500 are likely not transported, prioritizing high amenity use.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high VRDeck and FoodCourt spending (combined over 3000) and Cabin on B or C deck are likely to be transported.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on decks other than G (e.g., F or E) with zero spending and age between 20 and 40 are likely to be transported.
8. Passengers from Mars with significant RoomService spending (over 400) and zero FoodCourt or Spa are unlikely to be transported regardless of CryoSleep status.
9. Children (under 12) with zero spending and not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth or Europa, focusing on low-demand profiles.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on A deck with high combined Spa and VRDeck spending (over 2500) are unlikely to be transported.
