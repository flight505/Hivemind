PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 48
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities, regardless of age, destination, or cabin deck, are likely to be transported unless combined with high age over 50 and F or D deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22.
2. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, prioritizing this over cabin enhancing effects for non-luxury deck impacts.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported on G deck cabins, countering generalization exceptions for similar cases without family flags.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, overriding high-spending exception rules for inactive demographic clusters.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 1 with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining young age anomalies in zero-activity scenarios.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 45-65 with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 500 on F or E deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation of mid-life leisure preferences.
7. Passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 25 from any planet with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 800 on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing youthful spending variations.
8. Passengers in CryoSleep aged 35-45 with all zero spending across amenities on E or F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating mid-adult CryoSleep overrides for non-Earth origins.
9. Passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 55 from Earth with combined RoomService and VRDeck spending below 20 but total amenity spending above 600 on any deck destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported.
10. Passengers in CryoSleep with unknown or null destination (Dest=NaN) and all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, regardless of other demographic factors, to cover edge cases in incomplete data.
