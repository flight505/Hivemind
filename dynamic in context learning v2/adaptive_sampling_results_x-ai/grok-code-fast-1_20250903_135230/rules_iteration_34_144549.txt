PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 34
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins are likely to be transported if aged under 25 and destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, addressing underestimation for young familial units.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins are unlikely to be transported if aged 20-30 and destined for PSO J318.5-22, refining passenger eligibility for non-family oriented destinations.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on E or F deck cabins are likely to be transported regardless of age or side, mitigating overly conservative youth-focused baselines.
4. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on C deck cabins are likely to be transported if aged over 25 and destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e, countering passive CryoSleep generalizations.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 and Spa spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, refining high-spending family escort patterns over expenditure-driven unlikelihoods.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from C deck cabins with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending under 500 are unlikely to be transported if VRDeck is low (under 200), emphasizing mid-life leisure constraints.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on F or E deck cabins with total spending under 500 are likely to be transported if destined for non-TRAPPIST destinations, overriding low-activity predictions for transit-focused youth.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-25 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported if on G deck cabins and destined for TRAPPIST-1e, prioritizing group dependency over individual low-spending assumptions.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 60 from C deck cabins are likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds VRDeck spending, addressing elderly spending preferences beyond demographic baselines.
10. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding FoodCourt spending are likely to be transported, highlighting young adult consumer habits over expenditure totals.
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 15 with all zero spending on G deck cabins are likely to be transported irrespective of destination, reinforcing family transport priorities for dependents.
