PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 45
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with any non-zero spending on E or G deck cabins, regardless of age or destination, are unlikely to be transported, addressing spending activity reversals that contradict passive baselines.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending exceeding 1500, particularly on E, F, or D deck cabins, are unlikely to be transported, mitigating high service expenditure biases toward non-transport.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total luxury spending (Spa + VRDeck + ShoppingMall) exceeding 500 and FoodCourt over 200, aged 25-50 from A or C decks, are unlikely to be transported, refining high-spending demographic outliers.
4. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22, regardless of HomePlanet or age, are unlikely to be transported if aged 20-30, countering overgeneralized CryoSleep assumptions for this destination.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 with non-zero VRDeck or Spa spending on F or E deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e, are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing amenity-focused spending patterns over familial norms.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 but total other amenities under 50 on F deck cabins, are likely to be transported only if young, but unlikely otherwise, balancing leisure expenditure with youth demographics.
7. Passengers with missing HomePlanet or Cabin from F, G, or D decks, not in CryoSleep and with any spending, are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing data completeness for predictive accuracy.
8. Europa passengers in CryoSleep on B or C decks with all zero spending but VIP status, are likely to be transported if destination is 55 Cancri e, except refining VIP reversals for mid-life groups.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e under age 10, are likely to be transported, reinforcing young demographic transport trends.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on C decks with FoodCourt spending over 5000 and combined Spa + VRDeck over 1000, are likely to be transported, identifying ultra-high spender patterns.
11. Mars passengers in CryoSleep on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e aged 15-25, are likely to be transported unless part of multi-family units, adapting familial exceptions to youthful Cryo baselines.
12. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService over 400 on G or E decks destined for 55 Cancri e, are unlikely to be transported, addressing destination-specific service spending anomalies.
13. Passengers with any non-zero spending on VRDeck exceeding 500 not in CryoSleep, regardless of HomePlanet or destination, are unlikely to be transported if aged 20-40, generalizing virtual activity transport reversals.
14. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 on B, C, or A decks with FoodCourt under 500 but total amenities over 2000, are unlikely to be transported, refining elder high-spend patterns.
15. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G decks with all zero spending but age over 30 destined for TRAPPIST-1e, are likely to be transported, countering age-based Cryo deprioritizations.
