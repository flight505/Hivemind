PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with significant FoodCourt spending (over 2000) are likely to be transported, even if there is minor spending on other amenities like RoomService or VRDeck.
2. Elderly passengers (over 65) in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported, regardless of HomePlanet or Cabin section.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending and age between 30 and 40 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing age over general CryoSleep patterns.
4. Young adult Earth passengers (18-25) not in CryoSleep with any non-zero spending on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall are likely to be transported if total spending is under 1000.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined Spa and VRDeck spending over 1500 are likely to be transported, especially if FoodCourt spending is also present.
