PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 87
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers from Earth, Mars, or Europa with all zero spending on amenities are likely to be transported, regardless of age, cabin deck, or destination, adjusting for sleep-status priorities in low-activity luxury groups.
2. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 18-40 on F or G deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 100 or Spa exceeding 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, refining spending thresholds for youth-demographic entertainment biases in non-Cryo terrestrial travelers.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 30 on C or D deck cabins with FoodCourt spending above 1000 are likely to be transported, addressing high-luxury overrides for mature non-Cryo Europan operations.
4. Passengers with CryoSleep NaN (treated as non-Cryo) but all zero spending from any home planet are likely to be transported if aged under 65 and destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, correcting missing data assumptions for inactive demographic baselines.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins aged 50+ destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, overriding age negative biases in senior CryoSleep G-section cases.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-15 on G deck cabins with ShoppingMall exceeding 500 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting adolescent luxury prioritization overrides.
