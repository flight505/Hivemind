PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 67
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are likely to be transported, especially from Europa or Earth, regardless of age, overriding general low-activity biases.
2. Europa passengers in CryoSleep destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e with zero spending are likely to be transported, addressing destination-specific transport tendencies in suspended states.
3. Young passengers (aged under 25) from any home planet in CryoSleep with zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing familial transport patterns over cabin section assumptions.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-40 with moderate to high spending on FoodCourt or VRDeck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported, countering overgeneralizations in spending-outlier predictions.
5. Passengers over age 40 not in CryoSleep with high combined spending on FoodCourt and Spa are likely to be transported if from Europa, refining luxury expenditure exceptions.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with zero spending are likely to be transported unless in E or G decks, adjusting for age-destination links without strict family requirements.
7. Passengers with missing CryoSleep or Cabin data but zero spending and young age (under 20) are likely to be transported, prioritizing demographic travel assumptions.
8. Earth passengers in CryoSleep over age 50 on G decks with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing senior anomaly patterns over universal CryoSleep transport.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over age 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService but high FoodCourt spending are more likely to be transported, correcting expenditure reversal assumptions.
10. Passengers with VIP status and high FoodCourt spending are likely to be transported, regardless of other spending differentials.
