PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported, regardless of age, deck, or destination, overriding previous assumptions about deck-specific patterns.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with total Spending on RoomService, Spa, or ShoppingMall exceeding 1500 are unlikely to be transported, particularly if FoodCourt spending is low or zero.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with combined VRDeck and Spa spending exceeding 1000 and FoodCourt spending under 100 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing amenity allocation over age.
4. Elderly Earth passengers (over 50) not in CryoSleep with positive spending on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall but minimal Spa or VRDeck are more likely to be transported, reversing earlier high-spending exclusions.
5. Young adult Earth passengers (18-30) not in CryoSleep with isolated FoodCourt spending between 100-800 and no other amenities are less likely to be transported, emphasizing combined modestly distributed spending.
6. Mars passengers under 35 not in CryoSleep on E or F decks with high RoomService spending but low FoodCourt or ShoppingMall are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for intra-Mars deck variations.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep where CryoSleep is imputed or missing but Cabin on G deck are unlikely to be transported if no spending conflict, focusing on imputation risks.
