PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 65
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 5-30 on G or F decks with total spending between 100 and 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for moderate activity levels in young demographics.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless from multi-passenger family groups, refining CryoSleep assumptions for young adults.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-5 with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, differentiating infant behavior from youthful dependents.
4. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on E or F decks with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, accounting for mixed-origin luxuries influencing outcomes.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 10-40 on F deck cabins with total spending under 200 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending is minimal, supporting mid-life non-leisure patterns.
6. Passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are generally likely to be transported for ages above 40 or under 15, but exceptions apply for young adults emphasizing group dependencies.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on E or G decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, reinforcing demographic baselines.
8. Europa passengers in CryoSleep from B or C decks with all zero spending are likely to be transported regardless of age, prioritizing inactive CryoSleep elites.
9. Passengers with NaN HomePlanet not in CryoSleep aged 15-35 on E deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 50 are likely to be transported, adapting to unrecorded origins in leisure contexts.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under age 15 with PSORoomService zero and total other spending under 200 on G or F decks are likely to be transported to any destination, enhancing familial transport for low-activity youth.
11. VIP passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending over 1000 are likely to be transported, regardless of cabin, overriding general spending expectations for luxury elites.
12. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over age 65 with high Spa spending exceeding 2000 and zero RoomService on A or C decks are unlikely to be transported, refining elderly outlier reversals.
13. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are generally likely to be transported, mitigating youthful biases for passive Mars travelers.
14. Passengers with Cabin NaN or unknown sections not in CryoSleep aged 10-20 with total spending under 700 are likely to be transported to PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e, supporting displaced youth patterns.
