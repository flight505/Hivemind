PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 80
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-70 with any non-zero spending in FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, or VRDeck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for moderate expenditure overrides in middle-aged non-Cryo groups.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers with unknown cabin locations and low to medium total spending (under 3000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, addressing cabin-missing sensitivities in expenditure-variable cases.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-80 with high FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing premium food amenity trends in non-Cryo adult groups.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, mitigating over-reliance on inactivity biases for inter-solar cryo travel.
5. Non-CryoSleep Europans with high VRDeck spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, enhancing detection of entertainment-focused expenditure reversals.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 60-79 with zero or very low spending (under 1000 total) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining senior demographic transport patterns despite inactivity.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with unknown age and all zero spending on E or G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, unifying zero-activity patterns for age-ambiguous Mars youth equivalents.
8. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any HomePlanet aged under 30 with moderate RoomService spending (100-500) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, countering isolated service expenditure outliers in younger groups.
9. Europa passengers with unknown CryoSleep status but all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if VIP is false, addressing latent Cryo uncertainties in zero-activity Europan cases.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on E deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing youth-driven shopping patterns despite non-Cryo baselines.
11. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-30 on F deck cabins with SPA spending exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, highlighting relaxation-focused trends in adolescent to young adult groups.
12. Europa passengers aged 40-60 not in CryoSleep with NaN RoomService but positive aggregate spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for service-data voids in middle-aged premier groups.
13. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age under 40 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, preventing misclassification in youthful stasis non-priority cases.
14. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Mars aged 10-30 with F deck cabins and VRDeck under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, adjusting for low-tech amenity thresholds in Mars youth patterns.
15. Europa passengers with high total spending (over 3000) not in CryoSleep destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, amplifying luxury expenditure signals for privileged routes.
