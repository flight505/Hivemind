PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt, Spa, or VRDeck spending exceeding 2000 are unlikely to be transported, especially in C, D, or B cabin decks, prioritizing spending over cabin for high-value cases.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are unlikely to be transported if over 25 years old or in F deck cabins, overriding CryoSleep default for older demographics.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with low overall spending (combined under 500) and age under 25 are likely to be transported, focusing on demographic youth trends over spending homogeneity.
4. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Europa with high RoomService spending (over 1000) and age 20-40 are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing service spending patterns across planets.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with any Spa spending over 1000 are unlikely to be transported, regardless of other amenities, targeting luxury spending exceptions.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate VRDeck or ShoppingMall spending (200-1000) and destination TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if averaged across amenities, adjusting for destination preferences.
7. Passengers with CryoSleep missing (NaN) but zero spending and F deck cabins are unlikely to be transported if age over 20, treating NaN CryoSleep as partial CryoSleep for pattern consistency.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with age over 30 and destination 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, combining age and destination for elite planet exclusives.
