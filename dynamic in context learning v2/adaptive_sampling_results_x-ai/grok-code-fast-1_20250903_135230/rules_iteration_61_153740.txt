PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 61
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-30 on lower decks (F, G) with total spending under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing activity level reversals in young adult groups despite low overall spend.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 25 from upper decks (A, B, C) with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 1500 are unlikely to be transported, addressing luxury consumption outliers independent of age.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with zero total spending under age 25 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating inactivity biases in youthful demographics excluding family contexts.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 50 on E or G decks with no expenditures destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing location-specific anomalies over passive CryoSleep norms.
5. Passengers from any planet with high RoomService spending (over 500) and minimal other amenities (total non-RoomService under 50) under age 40 not in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported, highlighting service-based expenditure risks across destinations.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on F or G decks destined for 55 Cancri e with moderate total spending (200-1000) are unlikely to be transported, refining mid-life spending patterns excluding elite VIP status.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero total spending under age 30 on B or C decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, countering inactivity expectations in younger non-luxury groups.
8. Mars passengers with VIP status and ShoppingMall spending over 500 not in CryoSleep aged over 30 are unlikely to be transported, addressing status-induced biases in commercial spending patterns.
9. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet or Cabin not in CryoSleep aged 15-40 with high VRDeck and Spa combined spending (over 1000) destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating data gaps in leisure expenditure risks.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep over age 60 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, overriding age-based generalizations for elderly basal inactivity on specific routes.
