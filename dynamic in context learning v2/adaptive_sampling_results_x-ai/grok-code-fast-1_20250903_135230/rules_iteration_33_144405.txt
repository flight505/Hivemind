PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 33
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with any confirmed spending above 0 on amenities are unlikely to be transported, correcting overgeneralizations in transport likelihood for active travelers.
2. Passengers in CryoSleep aged 15-50 are more likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Earth and destination is PSO J318.5-22, mitigating age-specific CryoSleep biases outside leading age extremes.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending exceeding 3000 are likely to be transported if VIP status is True, overriding high-spending anomaly reversals for premium travelers.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-40 with combined RoomService and ShoppingMall spending above 500 are unlikely to be transported, addressing young demographic activity reversals.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 15-30 are unlikely to be transported if total spending is zero and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, refining familial dependency assumptions within mid-age groups.
6. Passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 from F or G deck cabins with VRDeck spending exceeding 500 are unlikely to be transported, independent of HomePlanet or destination outliers.
7. Passengers with NaN values in either HomePlanet or Cabin are unlikely to be transported if CryoSleep is False and total spending exceeds 200, addressing data incompleteness patterns.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over age 50 from A or B decks are unlikely to be transported regardless of high FoodCourt spending, strengthening elder demographic reversals.
9. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 are more likely to be transported only if part of multi-passenger groups, enhancing family unit deductions for youthful CryoSleep cases.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under age 25 on G deck cabins with zero spending are likely to be transported if destination is 55 Cancri e, balancing age-specific activity expectations.
