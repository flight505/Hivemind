PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 50
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth in CryoSleep with all zero spending aged under 30 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing youth-driven transport trends over general zero-activity baselines.
2. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged over 30 with all zero spending on E or F deck cabins are likely to be transported if not part of large family units, adjusting for mature demographic likelihoods in CryoSleep.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 and zero RoomService are likely to be transported upon reaching age 30, refining luxury expenditure exceptions in mid-adult groups.
4. Passengers aged under 15 from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins are likely to be transported, prioritizing familial protection priorities over activity levels.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged over 45 with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e on B or C deck cabins are likely to be transported, countering elder demographic transport tendencies regardless of deck.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-45 with total non-RoomService spending under 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, highlighting low-activity risk in adult groups.
7. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending aged under 50 on A, B, or D decks destined for any planet are likely to be transported, enforcing CryoSleep luxury correlations.
8. Passengers from any HomePlanet aged over 50 in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported unless accompanied by high spending on Spa or VRDeck, mitigating senior solitaire anomalies.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 13-29 with combined ShoppingMall and FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported if on F deck cabins, accentuating young adult leisure transport patterns.
10. Passengers with missing HomePlanet or Cabin data in CryoSleep aged under 40 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, adapting to incomplete data transport biases.
