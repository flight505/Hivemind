PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 29
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age over 50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing demographic and destination anomalies over passive CryoSleep baselines.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, overriding low activity expectations for young demographics.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt and Spa combined spending exceeding 2500 are unlikely to be transported, addressing high luxury expenditure reversals in mid-life groups regardless of other amenities.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, mitigating youthful demographic biases.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering overgeneralizations in CryoSleep transport likelihoods.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1200 are likely to be transported if total non-ShoppingMall spending remains under 100, emphasizing young adult leisure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService and VRDeck spending under 10 but FoodCourt above 2000 are unlikely to be transported, refining high-spending outlier behaviors.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing familial or dependent group transport tendencies.
9. Passengers from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with non-zero spending and age under 5 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, countering spending-based assumptions for infants and young children.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if age is over 60, reversing age-related CryoSleep biases.
11. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending under 100 and high FoodCourt spending above 3000 are likely to be transported if from B or C decks and destined for 55 Cancri e, refining luxury spending exceptions for mid-life demographics.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with total spending between 100-2000 and age between 18-50 on F deck cabins destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, mitigating spending thresholds for adult activities.
13. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with moderate spending across amenities and no zeros destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if age is between 20-60, correcting for incomplete data biases.
14. Passengers in CryoSleep from G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported regardless of age if age is between 3 and 14, addressing young child CryoSleep reversals for familial or group transports.
15. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with low RoomService but positive FoodCourt and VRDeck spending on G deck cabins are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e and age over 25, overriding baseline spending patterns for selective amenity use.
16. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with VRDeck and Spa spending exceeding combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall on C decks are likely to be transported if aged under 40 and destined for TRAPPIST-1e, refining high expenditure patterns for younger elites.
