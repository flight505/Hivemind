PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 95
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Mars with high overall spending (>500 across all amenities) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are more likely to be transported, correcting for oversight in mid-age and younger adult expenditure patterns.
2. CryoSleep passengers from Mars with all zero spending, regardless of age or cabin deck, destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported, addressing baseline cryostasis underestimation for Martian demographics.
3. CryoSleep passengers from Europa with all zero spending, regardless of age, destination, or cabin location, are more likely to be transported, refining high-priority cryostasis overrides across European age groups.
4. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa with high FoodCourt spending (>2000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are more likely to be transported, emphasizing luxury spending trends in European passenger behaviors.
5. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Mars with high ShoppingMall spending (>1000) destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are more likely to be transported, capturing leisure-focused expenditure reversals in younger and mid-age groups.
6. CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged 40-50 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are more likely to be transported, adjusting demographic thresholds for cryogenic inactivity patterns.
7. CryoSleep passengers from Earth aged under 20 with all zero spending, regardless of destination or cabin, are more likely to be transported, prioritizing youth and child cryostasis high transport likelihood.
8. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa with VIP status and moderate to high combined spending (>500 across amenities) destined for 55 Cancri e are more likely to be transported, incorporating VIP premium overrides in luxury passenger segments.
9. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 0-10 from Earth or Mars with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported, correcting for undetected family/group infant non-cryo priorities.
10. CryoSleep passengers from any planet with unknown cabin locations and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are more likely to be transported, mitigating cabin-missing variable biases in zero-activity cryogenic groups.
