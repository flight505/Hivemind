PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 32
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep destined for TRAPPIST-1e with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 and cumulative non-FoodCourt spending under 200 are likely to be transported, refining mid-range spending patterns to promote transport over zero-activity assumptions.
2. CryoSleep passengers from Earth or Mars on D, F, or G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, mitigating deck-based transport inconsistencies.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending above 200 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing outdoor spending habits for transportation despite CryoSleep absence.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-50 on F or E deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with FoodCourt spending ranging from 600 to 2500 are likely to be transported, countering generic activity thresholds.
