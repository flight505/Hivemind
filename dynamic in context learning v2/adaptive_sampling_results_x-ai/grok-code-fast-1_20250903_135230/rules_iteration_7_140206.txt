============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 800 and combined VRDeck and Spa spending under 100 are likely to be transported, even if FoodCourt spending is low.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2800 are likely to be transported, regardless of other amenity spending or age.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with age between 45 and 55 and ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, prioritizing high amenity usage.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) exceeding 800 and age over 40 are likely to be transported on F or G decks.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with VRDeck spending exceeding 300 and Spa spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, focusing on upper amenity balance.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with age under 30 and VRDeck spending exceeding 2000 after high FoodCourt spending are likely to be transported.
7. Passengers in CryoSleep with Earth home planet and age under 25 headed to PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, even if all spending is zero.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService under 200 and ShoppingMall exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, especially on F deck.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending under 50 and age between 20 and 30 are unlikely to be transported on G deck if RoomService exceeds 100.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate VRDeck spending (100-500) and very low Spa spending are unlikely to be transported if FoodCourt is over 3000.
