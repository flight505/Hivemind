PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 52
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged over 40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported than previously assumed, overriding broad "unlikely" baselines for older demographics unless they exceed age 60 or have VIP status.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 regardless of combined spending thresholds are likely to be transported, prioritizing high FoodCourt expenditure patterns for mid-adult age groups.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-40 from F deck cabins with total spending between 200-3000 across amenities are likely to be transported if not destined for restricted planets like 55 Cancri e, reversing underpredictions for moderate activity levels in working-age demographics.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 30 from F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 are likely to be transported, mitigating age-based biases in spending patterns and emphasizing ShoppingMall focus for family-oriented groups.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 25 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are less likely to be transported than younger siblings in CryoSleep, introducing conditional age adjustments within familial unit patterns.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 from C deck cabins with VRDeck spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, countering low-activity assumptions for elderly high-tech spenders regardless of other low expenditures.
