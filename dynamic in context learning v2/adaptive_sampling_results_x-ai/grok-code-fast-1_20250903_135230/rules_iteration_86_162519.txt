PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 86
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Europan passengers under age 30 on any deck with zero spending destined for any planet are likely to be transported, overriding inactivity assumptions for youth-adjacent Europan mobility patterns.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers under age 20 on G deck cabins with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting pediatric transport rates for non-Cryo children regardless of cabin efficiency.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 17-25 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending between 500-1500 and other amenities under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing moderate food-focused activity in adolescent cruising behaviors.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers under age 10 on G deck cabins in Cryo-like zero-spending scenarios but non-Cryo destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining infant transport logic to account for non-Cryo status.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 30-40 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, emphasizing mid-adult food expenditure drivers in destination-specific routing.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 8-15 on G deck cabins with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, extending child-focused zero-activity patterns beyond Cryo expectations.
7. Non-CryoSleep Martian passengers aged 20-40 on E or F decks with RoomService under 400 and ShoppingMall exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, highlighting Martian service preference reversals for middle-aged groups.
8. Non-CryoSleep Martian passengers aged 20-25 on F decks with moderate RoomService and ShoppingMall spending but zero Spa/VRDeck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for youthful Martian amenity avoidance trends.
9. Non-CryoSleep Europan passengers aged 40-50 with VIP status on unknown cabins and high Spa/VRDeck spending over 4000 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, addressing luxury amenity overload in wealthy Europan bypass scenarios.
