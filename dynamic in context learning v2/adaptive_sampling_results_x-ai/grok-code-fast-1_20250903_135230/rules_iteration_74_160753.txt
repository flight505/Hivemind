PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 74
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 10 with all zero spending destined for any planet are unlikely to be transported, correcting for child-specific CryoSleep overruns in zero-activity groups.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000, regardless of other amenities or deck, are likely to be transported, emphasizing luxury dining patterns in Europa non-Cryo demographics.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with high ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing Martian leisure expenditure trends in middle-aged non-Cryo groups.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-25 with all zero RoomService spending but any positive spending on other amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, refining youth activity thresholds excluding service extras.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 20 with all zero spending on active amenities are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo baselines for child and young adult high-priority patterns.
6. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 30-45 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing adult CryoSleep stability in low-expenditure point-origin travelers.
7. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any planet with VIP status True and total spending exceeding 2500, particularly on FoodCourt or Spa, are likely to be transported if destined for 55 Cancri e, integrating VIP premium behavior overrides.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50-70 with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 but low RoomService are likely to be transported destined for TRAPPIST-1e, enhancing senior retail activity patterns in non-Cryo groups.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, strengthening Martian mid-age spending escalation trends.
10. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers with unknown or high Spa or VRDeck spending, irrespective of total sum but in A or B deck cabins, are likely to be transported if VIP status is False, correcting for cabin-specific amenity equilibration in Europa non-Cryo trends.
