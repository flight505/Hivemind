PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 82
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers with CryoSleep status unknown aged 18-35 on G or E deck cabins with FoodCourt or ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, adapting youth activity thresholds for missing CryoSleep data.
2. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 40-60 on D or F deck cabins with any amenity spending exceeding 400 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending spending-driven overrides for Martian middle-aged groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 on B or D deck cabins with total spending exceeding 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing Europan high-expenditure activity patterns.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50-60 on F deck cabins with VRDeck spending exceeding 700 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining senior leisure indicators.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 40-70 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting over-reliance on Cryo zero-activity for adult Martians.
6. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 10 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for any location are unlikely to be transported, addressing Cryo child exception patterns.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on any deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing zero-activity youth overrides.
8. Earth passengers with CryoSleep status unknown aged 25-40 on E deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 800 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, handling missing Cryo indicators for shopping-centric groups.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on any deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 800 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, focusing on young Europan food expenditure trends.
10. Mars passengers with CryoSleep status unknown aged 10-30 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending adult adolescent inactivity patterns for Mars.
