PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 94
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, regardless of homeplanet, age, or destination, addressing the general pattern of cryo inactivity correlating with transport priority in sedentary groups.
2. Europa and Mars passengers aged 18-45 in CryoSleep with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining planetary transport overrides for middle-aged cryo-dominant demographics.
3. Earth passengers under age 30 in CryoSleep with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering underestimation for younger terrestrial cryo-sleepers in zero-activity scenarios.
4. Non-CryoSleep passengers with unknown homeplanet in CryoSleep aged 60+ with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending zero-expenditure patterns for unidentified cryo-elderly groups.
5. Mars passengers aged 10-35 in CryoSleep with zero spending on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing Martian cryo-transport likelihood for adolescent-to-adult zero-spenders.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers on G or F decks aged 20-30 with total spending under 500 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if non-cryo sleepers have prioritized spending in low-cost amenities like ShoppingMall or Spa.
7. Earth passengers aged 0-15 in CryoSleep or non-Cryo with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, targeting child demographic high-priority transport regardless of sleep status in low-engagement groups.
8. Passengers aged 15-35 on E or G decks with unknown CryoSleep status and zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, handling missing data in young adult cabin-specific zero-engagement patterns across planets.
9. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged 25-50 with zero spending on B or C decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing europan cryo-transport trends in middle-adult high-deck groups.
10. Earth passengers aged 18-40 with False CryoSleep and ShoppingMall spending over 500 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported on G decks, mitigating underprediction for leisure-focused non-cryo terrestrials in destination-specific patterns.
11. Mars passengers aged 18-25 with False CryoSleep and total spending over 200 on RoomService or ShoppingMall destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported on F or E decks, addressing low-activity marsian overrides in spending-outlier patterns.
12. Passengers on G deck cabins aged under 5 in CryoSleep with zero spending destined for any location are likely to be transported, generalizing infant cryo-transport priority across all planets and destinations.
