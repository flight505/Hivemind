PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 47
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age over 50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing demographic and destination anomalies over passive CryoSleep baselines, except for select subgroups where familial ties indicator NaN in group size.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e, overriding low activity expectations for young demographics.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with FoodCourt and Spa combined spending exceeding 3500 are still likely to be transported, adjusting for high-end luxury outliers in mature age groups regardless of exact combined amount.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, mitigating youthful demographic biases.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported if age exceeds 25, refining overgeneralizations in CryoSleep transport likelihoods for mid-young adults.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1200 are likely to be transported if total non-ShoppingMall spending remains under 100, emphasizing young adult leisure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService and VRDeck spending under 10 but FoodCourt above 1500 are likely to be transported, expanding outlier behaviors for mid-life luxury prioritizers.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing familial or dependent group transport tendencies.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on A or E deck cabins with all zero spending and age under 40 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing missed transport patterns for young low-activity Europans across select destinations.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-55 on F or E deck cabins with moderate FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, countering underestimation of mid-life social spending trends.
11. Passengers with missing HomePlanet data in CryoSleep on G deck cabins aged over 50 with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, incorporating anomaly detection for incomplete demographic profiles.
12. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 45-60 on G deck cabins with zero RoomService, Spa, and VRDeck spending but varying FoodCourt destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if age exceeds 45, refining elderly dependent patterns with flexible food consumption.
