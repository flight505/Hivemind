PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 9
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with significant FoodCourt spending (over 500) or combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1500 are likely to be transported, overriding previous moderate spending rules.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G or F decks with age over 40 or undisclosed age and zero spending across amenities are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing age and ship section over CryoSleep assumptions.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with high FoodCourt spending (over 3000) and some VRDeck or Spa spending (even under 2500 combined) are likely to be transported, regardless of age or deck, emphasizing elite spending patterns.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under 50 with significant ShoppingMall or FoodCourt spending (over 600) are likely to be transported, expanding beyond FoodCourt focus to include luxury trends.
5. Elderly passengers (over 50) from any planet not in CryoSleep with low to moderate spending primarily in non-luxury amenities (RoomService, ShoppingMall, FoodCourt under 2000 total) but some Spa or VRDeck are more likely to be transported if on E deck or above, countering default unlikelihood assumptions.
6. Young passengers (under 25) from Earth not in CryoSleep with limited RoomService spending (under 200) but positive FoodCourt or VRDeck are likely to be transported, focusing on developmental spending.
7. CryoSleep passengers from Mars or Europa with zero spending and age under 30 on D or E decks are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for destination and familial logistics.
