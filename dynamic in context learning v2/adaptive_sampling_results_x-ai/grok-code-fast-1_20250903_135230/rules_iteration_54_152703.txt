PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 54
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Young passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and age under 25 across HomePlanets are likely to be transported, prioritizing youthful demographic patterns and CryoSleep status over deck or destination variations.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from higher decks (A, B, C) with high FoodCourt or ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 and age over 18 are likely to be transported, refining luxury expenditure behaviors beyond standard low-activity baselines.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 with all zero spending are likely to be transported if part of family groups or on non-E/G decks, mitigating familial ties against early-age biases.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on B decks with VIP status and combined luxury spending (FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa) over 2000 are likely to be transported, addressing VIP and high-spending reversals.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on G decks with partial spending (RoomService or VRDeck above 100) are unlikely to be transported, countering expenditure outliers in young active demographics.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under age 15 on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e with zero spending are unlikely to be transported despite youthful patterns, emphasizing destination-specific exceptions.
7. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 50+ with all zero spending on D or E decks are likely to be transported, expanding CryoSleep likelihoods across senior demographics.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over age 30 on D decks with FoodCourt spending above 1000 are likely to be transported, adjusting for mid-life spending trends.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with high ShoppingMall spending above 1000 on F decks are likely to be transported, reinforcing leisure-oriented transport signals.
10. CryoSleep passengers across HomePlanets with unknown or NaN cabins and all zero spending are likely to be transported, handling missing data patterns in CryoSleep contexts.
