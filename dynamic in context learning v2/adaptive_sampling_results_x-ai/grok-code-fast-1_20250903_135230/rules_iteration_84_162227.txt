PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 84
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending across amenities are likely to be transported, overriding specific deck or age-based biases for all homeplanets destined for any location.
2. Non-CryoSleep passengers aged 0-10 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, prioritizing child protection priorities across all homeplanets and cabins.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on G or E decks with RoomService exceeding 50 and other spending under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining moderate service usage against transport likelihood.
4. Europa passengers aged 20-40 in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, extending luxury-origin patterns beyond specific decks.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep on F, D, or E decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting deck-specific variances for resource-conserving groups.
6. Non-CryoSleep passengers of any homeplanet aged 10-20 with combined ShoppingMall and VRDeck spending exceeding 500 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, addressing entertainment-driven risks.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50-70 on G decks with VRDeck spending exceeding 800 and other amenities under 50 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating isolated leisure oversights.
8. Passengers with unknown cabin locations in CryoSleep, aged 25-45, with all zero spending destined for any location are likely to be transported if from non-Earth homeplanets, extending cabin-missing corrections to broader demographics.
