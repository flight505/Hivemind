PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 66
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported if age is under 50, regardless of HomePlanet or destination, overriding passive CryoSleep baselines for adults.
2. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged 15-40 with all zero spending from B or C decks destined for 55 Cancri e or NaN are likely to be transported, prioritizing luxury planet demographic anomalies.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 30 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, unless in E or G decks for family units, addressing youthful exploration biases.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 20 or over 40 with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, countering age-based overgeneralizations in short-haul destinations.
5. Passengers not in CryoSleep with low to moderate spending (total under 1000) aged 20-50 from F or E decks destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if FoodCourt or ShoppingMall is positive, emphasizing activity-driven transport for mid-age groups.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under age 15 or over 45 with all zero spending on G decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, reinforcing dependent demographic transport tendencies.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt or Spa spending exceeding 1500 on C or D decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if age is over 30, refining high-expenditure patterns for older elites.
8. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported if age is over 20, mitigating Martian efficiency biases in cryo selection.
9. Passengers with HomePlanet NaN in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing unknown origin corrections.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 15 with all zero spending on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing familial safety overrides for young dependents.
11. Passengers in CryoSleep with NaN in CryoSleep field but all zero spending are likely to be transported if from Europa or Mars, assuming cryopreservation for non-Earth origins.
12. Passengers not in CryoSleep with combined RoomService and VRDeck under 10 but FoodCourt over 1000 from A or B decks are unlikely to be transported if VIP False and age over 35, emphasizing luxury discrepancies.  
13. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under age 5 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, countering very young demographic transport patterns.
14. Europa passengers in CryoSleep from B decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if age is under 40, refining cryo selection for high-status cabins.  
15. Earth passengers in CryoSleep over age 50 with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for elder evacuation priorities on shorter routes.
16. Passengers with VIP True not in CryoSleep with moderate spending (under 2000) are unlikely to be transported, addressing VIP retention for luxury services.
17. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-50 with all zero spending destined for any destination are likely to be transported, generalizing Martian cryo efficiency patterns.
18. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService but high Spa/FoodCourt (over 2000 combined) aged over 40 are unlikely to be transported, refining habituation risks for veterans.
19. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with all zero spending but positive VRDeck on lower decks (E-G) are likely to be transported if destination is 55 Cancri e, enhancing virtual leisure transport boosts.  
20. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending from F decks are likely to be transported if HomePlanet is Mars or Europa, prioritizing mid-ship cryo corridors for multi-planet families.
21. Non-CryoSleep passengers with NaN in spending fields and low reported spending are unlikely to be transported if from Earth on G decks to TRAPPIST-1e, handling data incompleteness penalties.
22. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged under 25 with all zero spending destined for NaN are likely to be transported, adjusting for unknown destination risk transfers.
23. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 10 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported if on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e, reinforcing child safety protocols.
24. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under age 20 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, countering low-spend youth migration trends.
25. Passengers with destination NaN in CryoSleep with all zero spending are likely to be transported if from Europa on C decks, assuming high-priority cryo for uncertain paths.
