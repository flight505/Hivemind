PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 41
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, irrespective of age or deck, to prioritize destination-specific underspending anomalies.
2. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with no spending are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, overriding passive CryoSleep baselines for higher-status group behaviors unless accompanied by extreme rental spending.
3. Passengers in CryoSleep with missing HomePlanet and all zero spending are likely to be transported, highlighting anonymous profiles' increased transport odds across destinations.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with very high FoodCourt spending (>4000) and non-zero Spa or VRDeck are more likely to be transported than predicted, adjusting for luxury expenditure exceptions in affluent demographics.
5. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 30+ with all zero spending on F deck cabins are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e, countering age-based overgeneralizations for mid-life familial ties.
6. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported despite zero spending, refining underestimation for dependent group dynamics in this range.
7. Passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate shopping spending (500-1000) over 20 on F or G decks heading to non-TRAPPIST destinations are likely to be transported, emphasizing low-risk leisure patterns.
8. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with missing or zero Spa and VRDeck spending are likely to be transported for 55 Cancri e destinations, mitigating incomplete data biases in high-value groups.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under age 10 with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing youthful dependency trends against baseline inactivity.
10. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with FoodCourt as NaN and other zero spending are likely to be transported for TRAPPIST-1e, adjusting for data sparsity in privileged demographic transport odds.
11. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with some RoomService spending (>500) and minimal other amenities on F decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported, overriding general low-spending false negatives.
12. Passengers in CryoSleep with missing HomePlanet and all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, reinforcing anonymous profile patterns for selective transport.
13. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged under 40 on B or A decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported despite all zero spending, refining high-status group expectations.
14. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with ShoppingMall as primary spending (>700) destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering overemphasis on CryoSleep in moderation patterns.
15. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 10-18 on G decks with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing familial dependency for youth in economy sections.
16. Europa passengers in CryoSleep over age 50 with all zero spending on C or E decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for retirement-era affluent group priorities.
17. Passengers not in CryoSleep with missing Spa spending and zero other amenities on G or E decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported for Earth or Mars origins, mitigating data incompletion in middle-class exceptions.
