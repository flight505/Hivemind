PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 26
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero spending and ages under 40 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, overriding general CryoSleep transport baselines for younger middle-class demographics.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 17-45 on G or F deck cabins with zero RoomService but positive spending exceeding 200 on ShoppingMall alone (or combined with minimal FoodCourt) are likely to be transported if destination is TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, correcting low-activity assumptions for mid-life groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-50 from C or A deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 (regardless of Spa or VRDeck) are likely to be transported if VIP status is True or False but excluding children, refining luxury reversal patterns.
4. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 25 on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless part of multi-passenger family units, mitigating youthful demographic biases.
5. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 40 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, countering overgeneralizations in CryoSleep transport likelihoods.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1200 are likely to be transported if total non-ShoppingMall spending remains under 100, emphasizing young adult leisure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 35 from A or C decks with zero RoomService and VRDeck spending under 10 but FoodCourt above 2000 are unlikely to be transported, refining high-spending outlier behaviors.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing familial or dependent group transport tendencies.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 8-65 on B, C, or A decks with all zero spending are likely to be transported regardless of destination, exceptions for child demographics with minimal amenities usage.
10. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 35-55 from C deck cabins with Spa or VRDeck spending exceeding 600 (with potential NaN in FoodCourt) are likely to be transported if RoomService is zero, addressing incomplete spending data reversal trends.
