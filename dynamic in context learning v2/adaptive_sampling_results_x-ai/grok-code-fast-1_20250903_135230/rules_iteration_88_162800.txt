PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 88
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers aged 0-15 who are not in CryoSleep and have zero spending across all amenities are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo expectations for youthful demographics with minimal activity.
2. Europa passengers aged 20-40 not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, emphasizing high amenity utilization patterns in this age group regardless of deck location.
3. Mars passengers aged 20-35 not in CryoSleep with total spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, highlighting spending-dependent transport trends in middle-aged Mars demographics on F or E decks.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending between 100 and 1000 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are more likely to not be transported, refining youth expenditure thresholds in non-TRAPPIST destinations.
5. Earth CryoSleep passengers aged 18-30 with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, correcting overconfidence in Cryo status for young adults in this destination.
6. Earth CryoSleep passengers aged 20-40 with zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, extending destination-specific caveats for Cryo low-activity cases.
7. Earth non-CryoSleep passengers aged 40-50 with moderate spending (total under 2000) on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to not be transported, addressing middle-aged inactivity biases in non-Cryo scenarios.
8. Europa non-CryoSleep passengers with unknown cabin on any deck destined for 55 Cancri e with moderate spending (FoodCourt between 200-1000) are likely to be transported, incorporating cabin-missing variables in spending-focused patterns.
9. Earth non-CryoSleep passengers aged 50-65 on F or G deck cabins with Spa or VRDeck spending exceeding 500 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, updating senior leisure priorities for non-Cryo groups.
10. Mars non-CryoSleep infants (aged 0-5) with zero spending on any deck are likely to be transported, ensuring high-priority overrides for triplicate non-Cryo baselines in this demographic.
