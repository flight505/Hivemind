PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total luxury spending (sum of FoodCourt, Spa, and VRDeck) exceeding 4000 are unlikely to be transported, regardless of age or cabin deck.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending over 500 or total amenity spending (excluding FoodCourt) exceeding 1000 are highly unlikely to be transported, focusing on spending prioritization.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending are likely to be transported only if age is between 10 and 60; very young (under 10) or elderly (over 60) Earth CryoSleep passengers are unlikely to be transported despite zero spending.
4. Young Earth passengers (18-30) not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and VRDeck spending over 500 are more likely to be transported, adjusting for spending distribution beyond shopping amenities.
5. Passengers from any HomePlanet not in CryoSleep with significant RoomService spending (over 1000) coupled with high ShoppingMall spending (over 500) are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing service and retail patterns.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep, aged 20-40, with high Spa spending (over 1000) combined with any non-zero RoomService are unlikely to be transported, targeting mid-age luxury excess.
7. Mars passengers under 25 not in CryoSleep, in F deck cabins, are likely to be transported primarily if FoodCourt spending is over 1000 and other spending is minimal, refining age and location trends.
8. Passengers with CryoSleep status as NaN and zero spending across amenities are less likely to be transported if from Earth or Mars, assuming active engagement detracts from transport.
9. Elderly passengers from Europa (over 50) not in CryoSleep, with any spending in RoomService over 50 combined with Destination to 55 Cancri e, are more likely to be transported despite spending.
10. VIP status on Mars does not override high RoomService spending; Mars VIP passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService over 300 are unlikely to be transported, prioritizing spending behavior.
