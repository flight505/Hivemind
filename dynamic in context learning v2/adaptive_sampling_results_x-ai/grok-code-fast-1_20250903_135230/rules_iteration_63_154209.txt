PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 63
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 with combined Spa and VRDeck spending exceeding 500 are likely to be transported, addressing unexpected spending patterns in older demographics regardless of deck or destination.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with VIP status and all zero spending are likely to be transported, overriding low-activity biases for VIP-enabled individuals across all destinations.
3. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with no spending across amenities are likely to be transported, prioritizing CryoSleep stability over traditional demographic or destination factors.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 10 with zero spending on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining family-group dependencies in very young CryoSleep groups.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from B or D decks with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported if combined spending with Spa and VRDeck is over 500, correcting for high-luxury anomalies in B/D mid-range cabins.
6. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 20-40 with zero spending on F decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adapting CryoSleep patterns to include mid-age adult groups regardless of deck specifics.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with zero spending on E decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing young adult group transport tendencies on lower decks.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 30 with RoomService and VRDeck zero, but ShoppingMall exceeding 2000, are likely to be transported if from A or B decks, addressing atypical shopping-focused spending reversals.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 20 with all amenities zero except FoodCourt under 10 are likely to be transported, mitigating baseline activity assumptions for teenagers and children.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep destined for PSO J318.5-22 regardless of age or G deck if spending is zero are likely to be transported, emphasizing destination-specific CryoSleep boosts over low-spend defaults.
11. Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged over 50 with zero spending are likely to be transported, correcting for mid-life CryoSleep exceptions in luxury cabins.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 with high ShoppingMall spending over 2000 and other amenities under 100 are unlikely to be transported, highlighting spending concentration risks.
13. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 50-70 from F decks with some spending on Spa or VRDeck are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e, adjusting for life-stage activity outliers.
14. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 25 from C decks with combined FoodCourt and ShoppingMall over 1000 are likely to be transported, refining young adult spending patterns in premium sections.
15. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with family groups aged under 30 are likely to be transported even at zero spending, emphasizing multi-passenger CryoSleep dependencies.
