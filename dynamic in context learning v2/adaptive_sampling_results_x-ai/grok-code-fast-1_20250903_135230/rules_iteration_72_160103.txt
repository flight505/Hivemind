PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 72
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 21-39 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining age thresholds for demographic transport risks in under-40 CryoSleep groups.
2. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on G deck cabins with total spending under 1000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing moderate spending patterns that override inactivity biases in middle-aged groups.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 500 destined for PSO J318.5-22 or TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing youth-focused food expenditure trends despite non-Cryo status.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers with unknown cabin locations and all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e, particularly aged 35-45, are likely to be transported if no high-transaction amenities are involved, correcting for cabin-missing variables in zero-activity cases.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-25 on F deck cabins with RoomService exceeding 2000 but other amenities under 100 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, mitigating isolated high-service outliers for younger demographics.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 20-30 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing concentrated food spending in young adult patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-5 from any deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo baselines for infant and toddler high-priority groups.
8. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 50-70 on F deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 1000 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, highlighting senior leisure-focused expenditure reversals.
9. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-15 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt spending under 2000 and VRDeck under 10 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining adolescent activity thresholds.
10. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers with unknown age on E or G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending zero-expenditure patterns for Marseille non-Cryo youth-equivalent groups.
11. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 60+ on any deck cabins with ShoppingMall spending over 1000 destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, extending senior spending overlays for elder high-spend Cryo groups.
12. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on C deck cabins with FoodCourt spending exceeding 5000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, prioritizing luxury amenity patterns in adult Europan demographics.
13. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet aged 40-50 on G deck cabins with total spending between 500-1000 destined for any location are likely to be transported, adjusting for demographic spending thresholds in unknown-origin groups.
14. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 0-5 on G deck cabins with any zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, refining pediatric CryoSleep risks in infancy-toddler categories.
15. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-25 on G deck cabins with moderate spending spread across amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, addressing youth multi-service expenditure trends.
16. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with unknown cabin aged 25-40 with high Spa and VRDeck spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, emphasizing Europan recreation service preferences.
17. Passengers aged 40-60 from any HomePlanet on E deck cabins with zero spending but not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo inactivity for mid-life E-deck scenarios.
18. Earth passengers aged 30-40 not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with FoodCourt and Spa spending targeted for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing dispersed amenity transport patterns in adult Earth groups.
19. Passengers with unknown Destination aged 30-50 on G deck cabins with combined FoodCourt and RoomService exceeding 800 destined for any location are likely to be transported, adjusting for destination-uncertainty in high-amenity scenarios.
20. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-25 on E or G decks with zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending Mars Cryo youth transportibilities.
21. Earth passengers aged 1-5 not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, refining non-Cryo infant patterns for non-TRAPPIST destinations.
22. Europa passengers aged 20-30 in CryoSleep on any deck with high Spa spending destined for 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, mitigating luxury Cryo anomalies in young Europan groups.
