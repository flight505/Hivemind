PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 58
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G or F deck cabins with non-zero moderate spending across amenities, aged 20-50, and destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, correcting overgeneralizations for active middle-aged demographics with spending in diverse destinations.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with combined spending exceeding 300 and non-zero room or shopping expenses are likely to be transported, adjusting for youthful active patterns regardless of exact spending distribution.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A or C deck cabins with total luxury spending (FoodCourt, Spa, VRDeck) exceeding 2000 and aged over 40 are likely to be transported, refining high-elite expenditure tendencies among older demographics.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 10 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, countering assumptions for very young passive states in common Earth groupings.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from B or C deck cabins aged 30-50 with zero RoomService and high FoodCourt or Spa spending over 1000 are likely to be transported, addressing mid-life luxury behaviors across cabin sections.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-50 on D deck cabins with moderate RoomService or total spending under 1000 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, mitigating demographic biases for mature Mars travelers with low-key activity.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 on F deck cabins with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, emphasizing economic destination alignments for seniors.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on A deck cabins aged under 50 with total VRDeck and Spa spending over 500 are unlikely to be transported despite high luxury, focusing on anomaly reversals in mid-range elite habits.
9. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 35 on E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless VIP, supporting youth-centric CryoSleep exceptions for Mars demographics.
10. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 on F deck cabins with FoodCourt over 300 and total amenities under 1000 are likely to be transported, refining active adult patterns with controlled leisure spending.
11. Europa passengers in CryoSleep over age 60 from B deck cabins with zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, adjusting for senior CryoSleep priorities in premier cabin sections.
12. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 15-25 on E deck cabins with ShoppingMall over 200 and zero other amenities are likely to be transported, highlighting young leisure-focused behaviors.
