PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total luxury spending (FoodCourt + Spa + VRDeck) exceeding 5000 and destination TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported, overriding high baseline transport expectations for luxury preferences.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 25 destined for PSO J318.5-22 are unlikely to be transported, mitigating passivity assumptions in younger demographics with long-haul destinations.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending over 1000 but total non-luxury spending under 200 are likely to be transported, emphasizing leisure-focused youth patterns over general expenditure biases.
4. Passengers not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending over 1000 across any planet are unlikely to be transported, addressing health or comfort-related transport avoidance regardless of other factors.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 from A, B, or C decks with VRDeck spending over 3000 are unlikely to be transported, refining entertainment excess patterns beyond amenity use thresholds.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G or F decks with all amenities zero and destination 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported if aged 20-45, countering budget traveler transport generalizations.
7. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under 25 on E or F decks with all zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported unless in single occupancy cabins, balancing youth efficiency with isolation risks.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over 35 from C deck with zero RoomService and Spa under 100 but FoodCourt over 2500 are likely to be transported if total spending is under 3000, optimizing dietary indulgence transport probabilities.
9. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep under 40 with mixed low spending (under 500 total) on G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for dependency or external factors in young groups.
10. Passengers not in CryoSleep with high combined Spa and VRDeck spending (over 4000) and destination 55 Cancri e are unlikely to be transported across all planets, prioritizing discretionary expenditure as a negative transport indicator.
