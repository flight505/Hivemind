PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 92
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with total spending exceeding 1000 destined for any location are unlikely to be transported, overriding spending-positive biases that do not align with non-Cryo statuses in Europa groups.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with any positive spending on amenities are unlikely to be transported, correcting for misassociations between activity and transport in non-Cryo Mars demographics.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and aged 20-40 on F or G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining false positive rates in younger CryoSleep cohorts with no activity.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate total spending (100-2000) on non-FoodCourt amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, addressing over-prediction for varied spending patterns outside of food-centric behavior.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with high spending on Spa or VRDeck (exceeding 500 each) on F or G decks regardless of destination are unlikely to be transported, mitigating leisure-focused outlier predictions in mid-Age groups not attuned to Cryo baselines.
6. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any HomePlanet aged 30-50 with mixed amenity spending (not all zero) on E deck cabins are unlikely to be transported, refining transport risks for middle-aged non-Cryo activity clusters.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 with positive but low spending (under 500 total) destined for non-TRAPPIST-1e locations are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for under-correction in older non-Cryo spending tendencies.
8. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending aged 20-30 on E deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, extending caution to zero-activity Cryo subgroups that deviate from typical Europa patterns.
9. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending and unknown or missing minor amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if aged under 30, prioritizing youth Cryo alignment despite Mars variations.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending aged 35-50 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing Cryo zero-spend positives for mid-age Earth cohorts.
