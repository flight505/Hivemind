PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 59
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth or Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-50 on E, F, or G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with total spending exceeding 200 across amenities like FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, or VRDeck are likely to be transported, prioritizing moderate spending patterns over low-activity assumptions.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 15 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, overriding passive CryoSleep transport tendencies for adolescents and children.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-40 on D or F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with ShoppingMall spending over 2000 and minimal other amenities are likely to be transported if RoomService is under 200, emphasizing leisure-focused spending in younger demographics.
4. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 from A deck cabins destined for 55 Cancri e with combined Spa and VRDeck spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported, refining luxury amenity prioritization for mid-adult groups.
5. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 40-60 on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with FoodCourt spending over 500 and total spending under 1000 are likely to be transported, adjusting for adult dietary indulgence patterns against baseline non-transport expectations.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 on F deck cabins destined for 55 Cancri e with mixed spending across RoomService, FoodCourt, and Spa each under 700 but totaling over 1000 are likely to be transported, mitigating overcautious transport predictions for diverse expenditure profiles.
