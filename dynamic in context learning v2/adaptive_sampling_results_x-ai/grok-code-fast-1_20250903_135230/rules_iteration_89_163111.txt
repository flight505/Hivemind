PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 89
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 13-30 with any non-zero spending in FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, or VRDeck destined for any colony are likely to be transported, addressing underestimation of low-to-moderate activity in younger demographics across deck types and destinations.
2. Non-CryoSleep Mars passengers aged 20-40 with total spending exceeding 500 across all amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting biases against moderate spending patterns in Martian middle-aged groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-45 on B or C decks with FoodCourt or Spa spending exceeding 2000 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining high-amenity expenditure thresholds for European mid-life non-active groups.
4. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet not in CryoSleep on B, C, or E decks with all-zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e aged 30-40 are unlikely to be transported if VRDeck or Spa are zero, mitigating cabin-location overrides in zero-activity unknown-planet cases.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 40-50 on E, F, or G decks with RoomService or ShoppingMall exceeding 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, prioritizing service-based spending in middle-aged terrestrial patterns.
6. CryoSleep passengers aged 15-25 from Earth or Mars on G deck with all-zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported only if VIP is False and age is below 20, adjusting for youth Cryo exceptions in G-deck zero-spend scenarios.
7. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 10-20 on F, G, or E decks with FoodCourt exceeding 800 or ShoppingMall exceeding 100 destined for PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, enhancing food and leisure trends for adolescent non-CryoSleep groups regardless of deck.
8. Passengers from any planet not in CryoSleep with unknown age on G deck and minimal spending (under 100 total) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting age-unknown assumptions in low-activity patterns.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-10 on any deck with all-zero spending are likely to be transported regardless of destination, prioritizing safety overrides for very young European inactive infants.
10. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 35-50 with VRDeck exceeding 500 on C or D decks destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing Deck C leisure spending in older terrestrial demographics.
