PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with any non-zero spending across RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, or VRDeck are likely to be transported, particularly if spending exceeds 500 total and age is between 14 and 25.
2. Europa passengers over 40 not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 200 are likely to be transported, overriding other spending patterns.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with age under 45 and destination TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported unless VIP status is true.
4. Earth passengers over 50 not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall or FamilyService spending exceeding 100 are likely to be transported despite age, focusing on moderate amenity usage.
5. Young Earth passengers (under 5) not in CryoSleep are likely to be transported even with zero spending, prioritizing age demographic trends.
6. Europa passengers with VIP status and any non-zero spending in deluxe amenities (FoodCourt or Spa over 100) are likely to be transported regardless of CryoSleep status.
7. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on B or C deck are likely to be transported if age is over 50 and spending is zero across all amenities.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep under 25 with primary spending in FoodCourt exceeding 1000 are unlikely to be transported, correcting over-optimistic predictions for low-age spender subgroups.
9. Europa passengers over 50 not in CryoSleep with RoomService or VRDeck spending over 500 are likely to be transported, prioritizing high-value amenity utilization.
10. Earth passengers on G or F deck not in CryoSleep aged 16-25 with destination other than TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if any spending exceeds 200.
