PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 46
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Children under 15 from Europa or Earth not in CryoSleep with zero or minimal spending on amenities other than FoodCourt, regardless of cabin deck or half, are likely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, prioritizing vulnerable young demographics for relocation over low activity baselines.
2. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 30-55 with high ShoppingMall spending over 800 are likely to be transported, emphasizing mature individual leisure patterns that often prioritize personal stowing in working-class groups.
3. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from C or A deck cabins with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 2000 are likely to be transported if aged over 20, altering high luxury expenditure trends by focusing on middle-tier elites who secure transport despite elevated indulgences.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-60 with moderate combined RoomService and FoodCourt spending between 500-2000, alongside any Spa or VRDeck under 50, are likely to be transported if not VIP, adjusting for familial breadwinner responsibilities in non-luxury cabins.
5. Passengers with unknown CryoSleep status from F, D, or E deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if aged 20-50, regardless of planet, mitigating overgeneralizations in missing data by assuming active override for mid-life travelers.
6. Europa or Earth passengers in CryoSleep with all zero spending aged under 40 on G or C decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, countering age-based anomalies for resource-efficient cryogenic storage in common ports.
7. Mars or Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from B or E decks with FoodCourt under 100 but combined Spa and VRDeck exceeding 500 are likely to be transported if aged 30-45, refining immersive leisure outlier behaviors that correlate with transport success in frontier expenditurists.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 50 on G decks with zero Spending in RoomService and all non-essential amenities, destined for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e, are likely to be transported, enhancing generational relocation priorities in elderly dependents.
9. Passengers with cabin decks C, D, or A and unknown or false VIP status, across all planets, are likely to be transported if not in CryoSleep and have minimal overall spending under 500 total, downsizing high-deck stereotypes for economy travelers securing slots.
10. Europa passengers under 25 not in CryoSleep with zero RoomService but FoodCourt over 3000 are unlikely to be transported, preserving youth-driven anomaly reversals in elite spending with destination to TRAPPIST-1e, refining overoptimistic predictions.
