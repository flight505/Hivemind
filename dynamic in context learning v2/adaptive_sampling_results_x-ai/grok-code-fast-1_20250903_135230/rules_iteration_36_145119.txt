PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 36
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers with CryoSleep True on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported if aged over 40, prioritizing demographic anomalies in older age groups regardless of destination.
2. Earth passengers with CryoSleep True on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported if aged under 15, adjusting for age-specific behaviors in very young groups overriding general CryoSleep trends.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on any deck cabins with non-zero spending in at least one amenity destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, expanding familial tendencies in young adults across spending patterns.
4. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged over 30 on E deck cabins with non-zero spending in multiple amenities destined for PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, emphasizing leisure-oriented behaviors in mid-life demographics.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A deck cabins with VIP status and non-zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining higher-status outcomes in luxury spending clusters.
6. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 from C deck cabins with non-zero spending destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, addressing spending patterns in mid-age groups for shorter destinations.
7. Passengers with CryoSleep NaN and non-zero spending across any amenities are treated as not in CryoSleep and assessed based on age, spending, and destination patterns, correcting for missing data assumptions in amenity-dependent predictions.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 35 from A or C decks with FoodCourt spending below 1500 and non-zero Spa spending are likely to be transported, mitigating underestimation in moderate luxury expenditures for younger demographics.
