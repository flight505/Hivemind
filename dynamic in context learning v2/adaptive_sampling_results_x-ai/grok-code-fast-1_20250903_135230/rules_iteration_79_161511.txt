PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 79
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with spending exceeding 500 on RoomService, Spa, or VRDeck are unlikely to be transported, regardless of deck, destination, or total spending, addressing high discretionary expenditure patterns that reduce transport likelihood in non-Cryo groups.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged under 10 or over 50, particularly when destined for PSO J318.5-22 or 55 Cancri e instead of TRAPPIST-1e, are unlikely to be transported, refining age biases for CryoSleep passenger handling based on extreme age and non-standard destinations.
3. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Europa or Mars aged 30-60 with spending exceeding 300 on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall are likely to be transported if on A or B decks, adjusting for luxury planet spending habits that override inactivity assumptions in middle-aged non-Cryo demographics.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 16-40 with total spending between 100-1000, particularly on E, F, or G decks destined for TRAPPIST-1e, are unlikely to be transported, correcting moderate expenditure patterns that indicate non-transport preference in young adult Earth groups.
5. Passengers in CryoSleep with all zero or low spending across amenities are likely to be transported if from Mars and aged over 40, extending CryoSleep transport advantages to mature Mars demographics regardless of cabin or destination.
6. Non-CryoSleep Europa passengers with high spending on FoodCourt (exceeding 1000) are likely to be transported despite false CryoSleep status when aged 40 or more and destined for 55 Cancri e or TRAPPIST-1e, refining high-amenity usage in affluent Europa passenger behaviors.
7. Infants and children aged 0-10 from Earth not in CryoSleep with all zero or minimal spending on amenities are unlikely to be transported, overriding any prior assumptions for zero-activity groups in non-Cryo Earth family units.
8. Passengers with unknown or missing cabin data in CryoSleep are likely to be transported if spending is zero across amenities and destination is TRAPPIST-1e, standardizing treatment for cabin-missing CryoSleep cases to favor transport.
9. VIP status in non-Cryo passengers increases transport likelihood only if combined with low spending (under 500 total) on amenities and non-Earth home planets, adjusting for VIP privilege patterns that enhance transport in low-active extraterrestrial groups.
