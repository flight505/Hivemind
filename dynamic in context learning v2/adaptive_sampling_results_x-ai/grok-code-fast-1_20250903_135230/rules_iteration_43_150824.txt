PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 43
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep from G deck cabins with all zero spending and age between 15 and 40 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are generally unlikely to be transported, overriding higher expectations for zero-spending CryoSleep cases in this age group and destination.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep from A or B deck cabins with total FoodCourt and Spa spending exceeding 2000 are unlikely to be transported, emphasizing high luxury expenditures as a risk factor for non-cryogenic mid-age adults regardless of VIP status or other amenities.
3. Mars passengers under age 25 in CryoSleep from E or F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing cryogenic preservation over youthful demographic anomalies.
4. Earth passengers under age 15 not in CryoSleep from G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported unless family group indicators are absent, adjusting for familial dependencies in young non-cryogenic passengers.
5. Non-Earth passengers in CryoSleep from higher deck cabins (A, B, C) with all zero spending are highly likely to be transported across destinations, reinforcing CryoSleep as a strong positive predictor in non-Earth origins.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-35 from F deck cabins with minimal total spending under 100 but above zero are unlikely to be transported if destined for TRAPPIST-1e, highlighting subdued activity as a caution for transportation likelihood in Earth-origin young adults.
7. Passengers with destination PSO J318.5-22 in CryoSleep on G deck cabins are likely to be transported if age exceeds 35 and spending is minimal, countering general CryoSleep trends in less common destinations.
8. Europa passengers over age 50 not in CryoSleep from C deck cabins with zero RoomService but VRDeck spending above 100 are unlikely to be transported, refining elderly demographic behaviors with selective leisure spending patterns.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-40 from F deck cabins with RoomService spending exceeding 1000 and other amenities zero are unlikely to be transported, addressing isolated luxury indulgences in mid-adult Mars demographics.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 40 on G deck cabins destined for PSO J318.5-22 with all zero spending are likely to be transported, emphasizing early-life CryoSleep advantages for alternative destinations.
