PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 98
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 21-29 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining age thresholds for demographic transport trends in under-30 CryoSleep groups with low activity.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 30-45 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, adjusting for age-related inactivity biases in adult CryoSleep segments.
3. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-30 on G deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, correcting for cabin-based activity patterns that favor transport in young non-Cryo demographics.
4. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 1-10 with all zero spending on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, overriding non-Cryo baselines for high-priority small child groups.
5. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 18-25 on F or G deck cabins with low to moderate total spending (under 2000 combined) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, extending youth-focused spending adjustments to broader cabin decks.
6. Non-CryoSleep Earth passengers aged 40-60 on F deck cabins with nonzero spending on at least one amenity destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, mitigating destination-specific outliers in middle-aged expenditure patterns.
7. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-30 with high FoodCourt spending exceeding 4000 and low other amenities destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, prioritizing concentrated food expenditure reversals in adult Europa patterns.
8. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 0-10 with all zero spending on any deck destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, reinforcing high-transport likelihood for non-Cryo infant groups from Europa.
9. Mars passengers in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on F deck cabins with all zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported, correcting for Mars-specific inactivity trends in young CryoSleep segments.
10. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet not in CryoSleep aged 18-25 on F deck cabins with moderate RoomService spending (500-1500) destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, adjusting for missing-homeplanet service expenditure patterns that override defaults.
