PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 73
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with any positive spending on amenities, regardless of cabin deck or destination, are likely to be transported, overriding inactivity biases in non-Cryo adult or adolescent groups with expenditure.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins destined for 55 Cancri e, particularly aged under 30, are unlikely to be transported if all spending is zero, refining CryoSleep risks for younger demographics despite zero-activity patterns.
3. Passengers with unknown HomePlanet but high total spending across amenities and destined for 55 Cancri e are likely to be transported, correcting for missing home variables in active non-Cryo travelers with middle-age profiles.
4. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 18-30 on E or G deck cabins with FoodCourt spending above 500 destined for TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 are likely to be transported, emphasizing youth expenditure trends despite cabin variations.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep aged 14-45 with high ShoppingMall spending and any secondary amenity use destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, highlighting shopping-focused reversals in non-Cryo family groups.
6. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep on G deck cabins aged 20-35 destined for TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported if spending includes RoomService under 100 and other amenities like Spa or VRDeck under 600, overriding low-activity predictions for young adult mid-to-high spenders.
7. Passengers in CryoSleep with unknown cabin locations and zero spending destined for TRAPPIST-1e are unlikely to be transported if aged 25-50, addressing cabin-missing variables in zero-activity non-Europa CryoSleep groups.
