PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 39
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers from Earth, Mars, or Europa with all zero spending are likely to be transported, overriding general CryoSleep baselines for non-luxury groups across various ages and cabin decks.
2. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, regardless of age or destination, prioritizing demographic consistency in basic accommodations.
3. Mars passengers in CryoSleep on F deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are likely to be transported, mitigating underestimation in mid-age independent travelers.
4. Europa passengers in CryoSleep on B or C deck cabins with all zero spending are likely to be transported, addressing transport biases in wealthy demographic segments.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep on high-end cabin decks with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 or combined Spa and VRDeck above 500 are likely to be transported, refining expenditure-driven transport anomalies.
6. Young passengers under age 15 not in CryoSleep with all zero spending on G or F deck cabins are likely to be transported if from Earth or Mars, elevating familial or dependent group transports over activity-based assumptions.
7. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 30-50 with RoomService above 300 and ShoppingMall exceeding 500 are likely to be transported on F deck cabins to TRAPPIST-1e, countering mid-life caution underestimations.
8. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged 25-35 on G deck cabins destined for TRAPPIST-1e with no zero spending in non-RoomService amenities are likely to be transported, reducing budget traveler biases.
9. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep under age 30 on A, B, or C decks with VRDeck spending above 500 are unlikely to be transported unless FoodCourt is zero, prioritizing luxury spending reversals in young elites.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep under age 15 on G deck cabins destined for destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e with all zero spending are unlikely to be transported, mitigating overgeneralizations in familial transport patterns.
