PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 64
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with any cabin deck and zero spending across all amenities are likely to be transported, regardless of age or destination, addressing Europa-centric conservation behaviors.
2. Mars passengers in CryoSleep under age 50 with zero spending are likely to be transported if not in E or G decks, countering age-related anomalies in Mars transport patterns.
3. Earth infants in CryoSleep with any destination and cabin are likely to be transported, prioritizing familial dependency for very young demographics.
4. Non-Europa passengers in CryoSleep aged over 35 with zero spending and destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e are likely to be transported, refining mid-life CryoSleep efficiencies.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending exceeding 2000 and any non-VIP status are likely to be transported, adjusting for high amenity usage overrides.
6. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall spending exceeding 900 and total non-ShoppingMall spending under 500 are likely to be transported, emphasizing Mars retailing priorities.
7. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep aged under 15 with any non-zero FoodCourt spending and G deck cabins are likely to be transported, enhancing youth relaxation exceptions.
8. Europa passengers in CryoSleep from A or B deck cabins with any destination are likely to be transported, incorporating elite deck transport trends.
9. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep aged 20-30 with any non-zero VRDeck or Spa spending and E or F decks are likely to be transported, refining young leisure spending on Mars.
10. Earth passengers in CryoSleep aged 16-30 with PSO J318.5-22 destination and G deck cabins are unlikely to be transported, mitigating young Earth diversion anomalies.
11. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with combined FoodCourt and Spa spending over 3000 and C deck cabins are unlikely to be transported, curbing excessive Europa expenditure tendencies.
12. Mars passengers in CryoSleep with NaN ages and any zero spending are likely to be transported, handling missing data predictability in Mars groups.
