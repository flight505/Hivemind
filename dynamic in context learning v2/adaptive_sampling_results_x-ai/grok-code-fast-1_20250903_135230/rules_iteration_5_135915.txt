PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with primary spending in FoodCourt (between 500 and 2000) and age over 20 are unlikely to be transported, especially if VRDeck and Spa spending is low.
2. Elderly Earth passengers (over 50) not in CryoSleep with any RoomService or FoodCourt spending exceeding 100 are unlikely to be transported, overriding moderate spending patterns.
3. Mars passengers under 30 not in CryoSleep with significant FoodCourt spending (over 1000) and Cabin on F deck are likely to be transported, prioritizing age and destination trends.
4. Earth passengers in CryoSleep on G deck with age between 30 and 50 are likely to be transported if spending is zero across amenities.
5. Young adult Earth passengers (18-30) not in CryoSleep with combined VRDeck and FoodCourt spending under 1000 are likely not transported, focusing on low to moderate amenity usage.
