PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth passengers in CryoSleep are generally likely to be transported unless in cabin sections starting with G, where the likelihood decreases significantly even in CryoSleep.
2. Younger Earth passengers (ages 0-25) not in CryoSleep but with no spending on amenities are moderately likely to be transported, overriding general low-likelihood rules for non-CryoSleep Earth passengers.
3. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate spending (between 100-1000 total across amenities) are more likely to be transported if traveling to 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22.
4. VIP passengers from Europa are more likely to be transported regardless of spending levels, contrary to general VIP spending discounts.
5. Passengers traveling to PSO J318.5-22 with moderate ShoppingMall spending and no CryoSleep are more likely transported if from Earth, emphasizing destination-specific overrides.
6. High spending on FoodCourt (above 2000) for passengers not in CryoSleep from Europa increases transport likelihood, particularly for VIPs in cabin sections starting with A.
