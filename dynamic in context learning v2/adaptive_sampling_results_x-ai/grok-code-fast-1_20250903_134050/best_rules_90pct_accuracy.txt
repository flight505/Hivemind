IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers who are in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported, regardless of other factors.
2. Passengers from Europa are more likely to be transported than those from Earth or Mars, especially if in CryoSleep or traveling to 55 Cancri e.
3. Passengers from Earth who are not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported unless they have moderate to high spending on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall, in which case their likelihood increases.
4. Passengers from Mars are moderately likely to be transported if in CryoSleep, but also if not in CryoSleep and they are young (ages 0-25) or have some spending on FoodCourt, RoomService, or ShoppingMall.
5. Younger passengers (ages 0-25) are more likely to be transported if in CryoSleep, but also if from Mars or Earth not in CryoSleep with no or low overall spending.
6. Older passengers (ages over 50) are less likely to be transported if not in CryoSleep and have spending on amenities, particularly Spa or VRDeck.
7. Passengers with high spending (above 1000 total on any amenity) who are not in CryoSleep are unlikely to be transported, except if the high spending is primarily on FoodCourt and they are from Earth or Mars.
8. Passengers with no spending across all amenities are highly likely to be transported if in CryoSleep, and moderately likely even if not in CryoSleep if they are from Mars and young.
9. VIP passengers are less likely to be transported if they have non-zero spending on amenities, unless they are from Europa.
10. Passengers in cabins starting with A, B, or C are more likely to be transported.
11. Passengers in cabins starting with G, E, or F are less likely to be transported, especially if from Earth and not in CryoSleep, but more likely if from Mars with no spending.
12. Passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e are more likely to be transported if from Europa and in CryoSleep.
13. Passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e are variably likely to be transported, with higher chances for CryoSleep passengers from Europa or non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth with high FoodCourt spending.
14. Passengers with family group indicators (e.g., shared prefixes in IDs) tend to have similar transport outcomes within the group.
15. Moderate spending on FoodCourt or ShoppingMall is associated with higher transport likelihood if the passenger is from Mars or Earth, even without CryoSleep, particularly for ages 18-35.
16. Passengers with any spending on Spa or VRDeck who are not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported, particularly from Earth, unless the spending is minimal and combined with high FoodCourt spending.
17. Passengers with missing age data are more likely to be transported if in CryoSleep and from non-Earth planets.
18. Cabin locations with Port (P) or Starboard (S) have similar transport likelihoods, but combined with CryoSleep status, CryoSleep boosts odds, and for non-CryoSleep, moderate FoodCourt spending from Earth increases likelihood.редел
