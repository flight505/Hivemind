PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with moderate spending (between 100 and 2000 total across amenities) are more likely to be transported, especially if aged 20-60 and traveling to destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e.
2. Passengers in CryoSleep are generally likely to be transported, but for those from Earth aged under 18 or over 60 with no spending, the likelihood decreases if in cabins starting with G.
3. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with moderate to high spending on non-room amenities (e.g., FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) are more likely to be transported if aged 50-70, balancing previous patterns of high spending reducing odds.
4. For passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep, moderate spending (between 400 and 1000 total) on RoomService or ShoppingMall increases transport likelihood, particularly for those aged over 50.
5. Cabin types starting with G or F for non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth show variable likelihood, with increased odds for transport if spending exceeds 500 total and age is between 20-30 or 50-70.
6. Older passengers (aged 50-70) from Earth or Mars not in CryoSleep but with any non-zero spending on amenities are more likely to be transported than previously estimated, especially if from Earth and cabin starts with E or F.
7. Passengers with missing or specific destination data but from Europa exhibit high transport likelihood if in CryoSleep, but for other planets, moderate spending boosts odds when not in CryoSleep.
