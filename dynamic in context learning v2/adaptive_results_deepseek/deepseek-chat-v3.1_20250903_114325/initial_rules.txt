PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported.
2. Passengers with zero or low total expenditure on amenities (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) are more likely to be transported.
3. Passengers from non-Earth home planets (Europa or Mars) have a higher probability of being transported compared to those from Earth.
4. Younger passengers (under 18 years old) show a tendency towards higher transport rates when combined with low spending or CryoSleep status.
5. Passengers traveling in groups (indicated by shared last names) may have correlated transport outcomes, often aligned with the group's overall characteristics.
6. Cabin location on specific decks or sides (e.g., starboard or port) may influence transport likelihood, with certain areas favoring higher rates.
7. VIP status alone does not strongly predict transport, but when combined with other factors like spending, it may indicate lower transport probability for high-spending VIPs.
