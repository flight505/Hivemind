PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 9
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep under 18 with zero spending are more likely to be transported if part of a family group sharing the same cabin, even if other members are in CryoSleep.
2. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending exceeding 1000 are still more likely to be transported unless total Spa and VRDeck spending combined exceeds 7000 or age is above 35, in which case transport likelihood decreases.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep with ShoppingMall and VRDeck spending total exceeding 1000 are more likely to be transported even if RoomService is non-zero but below 200.
4. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending below 100 are less likely to be transported unless Spa or VRDeck spending exceeds 500, particularly for ages between 20 and 40.
5. Passengers from Europa in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if any amenity spending exceeds zero and VIP status is True, overriding standard CryoSleep benefits.
6. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep above 30 with zero spending across all amenities are generally less likely to be transported, especially if destination is TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
7. Passengers destined to PSO J318.5-22 from non-Earth planets not in CryoSleep are more likely transported if FoodCourt spending is above 400, but this likelihood decreases if Spa or VRDeck spending exceeds 300 combined.
8. Young passengers under 18 from Mars not in CryoSleep with zero spending are more likely to be transported if part of a group sharing the same cabin deck.
9. Passengers above 50 from any planet not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if RoomService spending exceeds 50, particularly if total spending is below 2000.
10. Overall, port-side cabin passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely transported if total spending is below 500 and age is between 10 and 50, but this reverses for zero spending in starboard cabins from Earth under 30.
