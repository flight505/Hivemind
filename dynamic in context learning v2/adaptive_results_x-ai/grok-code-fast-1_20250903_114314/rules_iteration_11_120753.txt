PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 11
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 1000 are less likely to be transported if Spa spending exceeds 600, regardless of VIP status or age.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is above 400 and Spa plus VRDeck spending is above 500, especially for ages below 50.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending exceeds 1000 and RoomService is below 300, overriding previous thresholds for those aged 20 to 50.
4. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep under age 18 are more likely to be transported even with low total spending below 500, particularly if in steerage or lower deck cabins like F or G.
5. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep over age 30 with zero spending across amenities are less likely to be transported, unless in VIP status or destined to non-standard destinations like PSO J318.5-22.
6. Non-CryoSleep passengers from any home planet with zero spending are less likely to be transported if over age 35, but more likely if under 18 in group cabins sharing cabin numbers and sides.
7. For destinations like PSO J318.5-22, Earth passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 400, negating high Spa penalties for those under 50.
8. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall plus VRDeck spending exceeds 1500, even with non-zero RoomService below 300 and ages over 40.
9. VIP Europa passengers in CryoSleep are less likely transported if any amenity spending is above zero, but non-VIP counterparts under 18 are more likely regardless of minimal spending.
10. Port-side cabin passengers from Earth under 18 not in CryoSleep are more likely transported with zero spending if their cabin is shared with family members also under 18.
