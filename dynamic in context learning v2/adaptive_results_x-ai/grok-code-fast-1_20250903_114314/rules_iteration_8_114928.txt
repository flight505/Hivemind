PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with total amenity spending below 1000 are more likely to be transported, particularly if age is under 40 and destination is TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
2. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending exceeds 500, even with non-zero RoomService, especially for ages between 20 and 50.
3. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with FoodCourt spending above 1000 are less likely to be transported, especially if Spa or VRDeck spending also exceeds 500, regardless of VIP status or age.
4. Young passengers under 18 from Earth or Mars not in CryoSleep but with zero amenity spending in port-side cabins (P side) are more likely to be transported, overriding standard low-spend non-transport patterns for groups.
5. Passengers above 50 years old not in CryoSleep from Europa are less likely to be transported if any amenity spending exceeds 50, favoring non-transport even with low totals.
6. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep in starboard-side cabins (S side) with high total spending over 2000 across amenities are less likely to be transported, especially if destination is 55 Cancri e.
7. Family groups from Mars or Earth sharing the same cabin deck and port-side, with at least one member under 10 in CryoSleep, have increased transport likelihood for non-CryoSleep members if group spending is mixed.
8. Passengers to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep from Earth or Mars with FoodCourt spending above 300 are more likely to be transported, moderated by low VRDeck spending.
9. VIP passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep with no spending are less likely to be transported compared to non-VIP, but this applies inversely if spending is zero.
10. Overall, non-CryoSleep passengers from non-Earth planets with elevated Spa or VRDeck spending up to 1000 are less likely transported if from Europa, but this threshold increases for Mars passengers in family contexts.
