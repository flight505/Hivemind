PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep with zero total luxury spending are less likely to be transported if from Earth home planet, particularly when in G or E deck cabins and above age 25, opposing the general CryoSleep pattern.
2. Young Earth passengers under 30, not in CryoSleep, with moderate FoodCourt or Spa spending (between 100-2000 total luxury) are more likely transported, overriding lower transport likelihood for non-CryoSleep Earth passengers.
3. Families or group passengers sharing cabins with mixed CryoSleep statuses in F, E, or G decks are unpredictably transported, with a bias toward non-transport when any member is not in CryoSleep and from Earth home planet.
4. Passengers from Mars or Europa not in CryoSleep with high ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending (above 500) but low RoomService are more likely transported, especially under age 40 and headed to TRAPPIST-1e.
5. Older Earth passengers above 50 in CryoSleep with zero spending are less likely transported if in S-side cabins (rightmost side of cabin), adjusting for destination-specific exceptions in CryoSleep rules.
6. Non-VIP passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep with elevated Spa or VRDeck spending (above 500 combined) are more likely transported if under age 35, correcting overgeneralized negative correlations with high spending.
7. Passengers from Mercury or Europa in CryoSleep zero spending bound for 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22 are highly likely transported, but exceptions occur for G or E deck S-side cabins in families without uniform CryoSleep.
8. Teen passengers (13-17) from Earth not in CryoSleep with any nonzero spending in FoodCourt or Spa are more likely transported, expanding on under-18 CryoSleep patterns to non-CryoSleep cases.
9. Cabin port side (P-side) non-Earth passengers not in CryoSleep with zero spending are unpredictably transported, with increased likelihood for groups under 1000 total group CVC spending.
10. High RoomService spending above 1000 for non-CryoSleep passengers over 40 correlates with non-transport across home planets, but non-transport is less certain for Mars passengers headed to TRAPPIST-1e.
