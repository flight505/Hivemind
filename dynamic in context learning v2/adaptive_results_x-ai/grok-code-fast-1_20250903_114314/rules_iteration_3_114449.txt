PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep mode with zero spending across all amenities are less likely to be transported if they are from Earth and assigned to decks E or G, overriding general CryoSleep correlations particularly in family groups with mixed Cryo statuses.
2. Non-CryoSleep passengers from Earth with moderate total spending (between 100 and 1000) across amenities like FoodCourt, Spa, and VRDeck are more likely to be transported, especially when heading to TRAPPIST-1e, regardless of deck or VIP status.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep, particularly on deck F and heading to TRAPPIST-1e, have an increased likelihood of transport if they have any non-zero spending, correcting for underestimation in mixed family groups with varying spending levels.
4. Families or groups sharing the same cabin on decks E or lower with all members not in CryoSleep and minimal or zero spending are more reliably transported, but CryoSleep members in such groups may reduce overall transport likelihood if destined for TRAPPIST-1e.
5. Older passengers (above 40 years) from Earth in CryoSleep with zero spending are less likely to be transported, especially on decks E or G, addressing overestimations in non-family scenarios.
6. Young passengers (under 30 years) from Europa not in CryoSleep with high spending in FoodCourt or Spa have a higher chance of transport despite VIP status, particularly if destined for 55 Cancri e.
7. Passengers from non-Earth planets (Mars or Europa) on deck F, not in CryoSleep, and with low to moderate spending (under 500 total expenditure) are more likely transported when alone in their cabin, distinguishing from group dynamics.
8. High aggregate luxury spending (total Spa, VRDeck, FoodCourt over 3000) combined with CryoSleep still correlates negatively with transport for Europa passengers, refining prior rules on VIP interactions.
