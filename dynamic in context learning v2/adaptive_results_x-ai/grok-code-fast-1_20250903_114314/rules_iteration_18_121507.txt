PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if Spa spending exceeds 600, particularly when combined with high FoodCourt spending over 1000 or VIP status, overriding previous assumptions about elevated Spa alone.
2. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000, especially when paired with VRDeck spending over 100, regardless of low RoomService or age group.
3. Young passengers from Earth under 18 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if total amenity spending is below 100, even in port-side cabins, unless they are in CryoSleep groups but as older dependents.
4. Passengers from Earth to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending is between 400 and 600, with total Spa and VRDeck spending below 300, prioritizing this over room-service penalties.
5. Passengers from any home planet over 50 and not in CryoSleep with RoomService spending above 100 are less likely to be transported, extending the pattern to include Europa origins alongside Earth and Mars.
6. Europa passengers in CryoSleep with VIP status have reduced transport likelihood if any amenity spending is non-zero, reinforcing dependency on complete zero spending across all luxuries.
7. Family groups from Mars sharing cabins have higher transport likelihood when at least one member under 18 is not in CryoSleep but has zero spending, particularly in port-side locations.
8. Port-side cabin passengers from Earth or Mars in CryoSleep over 30 are less likely to be transported if zero spending, unless the group includes multiple young members in CryoSleep.
9. Passengers from non-Earth planets to standard destinations not in CryoSleep are more likely transported with moderate FoodCourt spending (400-1500) combined with low total Spa and VRDeck (below 500), adapting for destination-specific overrides.
10. Overall, non-transport rates increase for passengers from any planet in CryoSleep with age over 30 and any amenity spending above zero, especially in starboard-side cabins to standard colonial destinations.
