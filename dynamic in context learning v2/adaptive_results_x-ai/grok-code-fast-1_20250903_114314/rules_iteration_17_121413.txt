PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if FoodCourt spending exceeds 1000 and Spa spending exceeds 500, regardless of VIP status or age, prioritizing non-transport in cases of luxury overspending.
2. Earth passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if combined FoodCourt, Spa, and VRDeck spending is below 1000 but RoomService is above 100, especially for ages between 15 and 50.
3. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall or VRDeck spending exceeds 500 with zero RoomService, even at older ages, overriding low-transport biases.
4. Young Earth passengers under 15 not in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities are more likely to be transported if sharing cabin sections with other family members, despite isolation tendencies.
5. Europa passengers in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if VIP status is true and any amenity spending is above zero, emphasizing strict zero-spending requirements for VIPs in suspension.
6. Passengers to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if from Earth with FoodCourt spending above 400 and total Spa/VRDeck below 300, favoring steady contributors over excessive indulgences.
7. Passengers from Mars over 40 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if their combined ShoppingMall and FoodCourt spending totals over 1000 with low Spa usage, adapting to high-consumption patterns.
8. General adjustment for non-Earth passengers not in CryoSleep: if age is under 20 and total spending is zero, increase transport likelihood due to youth exemptions, particularly on Mars.
