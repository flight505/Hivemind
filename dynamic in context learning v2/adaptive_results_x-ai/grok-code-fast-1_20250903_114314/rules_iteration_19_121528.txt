PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if Spa spending exceeds 800, even with high FoodCourt spending above 1000, particularly in port-side cabins like B or C decks.
2. Passengers from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if total spending in ShoppingMall and VRDeck exceeds 400, overriding reductions from moderate RoomService or Spa spending up to 600.
3. Passengers from Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending exceeds 1000 and VRDeck spending exceeds 100, regardless of age or RoomService levels.
4. Young passengers under 18 from Earth or Mars not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if spending across all amenities is exactly zero, even in starboard cabins.
5. Passengers over 50 from Europa in non-CryoSleep are less likely to be transported if in VIP status and total amenity spending exceeds 2000, particularly to TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
6. Passengers in CryoSleep from Earth are less likely to be transported if over 18, in E deck cabins, and spending is zero across amenities, regardless of group size or port-side location.
7. Passengers to PSO J318.5-22 from Earth not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if Spa spending is between 200 and 400, combined with FoodCourt spending above 400.
8. Passengers from non-European planets not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if age is under 25 and total spending is below 200, emphasizing low spending and youth factors.
9. Port-side cabin passengers from Europa not in CryoSleep and not VIP are less likely to be transported if all spending is zero, countering prior assumptions for other decks.
10. Overall, passengers not in CryoSleep from any planet are less likely to be transported if ShoppingMall spending alone exceeds 1500, unless balanced by elevated FoodCourt spending over 500.
