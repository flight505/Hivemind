PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep mode have a high likelihood of being transported, particularly when their total luxury spending (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) is zero or very low.
2. Passengers from Earth home planet tend to have a lower likelihood of transport if they have significant spending in luxury services like Spa or VRDeck.
3. Young passengers (under 18 years old) in CryoSleep are strongly likely to be transported, regardless of home planet or cabin details.
4. Passengers from Europa home planet with VIP status but high spending in FoodCourt or Spa have a reduced chance of transport, even if in CryoSleep.
5. Passengers with zero spending across all amenities and from Mars or Europa are more likely to be transported if headed to TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e.
6. Older passengers (above 50 years) not in CryoSleep, especially with elevated RoomService spending, are less likely to be transported.
7. Families or groups sharing similar cabin decks (e.g., same deck letter) with mixed CryoSleep statuses are unpredictably transported unless all are in CryoSleep.
8. Passengers in cabins on port side (rightmost part of PassengerId having P) combined with low spending are more likely transported, particularly for non-VIP Earth passengers.
9. High luxury spending (aggregated Spa, VRDeck, FoodCourt >1000) correlates negatively with transport likelihood, regardless of destination or home planet.
10. Non-Earth passengers headed to PSO J318.5-22 with CryoSleep have increased transport chances, especially if age is below 30 and spending is minimal.
