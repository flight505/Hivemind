PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers not in CryoSleep from Earth with low to moderate spending (total amenities under 5000) to TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e are more likely to be transported than previously estimated, especially if on starboard side cabins.
2. Europa passengers not in CryoSleep with elevated RoomService exceeding 50 but overall moderate luxury spending are less likely to be transported unless in port-side A or B cabins.
3. Earth passengers in CryoSleep with zero spending across all amenities but in starboard-side cabins and headed to destinations other than PSO J318.5-22 are less likely to be transported, countering the assumption for CryoSleep with zero spending.
4. Families or groups sharing identical cabin positions with mixed CryoSleep statuses have a balanced transport likelihood; predict transport only if the majority or key members (adults) are in CryoSleep, reducing false positives for non-Cryo family members.
5. Mars passengers not in CryoSleep with moderate to high ShoppingMall spending exceeding 500 and minimal Spa/VRDeck are more likely to be transported, particularly if aged 18-40.
6. Passengers from Europa or Mars headed to PSO J318.5-22 not in CryoSleep are more likely to be transported if total luxury spending is zero or below 1000, regardless of age.
7. Non-VIP passengers under 18 from any home planet in CryoSleep are still highly likely to be transported, but adjust for starboard-side cabins where likelihood decreases if destination is not TRAPPIST-1e.
8. Older passengers (above 40) from Earth in CryoSleep with zero spending are less likely to be transported, even in port-side cabins, if destination is TRAPPIST-1e.
9. High luxury spending (aggregated above 3000, especially Spa + VRDeck) negatively correlates with transport only for Europa VIPs; non-VIPs from Earth or Mars may still be transported.
10. Passengers not in CryoSleep with total amenities spending between 100 and 1000 to any destination are more likely to be transported if from Earth, provided they are not in G or F cabin decks with VIP status.
