PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers in CryoSleep are highly likely to be transported, as suspended animation provides stable conditions during anomalies.
2. Passengers from Europa, especially those with low overall spending, are more likely to be transported due to their socioeconomic group and destination preferences.
3. Younger passengers (age < 18) are often transported, as they may be prioritized for family safety and lower risk from environmental factors.
4. Passengers with high luxury spending (e.g., Spa, VRDeck, or total amenities > 3000) are less likely to be transported, indicating heightened activity and exposure risk.
5. Passengers from Earth with moderate to high spending are less likely to be transported, reflecting economic and behavioral patterns associated with false destinations.
6. VIP passengers are less likely to be transported, possibly due to higher cabin risks and movement patterns.
7. Passengers on decks A, B, or C are more likely to be transported, as these premium cabins offer better protection and quicker evacuation paths.
8. Passengers with zero spending across all amenities and in CryoSleep are strongly likely to be transported, minimizing activity-related hazards.
9. Passengers from Mars destined for TRAPPIST-1e with elevated RoomService or ShoppingMall spending are more likely to be transported, tied to their resourceful planet origins.
10. Elderly passengers (age > 50) with high FoodCourt spending are less likely to be transported, suggesting vulnerability combined with discretionary expenses.
11. Passengers with NaN values in critical fields like HomePlanet or Cabin are more likely to be transported if CryoSleep is True, as data gaps may correlate with assigned protective measures.
12. Passengers from non-Earth planets targeting 55 Cancri e are more likely to be transported, influenced by planetary affiliation and high-value destinations.
