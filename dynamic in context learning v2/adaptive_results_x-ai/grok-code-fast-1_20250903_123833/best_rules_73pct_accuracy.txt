PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep is True, predict True (transport) due to higher survival likelihood in suspended states.
2. If HomePlanet is Europa, predict True (transport) as these passengers exhibit distinct transport patterns.
3. If Age is under 13, predict True (transport) given demographic dependencies on family and safety protocols.
4. If total spending on amenities (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) exceeds 500, predict False (not transport) reflecting engagement in active leisure activities.
5. If CryoSleep is False and HomePlanet is Earth, predict False (not transport) aligned with planetary evacuation priorities.
6. If Cabin deck is G and CryoSleep is False, predict False (not transport) influenced by shared accommodation arrangements.
7. If VIP is True, predict False (not transport) associated with elevated disruption risks from high-status services.
8. If Age is over 60, predict True (transport) considering age-related evacuation protocols.
9. If Destination is PSO J318.5-22 and HomePlanet is Earth, predict True (transport) due to migration incentive alignments.
10. If Cabin side is P (Port) and spending on RoomService is zero, predict True (transport) indicative of efficient resource allocation.
11. If HomePlanet is Mars and CryoSleep is True, predict True (transport) combining efficiency with adaptability traits.
12. If total spending is zero and Age is between 18 and 40, predict True (transport) for minimal-risk profiles.
13. If Cabin deck is A or B, predict True (transport) tied to premium evacuation access.
14. If Destination is 55 Cancri e and VIP is True, predict False (not transport) balancing luxury with heightened event exposure.
15. If CryoSleep is False and spending on VRDeck exceeds 200, predict False (not transport) from over-reliance on virtual environments.
