PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep is True, predict True due to higher survival likelihood in suspended states, but override to False if HomePlanet is Earth and Destination is TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 and Age is between 20 and 60 for these planetary evacuation scenarios.
2. If HomePlanet is Europa, predict True as these passengers exhibit distinct transport patterns, but if CryoSleep is False and total spending exceeds 1000, adjust prediction to False due to potential risk factors in active leisure.
3. If Age is under 13, predict True given demographic dependencies on family and safety protocols, and extend to Age under 18 if Cabinet deck is not F and spending on RoomService is zero for broader child protection.
4. If total spending on amenities exceeds 500, predict False reflecting engagement in active leisure activities, but predict True if HomePlanet is Mars and spending is primarily on ShoppingMall and VRDeck for adaptability traits.
5. If CryoSleep is False and HomePlanet is Earth, predict False aligned with planetary evacuation priorities, but predict True if spending on FoodCourt and ShoppingMall combined exceeds 400 and Spa is zero for minimum disruption profiles.
6. If Cabin deck is G and CryoSleep is False, predict False influenced by shared accommodation arrangements, but override to True if Age is over 40 and spending on RoomService exceeds 500 for age-related flexibility.
7. If VIP is True, predict False associated with elevated disruption risks from high-status services, and apply even if Destination is 55 Cancri e to balance luxury with event exposure.
8. If Age is over 60, predict True considering age-related evacuation protocols, but if CryoSleep is True and total spending is zero, refine to False for resource allocation efficiency.
9. If Destination is PSO J318.5-22 and HomePlanet is Earth, predict True due to migration incentive alignments, but only if CryoSleep is True and Age under 45 to prioritize efficiency.
10. If Cabin side is P (Port) and spending on RoomService is zero, predict True indicative of efficient resource allocation, and extend to Cabin side S if FoodCourt spending exceeds 200.
11. If HomePlanet is Mars and CryoSleep is True, predict True combining efficiency with adaptability traits, but if Age is over 50, maintain for senior support needs.
12. If total spending is zero and Age is between 18 and 40, predict True for minimal-risk profiles, but if Destination is non-economic like TRAPPIST-1e and HomePlanet is not Europa, predict accordingly based on shelter.
13. If Cabin deck is A or B, predict True tied to premium evacuation access, regardless of CryoSleep if spending is below 300 and VIP is False.
14. If Destination is 55 Cancri e and VIP is True, predict False balancing luxury with heightened event exposure, but if HomePlanet is Europa, retain True for elite accommodations.
15. If CryoSleep is False and spending on VRDeck exceeds 200, predict False from over-reliance on virtual environments, but predict True if paired with high FoodCourt spending over 300 for social engagement.
16. If CryoSleep is True and total spending exceeds 100, predict False prioritizing cryostasis efficiency over material consumption, targeting Earth passengers with cabin deck F.
17. If Cabin deck is E and HomePlanet is Mars, predict False unless Age under 25 and CryoSleep False for developmental risk assessments.
18. If VIP is False and Age is between 25 and 50, predict True for stable demographic evacuation, but if Cabin side is S and spending on Spa exceeds 50, adjust to False for expenditure anomalies.
19. If Destination is TRAPPIST-1e and HomePlanet is Earth and CryoSleep False, predict False due to alignment with main evacuation streams, unless Family size inferred from Cabin numbers exceeds 1.
20. If Age is between 13 and 30 and total spending is between 100 and 500, predict True for young adult resilience, but False if Cabin deck is G and CryoSleep False.
