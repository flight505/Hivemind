PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If CryoSleep is True, predict Transported as True, as passengers in cryogenic sleep generally have higher survival rates due to reduced activity.
2. If CryoSleep is False and total spending on luxuries (FoodCourt + Spa + VRDeck) exceeds 1000, predict Transported as False, due to resource consumption patterns.
3. If HomePlanet is Europa, predict Transported as True, as European passengers typically align with transport success.
4. If HomePlanet is Earth and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported as False, reflecting lower transport rates for active Earth inhabitants.
5. If Age is less than 18, predict Transported as True, based on demographic advantages for younger passengers.
6. If Age is greater than 50 and VIP is True, predict Transported as False, as older VIPs have lower success rates.
7. If HomePlanet is Mars and CryoSleep is False, predict Transported as True if ShoppingMall spending is high (above 100), otherwise False.
8. If Destination is 55 Cancri e and HomePlanet is Europa, predict Transported as True, matching planetary-destination preference patterns.
9. If Cabin deck is B or C (first letter), predict Transported as True, due to location-based advantages.
10. If Cabin deck is F or G and Age is between 20 and 40, predict Transported as False with high spending on RoomService or VRDeck.
11. If VIP is True, predict Transported as False, as VIP status correlates with lower transport likelihood.
12. If total spending is 0.0 across all categories and CryoSleep is True, predict Transported as True.
13. If HomePlanet is Earth and Destination is PSO J318.5-22, predict Transported as False unless CryoSleep is True.
14. If passengers in a group (same Cabin or similar PassengerId endings) have mixed CryoSleep statuses, predict for the CryoSleep True members as True and others as False.
