IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If CryoSleep = True AND Cabin deck = G AND Destination = 55 Cancri e THEN predict Transported = False]
2. [If CryoSleep = True AND HomePlanet = Earth AND Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND Cabin deck = G AND Age >= 30 THEN predict Transported = False]
3. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_spend = 0 AND HomePlanet = Earth AND Cabin deck = G AND cabin_number >= 1000 THEN predict Transported = False]
4. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep != True AND HomePlanet = Europa AND total_spend >= 3000 THEN predict Transported = True]
5. [If Destination = 55 Cancri e AND CryoSleep != True AND (ShoppingMall >= 550 OR FoodCourt >= 700) THEN predict Transported = True]
6. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND HomePlanet = Earth AND CryoSleep != True AND ShoppingMall >= 700 THEN predict Transported = True]
7. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep != True AND Age <= 12 AND total_spend = 0 THEN predict Transported = True]
8. [If VIP = True AND CryoSleep != True AND Destination != TRAPPIST-1e AND total_spend > 500 THEN predict Transported = False]
9. [If HomePlanet = Mars AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
10. [If Destination = PSO J318.5-22 AND CryoSleep != True AND (HomePlanet != Earth OR ShoppingMall < 700) THEN predict Transported = False]
11. [If total_spend >= 2500 AND CryoSleep != True AND (HomePlanet != Europa OR Destination != TRAPPIST-1e) THEN predict Transported = False]
12. [If (ShoppingMall > 900 OR VRDeck > 1200) AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
13. [If Cabin deck ∈ {F, G, T} AND Destination != TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep != True AND total_spend <= 500 THEN predict Transported = False]
14. [If Cabin deck ∈ {B, C, D, E} AND CryoSleep != True AND total_spend <= 100 THEN predict Transported = True]
15. [If CryoSleep = True AND total_spend (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall+Spa+VRDeck) <= 10 THEN predict Transported = True]
16. [If CryoSleep is missing AND total_spend = 0 THEN predict Transported = True]
17. [If HomePlanet = Europa AND CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True]
18. [If Destination = TRAPPIST-1e AND CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True]
19. [If any immediate family/group member (same group identifier before underscore or same cabin number) is in CryoSleep = True THEN predict Transported = True for the whole group]
20. [If group_total_spend >= 4000 AND no one in the group is in CryoSleep THEN predict Transported = False for the group]
21. [If Age >= 60 AND CryoSleep != True AND total_spend > 0 THEN predict Transported = False]
22. [If Age < 12 AND CryoSleep != True AND Destination != TRAPPIST-1e THEN predict Transported = False]
23. [If count_of_nonzero_spend_categories >= 4 AND CryoSleep != True THEN predict Transported = False]
24. [Otherwise (no rule matched) THEN predict Transported = False]
