PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa-origin passengers with moderate spending (500-3000 total) show elevated transport probability, particularly when spending is concentrated in FoodCourt while maintaining zero or low spending in other amenities, contrary to the general high-spending rule

2. Passengers aged 18-25 and 50-70 with CryoSleep disabled demonstrate increased transport likelihood when exhibiting selective spending patterns, especially when spending is focused on 1-2 amenities rather than distributed broadly

3. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability compared to other destinations, requiring destination-specific adjustment to the zero-spending transport rule

4. Cabin decks B and C demonstrate significantly higher transport rates for Europa-origin passengers across all spending levels, indicating deck-origin interaction effects

5. Passengers with missing CryoSleep data but zero expenditures across all amenities should be treated as having CryoSleep enabled for transport prediction purposes

6. Intermediate age passengers (25-45) with mixed spending patterns (some zero, some non-zero expenditures) show elevated transport probability when the non-zero spending occurs in Spa or VRDeck amenities

7. Groups with mixed transport outcomes in training data indicate that family/group transport patterns are not absolute, requiring individual feature evaluation when group patterns conflict

8. Passengers with exactly one non-zero expenditure category showing values between 500-2000 demonstrate higher transport probability regardless of total spending amount

9. Missing expenditure patterns where 3+ amenities show NaN values correlate with higher transport probability, distinct from both zero-spending and normal spending patterns

10. VIP status modifies transport probability primarily for passengers with total spending exceeding 2000, reducing transport likelihood more significantly than for non-VIP high spenders
