PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Mars-origin passengers with moderate total spending (2000-8000 range) across amenities show elevated transport probability, particularly when traveling to 55 Cancri e
2. Earth-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled but zero expenditures demonstrate variable transport outcomes based on destination, with reduced transport likelihood for PSO J318.5-22 destinations
3. Passengers with missing CryoSleep data but zero expenditures across all amenities show increased transport probability, especially when combined with Earth origin
4. Intermediate age passengers (30-50) from Mars with balanced spending patterns (multiple amenities with non-zero but moderate values) show higher transport rates than previously predicted
5. Cabin decks E and F passengers demonstrate distinct transport patterns when combined with Mars origin and moderate spending levels
6. VIP status modifies transport probability for zero-spending passengers, reducing transport likelihood particularly for Earth-origin passengers
7. Passengers with missing age data but substantial FoodCourt spending (>1000) show increased transport probability regardless of other amenities
8. Group transport patterns show stronger correlation for Mars-origin groups with mixed spending patterns than previously accounted for
9. Missing expenditure data in ShoppingMall combined with non-zero spending in other amenities correlates with higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers
10. Destination TRAPPIST-1e shows higher transport probability thresholds for spending patterns, requiring higher aggregate spending to indicate non-transport status
11. Elderly passengers (Age > 60) from Earth with any non-zero spending show reduced transport probability compared to zero-spending elderly passengers
12. Cabin deck G passengers with Earth origin and CryoSleep enabled show variable transport outcomes based on specific destination-spending combinations
13. Passengers with single-amenity high spending patterns (>5000 in one category) demonstrate different transport probabilities based on home planet and specific amenity type
14. Missing VIP status data combined with zero expenditures shows different transport patterns based on cabin deck and destination combination
15. Children (Age < 13) with any non-zero spending show modified transport probabilities that vary by home planet and destination
