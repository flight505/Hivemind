PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, but transport probability is significantly reduced for destinations 55 Cancri e and PSO J318.5-22, especially when age is missing or extreme (e.g., age >60).

2. High total expenditures (>5000) do not reduce transport probability for Europa-origin passengers or for destinations TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e; for Earth-origin, reduced probability only applies if spending exceeds 3000 for non-VIP or 5000 for VIP.

3. Passengers aged 0 without CryoSleep have very low transport probability (<10%) regardless of spending or destination, while ages 1-12 with no spending show elevated transport rates except when traveling to 55 Cancri e.

4. Moderate expenditures (500-2500) reduce transport probability only if concentrated in Spa or VRDeck (exceeding 60% of total spending); expenditures in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall have minimal impact on transport likelihood.

5. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show destination-dependent transport: lower probability for 55 Cancri e only with low spending (<500), but high spending (>2000) overrides this reduction for all destinations.

6. Missing age data correlates with reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers (especially to TRAPPIST-1e), but for Europa-origin, missing age indicates higher transport probability.

7. In group travel, passengers aged 0-2 have reduced transport probability compared to older members if not in CryoSleep, while groups of 3+ maintain high transport consistency regardless of age.

8. Cabin decks G and F: Deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates only with low spending (<800), but to 55 Cancri e, Deck G shows reduced probability; Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have elevated rates regardless of spending.

9. VIP status reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e by 40%, but for other destinations, VIP has minimal effect unless combined with high spending (>4000).

10. Expenditure distribution: Concentrated spending in Spa or VRDeck (>60% of total) reduces transport probability across all origins and destinations, while balanced or FoodCourt-dominated spending does not.
