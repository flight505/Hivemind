PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 57
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported, except for Earth and Europa origins traveling to TRAPPIST-1e where transport probability is reduced, particularly for ages above 12. For 55 Cancri e and other destinations, transport probability remains high for all ages.

2. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when total expenditures exceed 3000 or travel to 55 Cancri e. For non-Earth origins, reduced transport probability occurs only for very high spending thresholds: non-VIP above 4000, VIP above 5000.

3. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures and CryoSleep disabled show high transport probability regardless of destination. With CryoSleep enabled, transport probability is high for destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e; for TRAPPIST-1e, transport probability is reduced.

4. Missing expenditure data (any NaN value) indicates higher transport probability for Earth and Europa origin passengers. Missing destination data suggests higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers.

5. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on destination: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability.

6. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition.

7. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) demonstrate high transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers even with moderate spending up to 2000, but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending.

8. VIP status increases transport probability for passengers with high total expenditures (>2000 for non-Earth, >3000 for Earth) except for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e where VIPs show lower transport rates.

9. Expenditure distribution patterns: Concentrated spending in a single amenity does not significantly reduce transport probability; instead, very high total spending (>5000) may reduce transport likelihood across all destinations.

10. For passengers with no CryoSleep and significant spending, transport probability is generally higher for TRAPPIST-1e destinations regardless of origin, with Earth and Mars origins showing elevated rates.
