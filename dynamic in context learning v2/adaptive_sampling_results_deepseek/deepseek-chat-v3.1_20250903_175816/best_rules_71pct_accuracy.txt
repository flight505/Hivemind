PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures across all amenities (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) are more likely to be transported
2. Higher total spending across amenities (particularly exceeding aggregate thresholds) correlates with lower transport probability
3. Children (Age < 13) and elderly passengers (Age > 60) with CryoSleep enabled show elevated transport rates
4. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate higher transport likelihood compared to other home planets when controlling for other factors
5. Passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show different transport patterns than those bound for 55 Cancri e or PSO J318.5-22
6. Cabin deck location (first letter of Cabin designation) shows stratification in transport probability, with certain decks favoring transport
7. Passengers with VIP status demonstrate modified spending-transport relationships compared to non-VIP passengers
8. Group identifiers (numeric suffix in PassengerId) indicate family/group transport patterns where members typically share transport outcomes
9. Missing expenditure data patterns (multiple NaN values) correlate with specific transport probabilities distinct from zero-spending patterns
10. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show more variable transport outcomes that are highly dependent on spending behaviors and destination
