PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 48
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability when under age 13 or traveling to TRAPPIST-1e on G deck, overriding previous high-likelihood assumptions for these subgroups

2. Earth-origin passengers with total expenditures between 600-2000 demonstrate elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e, contradicting previous high-spending reduction patterns for this demographic

3. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity maintain reduced transport probability except when traveling in groups of 3+ with consistent transport patterns

4. Cabin deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show stratified transport outcomes: higher rates for those with moderate spending (200-800) but lower rates for zero-spending CryoSleep passengers

5. Missing expenditure data patterns require destination-specific interpretation: Earth-origin passengers with multiple NaN values show increased transport probability to PSO J318.5-22 but decreased to TRAPPIST-1e

6. Intermediate age ranges (20-30) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with balanced spending distribution (<60% in any single category)

7. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, where VIPs show 25% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts with similar spending

8. Expenditure distribution patterns matter more than total spending: passengers spending >70% in any single amenity category show reduced transport probability across all destinations except 55 Cancri e

9. Group transport consistency weakens for Earth-origin pairs traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with mixed age composition, requiring individual assessment based on spending patterns

10. Cabin deck F passengers show elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending when accompanied by CryoSleep status, except for those with concentrated Spa expenditures exceeding 50% of total spending
