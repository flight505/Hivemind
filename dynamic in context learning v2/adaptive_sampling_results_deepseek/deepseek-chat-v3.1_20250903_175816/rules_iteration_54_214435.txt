PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 54
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport probability even with moderate total spending (500-2000 range), with transport likelihood decreasing only above 2000 total expenditure

2. Passengers with completely zero expenditures across all amenities show high transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status when destination is TRAPPIST-1e, except for children under 15 traveling to 55 Cancri e

3. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates high transport probability for all destinations except PSO J318.5-22

4. Moderate spending (300-1500 total) among Mars-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e correlates with increased transport probability rather than decreased

5. Children aged 0-12 with any missing expenditure data (NaN values) show higher transport probability than those with recorded zero expenditures

6. Passengers with concentrated spending in ShoppingMall (>60% of total) demonstrate increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of HomePlanet

7. Missing destination data combined with any spending activity indicates reduced transport probability across all age groups and origins

8. Europa-origin passengers with total expenditures between 1000-3000 show elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, contrasting with lower probability for Earth-origin passengers in same spending range

9. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain high transport probability even with moderate spending (up to 1500 total), overriding typical spending thresholds

10. Passengers aged 13-17 with missing VIP status data show transport patterns similar to non-VIP passengers rather than VIP passengers

11. Groups of 2 passengers with both members aged 25-45 show >80% same-transport outcome when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, regardless of spending patterns

12. Missing age data combined with zero expenditures indicates high transport probability for all destinations except 55 Cancri e

13. Passengers with any NaN expenditure values but total calculated spending <500 show transport probability patterns similar to those with complete zero expenditures

14. Earth-origin passengers to PSO J318.5-22 require complete zero expenditures for high transport probability, with any spending activity significantly reducing transport likelihood

15. Cabin deck G passengers show destination-dependent transport patterns: high probability for TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending, but reduced probability for 55 Cancri e even with zero expenditures
