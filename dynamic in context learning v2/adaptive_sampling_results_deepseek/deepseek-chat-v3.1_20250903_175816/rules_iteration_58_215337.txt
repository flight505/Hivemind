PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 58
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with moderate total spending (500-3000) and balanced expenditure distribution (no single amenity exceeding 45% of total spending) show elevated transport probability across all destinations, overriding previous strict VIP-based spending thresholds

2. Teenage passengers (13-19 years) demonstrate destination-specific transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with any spending activity, but reduced probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending

3. Missing expenditure data (NaN values) now indicates higher transport probability when occurring with Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, but remains indicative of lower probability for Mars-origin passengers to all destinations

4. Cabin deck F passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show consistently high transport rates regardless of spending patterns or age, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e maintain reduced transport probability

5. Passengers with concentrated spending patterns (single amenity exceeding 60% of total) now show variable transport outcomes based on destination: Reduced probability for TRAPPIST-1e but elevated probability for 55 Cancri e when Spa or VRDeck spending dominates

6. Earth-origin passengers aged 20-35 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with any spending activity demonstrate significantly higher transport rates, overriding previous high-spending penalty rules

7. CryoSleep-disabled passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability only when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, while showing reduced probability for 55 Cancri e regardless of other factors

8. Group transport consistency now applies to all group sizes (2+ members) with same-transport probability exceeding 85% when all members share identical CryoSleep status and expenditure patterns

9. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show reversed destination-dependent patterns: Higher transport probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with moderate spending (800-2000), but lower probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with similar spending

10. VIP status primarily modifies transport probability for 55 Cancri e travelers, where VIPs show 25% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts when combined with moderate spending (1000-3000)
