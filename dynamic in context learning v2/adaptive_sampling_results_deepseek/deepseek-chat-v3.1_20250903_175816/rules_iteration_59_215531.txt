PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 59
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e where transport probability decreases for ages under 15, and for all ages when HomePlanet is Earth

2. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate elevated transport rates even with moderate spending (up to 2500 total), with reduced transport probability only when spending exceeds 3000 total or when accompanied by concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 70% of total

3. Moderate spending thresholds vary by VIP status and destination: Non-VIP passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures 500-3500 show reduced transport probability, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2500-5000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood

4. Passengers aged 0-15 with any spending activity (≥1 across amenities) show significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, except when traveling in groups of 3+ where family transport consistency overrides individual spending patterns

5. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on destination and home planet: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates regardless of origin, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability except for Europa-origin passengers

6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with destination-specific transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers across all destinations, but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size and age composition: Groups of 3+ members show >95% same-transport outcome, while pairs show variable patterns dependent on youngest member's age (under 12 reduces transport probability for both)

8. Intermediate age ranges (20-50) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low-moderate spending (<1000), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with any spending activity

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 50% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts, and for Mars-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e where VIP status increases transport probability

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 50% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations, except for Europa-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

11. Age-dependent transport patterns vary by home planet: Earth-origin passengers aged 15-30 show elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending, while Mars-origin passengers in same age range require low spending (<500) for high transport probability

12. Missing CryoSleep data correlates with transport outcomes based on expenditure patterns: NaN CryoSleep with zero spending behaves like CryoSleep=True, while NaN CryoSleep with any spending behaves like CryoSleep=False for transport prediction

13. Cabin side (P/S) modifies transport probability: Starboard side (S) passengers show 15% higher transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of home planet, while Port side (P) passengers show reduced transport probability to 55 Cancri e

14. Expenditure volatility patterns affect transport probability: Passengers with high spending variance across amenities (standard deviation > mean expenditure) show reduced transport likelihood across all destinations except PSO J318.5-22

15. Family group composition overrides individual characteristics: When traveling with children under 12, entire family group shows increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of individual spending patterns or home planet origin
