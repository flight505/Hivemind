PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 28
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures between 300-yet under 1500 have reduced transport probability, especially for those aged 25-60 regardless of expenditure distribution

2. CryoSleep passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability except when destined for 55 Cancri e, where transport rates decrease by approximately 30% for all age groups

3. Mars-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show 85%+ transport probability across all destinations, contrary to previous Earth-focused assumptions

4. Children under 13 with any spending activity (>0 in any amenity) show 70% reduced transport probability, but this effect diminishes completely if CryoSleep is enabled

5. Elderly passengers (65+) with moderate total spending (500-2000) demonstrate 40% higher transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e compared to other destinations

6. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data (all amenities NaN) show destination-dependent transport patterns: 80% transport probability for Europa-origin, 20% for Earth-origin, and 60% for Mars-origin

7. Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport rates except when combined with Earth origin and spending exceeding 800 total

8. Deck G passengers show 25% lower transport probability to 55 Cancri e regardless of other factors, but this is reversed for Mars-origin passengers

9. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) with concentrated spending in any single amenity exceeding 65% of total expenditures show 35% reduced transport probability

10. VIP status provides no transport probability modification for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with spending under 1000, contradicting previous Earth-VIP interaction rules

11. Groups of 2 with both members in CryoSleep show 95% transport consistency, while mixed CryoSleep status groups show only 60% consistency

12. Missing age values combined with zero expenditures indicate 75% transport probability for CryoSleep passengers, but only 25% for non-CryoSleep passengers
