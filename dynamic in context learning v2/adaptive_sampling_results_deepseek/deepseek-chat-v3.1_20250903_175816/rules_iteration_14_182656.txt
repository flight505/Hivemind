PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures exceeding 500 show significantly reduced transport probability, particularly when spending is concentrated in RoomService or Spa amenities

2. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability except when originating from Earth and traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, where additional age verification (under 30) further reduces transport likelihood

3. Mars-origin passengers with RoomService expenditures exceeding 1000 demonstrate substantially reduced transport probability regardless of destination, with the effect amplified for TRAPPIST-1e travelers

4. Europa-origin passengers with FoodCourt expenditures exceeding 5000 show elevated transport probability to 55 Cancri e but reduced probability to TRAPPIST-1e, requiring destination-specific evaluation

5. Missing cabin data combined with Mars origin and TRAPPIST-1e destination indicates substantially reduced transport probability, particularly when accompanied by moderate-to-high expenditure patterns

6. Passengers aged 20-35 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures between 600-3000 show reduced transport probability, with the threshold varying by planetary origin (lower for Earth, higher for Mars/Europa)

7. Concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 70% of total expenditures (particularly Spa or VRDeck) correlates with reduced transport probability for all destinations except 55 Cancri e

8. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show variable transport probability based on cabin deck: reduced for decks F/G, elevated for decks A-C

9. Moderate VIP passengers (expenditures 1000-4000) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport probability regardless of planetary origin, contradicting previous VIP behavior patterns

10. Missing expenditure data patterns combined with Earth origin indicate reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e but elevated probability to PSO J318.5-22, requiring destination-specific interpretation

11. Passengers with total expenditures between 800-2500 distributed across 3+ amenities show reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, while similar spending patterns show elevated probability to 55 Cancri e

12. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with any Mars or Earth origin demonstrate reduced transport probability when accompanied by RoomService expenditures exceeding 500
