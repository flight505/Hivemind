PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures show elevated transport probability except when traveling to 55 Cancri e or when originating from Mars, where transport likelihood decreases significantly
2. Children under 5 years old with zero expenditures demonstrate high transport rates regardless of CryoSleep status, particularly when traveling with family groups
3. Passengers with moderate spending (100-2000 total across amenities) show variable transport outcomes that depend heavily on destination - TRAPPIST-1e travelers with moderate spending have higher transport probability while 55 Cancri e travelers with similar spending show reduced transport rates
4. Earth-origin passengers maintain higher transport likelihood except when accompanied by high Spa/VRDeck expenditures exceeding 1500 combined, which reduces transport probability
5. Cabin decks F and G show distinct transport patterns - Deck F passengers with any spending demonstrate lower transport rates while Deck G passengers follow standard spending-transport relationships
6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with transport outcomes differently based on home planet - Europa passengers with missing data show elevated transport rates while Earth passengers with missing data show reduced transport probability
7. VIP status modifies transport probability primarily for passengers aged 30-50, where VIPs demonstrate reversed spending-transport relationships compared to non-VIP passengers
8. Group travel patterns show strongest correlation for children and elderly passengers, where transport outcomes typically match within groups containing members under 13 or over 60
9. Passengers with exclusive FoodCourt spending (other amenities at zero) demonstrate higher transport probability regardless of destination, particularly when spending exceeds 500
10. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show destination-dependent transport patterns where TRAPPIST-1e travelers have higher transport rates while 55 Cancri e travelers have lower transport probability when controlling for spending
11. Mars-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero spending show reduced transport probability compared to other home planets under identical conditions
12. Passengers with balanced spending across multiple amenities (3+ services with non-zero values) demonstrate lower transport probability than those with focused spending patterns
