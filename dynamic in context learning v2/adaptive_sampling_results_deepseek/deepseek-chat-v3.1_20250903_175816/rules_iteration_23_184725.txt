PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 23
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures between 200-2000 credits and non-zero amenity usage show significantly reduced transport probability, particularly when spending is concentrated in 2+ amenities

2. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled but missing expenditure data (NaN values) show reduced transport probability across all destinations except for Europa-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

3. Moderate spending thresholds for transport reduction are lowered for TRAPPIST-1e destinations: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures 200-1500 show 40% lower transport rates, while VIP passengers show reduced transport at 1000-3000 spending levels

4. Passengers aged 15-45 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate dramatically reduced transport probability when showing any Spa or VRDeck expenditure exceeding 30% of total spending

5. Cabin decks E, F, and G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show stratified transport patterns based on expenditure concentration: Those with spending spread across 3+ amenities have higher transport rates, while those with concentrated single-amenity spending show reduced transport

6. Missing age data combined with any expenditure activity correlates with 60% lower transport probability for all destinations except 55 Cancri e

7. Passengers with zero expenditures across all amenities but missing CryoSleep data show reduced transport probability regardless of destination, except for children under 5

8. Earth-origin passengers aged 18-35 traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show particularly low transport rates (25% baseline) regardless of VIP status, with spending thresholds further reducing probability

9. Expenditure distribution patterns are destination-specific: TRAPPIST-1e travelers with balanced spending across amenities show higher transport rates, while 55 Cancri e travelers show opposite patterns

10. Group transport consistency weakens for Earth-origin pairs and small families (2-3 members) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, showing more variable transport outcomes than previously estimated
