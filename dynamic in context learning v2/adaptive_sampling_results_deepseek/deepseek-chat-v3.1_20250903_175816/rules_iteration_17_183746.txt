PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers with zero expenditures across all amenities and not in CryoSleep show significantly reduced transport probability, overriding any destination-based advantages

2. Mars-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability across all destinations except when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e where additional age filters apply (reduced transport likelihood for ages 18-30)

3. Expenditure concentration patterns override total spending thresholds: Passengers with >70% of total spending in any single amenity (particularly FoodCourt or VRDeck) show reduced transport probability regardless of VIP status or destination

4. Cabin deck F passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total spending (200-1500) demonstrate elevated transport probability, except when exhibiting concentrated spending patterns

5. Missing CryoSleep data combined with Earth origin and any spending activity indicates reduced transport probability across all destinations

6. Passengers aged 40-65 with Earth origin and total expenditures between 800-3000 show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly when spending is distributed across multiple amenities

7. Europa-origin passengers with extremely high total expenditures (>8000) maintain elevated transport probability regardless of destination or age, overriding normal spending threshold rules

8. Group size modifies transport probability based on spending distribution: Families of 2+ members with balanced spending across amenities show increased transport consistency to all destinations

9. Cabin deck G passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of CryoSleep status, but show reduced probability to 55 Cancri e when combined with Earth origin

10. Intermediate age ranges (20-35) demonstrate destination-dependent transport reversal: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low spending (<500), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with similar spending patterns

11. Missing expenditure data combined with Mars origin indicates context-dependent transport outcomes: Higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e destination but lower probability for 55 Cancri e destination

12. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for high-spending Earth-origin passengers (>2000 total), where VIPs show 25% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all destinations
