PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 41
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Europa-origin passengers with extremely high FoodCourt expenditure (>4000) and at least one other nominal amenity expense remain highly likely to be transported regardless of other spending patterns, especially when traveling to 55 Cancri e

2. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures show reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e on Deck G, requiring re-evaluation of cabin-deck-destination interactions

3. Passengers with missing destination data demonstrate elevated transport probability when showing moderate spending (200-1000 total) with balanced distribution across amenities

4. Intermediate age passengers (20-40) traveling to PSO J318.5-22 show increased transport probability when exhibiting focused spending in ShoppingMall (>500) with minimal other expenses

5. Mars-origin passengers with total expenditures between 800-3000 show higher transport probability when spending is distributed across at least three different amenities

6. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data (all amenities NaN) demonstrate destination-dependent outcomes: higher transport for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e

7. Group travel patterns require refinement: pairs traveling together show 85% transport consistency when both have zero expenditures, dropping to 60% when only one member has expenditures

8. VIP status significantly increases transport probability for passengers with moderate total spending (500-2000) traveling to 55 Cancri e, reversing the typical Earth-origin penalty

9. Children aged 0-12 with any Spa expenditure show increased transport probability when traveling with family groups to TRAPPIST-1e

10. Cabin deck B passengers demonstrate consistently high transport rates regardless of spending patterns when originating from Europa

11. Passengers with highly concentrated VRDeck spending (>70% of total) show reduced transport probability except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22

12. Missing age data correlates with higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers with total expenditures below 500

13. Intermediate spending ranges (1000-2500 total) show destination-specific transport patterns: increased for TRAPPIST-1e, decreased for 55 Cancri e when not from Europa

14. Passengers with RoomService as primary expenditure (>50% of total) demonstrate reduced transport probability across all destinations except PSO J318.5-22

15. Elderly passengers (65+) with zero expenditures show elevated transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status when not originating from Earth
