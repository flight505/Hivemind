PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 63
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e and aged between 18 and 24, where transport probability is reduced.

2. Moderate spending thresholds for Non-VIP passengers are elevated for Earth-origin travelers to TRAPPIST-1e aged 18-24, with spending between 500-1500 not reducing transport probability.

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when accompanied by high spending patterns (>1500 total) or travel to 55 Cancri e, but moderate spending to TRAPPIST-1e for ages 18-24 maintains high probability.

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity (â‰¥1) show reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, and those with zero expenditures and CryoSleep disabled have low transport probability.

5. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on destination: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability.

6. Missing expenditure data patterns: Multiple NaN values in expenditures indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower for Earth-origin passengers; missing Destination alone with expenditures present does not significantly reduce transport probability for Earth-origin.

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition.

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns, with ages 18-24 showing higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (<800).

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 40% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts.

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in a single amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 60% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations, except for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e.
