PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Children (Age â‰¤ 12) from Earth with zero expenditures across all amenities show elevated transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status
2. Passengers bound for TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending patterns (total 100-2000 credits) demonstrate higher transport likelihood than current thresholds indicate
3. Earth-origin passengers in G-deck cabins with zero expenditures show significantly higher transport rates compared to other cabin decks
4. VIP passengers with high FoodCourt expenditures (>5000 credits) maintain elevated transport probability despite overall spending levels
5. Passengers with missing CryoSleep data but zero expenditures across all amenities show transport patterns similar to CryoSleep-enabled passengers
6. Group members traveling to 55 Cancri e show stronger transport outcome correlation when accompanied by children under 5 years old
7. Intermediate age passengers (25-45) from Europa with Spa expenditures exceeding 500 credits demonstrate reduced transport probability
8. Passengers with single high-expenditure category (particularly FoodCourt >3000) while other categories remain low (<100) show elevated transport rates
9. Elderly passengers (Age >60) with any VRDeck expenditure show significantly lower transport probability regardless of other factors
10. Missing expenditure patterns where only one amenity shows spending while others are zero correlate with higher transport probability for Mars-origin passengers
