PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures across all amenities are highly likely to be transported, but this probability is significantly reduced for those bound for TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e and for age ranges 20-60.

2. Higher total spending correlates with lower transport probability, but this effect is attenuated for VIP passengers and for destinations TRAPPIST-1e and PSO J318.5-22.

3. Children (Age < 13) and elderly passengers (Age > 60) with CryoSleep enabled show elevated transport rates, except when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e or 55 Cancri e where the rate is moderate.

4. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate higher transport likelihood compared to other home planets, especially when combined with low spending or CryoSleep status.

5. Passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e have a higher baseline transport probability that is less affected by spending levels, while those bound for 55 Cancri e show more variability based on spending and age.

6. Cabin deck location (first letter of Cabin designation) shows stratification, with decks A, B, and C associated with higher transport probabilities for CryoSleep-enabled passengers.

7. VIP status reduces the negative impact of high spending on transport probability, making spending a weaker predictor for VIPs.

8. Group identifiers (numeric suffix in PassengerId) indicate that transport outcomes are often shared within groups, but individual factors like CryoSleep and spending can override group patterns.

9. Missing expenditure data patterns where some amenities have spending while others are missing or zero correlate with higher transport probability for passengers with CryoSleep disabled.

10. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show transport outcomes that are highly dependent on destination, with TRAPPIST-1e passengers having higher transport likelihood despite moderate spending.
