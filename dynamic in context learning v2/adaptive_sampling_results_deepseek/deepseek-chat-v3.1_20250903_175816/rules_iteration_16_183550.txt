PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport probability even with moderate total spending (>1600) if expenditures are broadly distributed across multiple amenities (<60% concentration in any single service)

2. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures across all amenities maintain high transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status or destination, overriding previous spending-based restrictions

3. Moderate-to-high spending thresholds for 55 Cancri e travelers are reduced: Non-VIP passengers show reduced transport probability above 1200 total spending, VIP passengers above 1800 total spending

4. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and missing expenditure data (NaN values) are treated as zero-spending cases for transport probability calculations across all destinations

5. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport probability when exhibiting concentrated spending patterns (>70% in any single amenity) regardless of total expenditure amount

6. Missing age values are contextually imputed based on expenditure patterns: Zero-spending passengers with missing age are treated as potential CryoSleep candidates with age-dependent transport probabilities

7. Group transport consistency rules are refined: Pairs with mixed age groups (adult+child) show >85% same-transport outcome when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, but more variable outcomes for 55 Cancri e destination

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport probability only when exhibiting both high total spending (>2000) and concentrated spending patterns (>65% in单一 amenity)

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 35% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts with similar spending patterns

10. Expenditure distribution patterns are further refined: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity only reduces transport probability when total spending exceeds 800, with Spa or VRDeck concentration having stronger negative correlation than other amenities

11. Passengers with multiple NaN expenditure values but non-zero values in other amenities are treated as partial spenders, with transport probability calculated based on observable spending patterns and destination-specific norms

12. Cabin deck G passengers show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e when accompanied by low-to-moderate spending (<600 total) and Earth origin, overriding previous destination-based restrictions

13. Age-dependent transport patterns for 55 Cancri e are refined: Children under 15 show increased transport probability regardless of spending, while adults 45+ show reduced probability only with total spending exceeding 1500

14. Missing HomePlanet data correlates with Mars-like transport patterns when accompanied by moderate spending and TRAPPIST-1e destination, but Europa-like patterns for high-spending 55 Cancri e travelers

15. Expenditure missingness patterns are destination-weighted: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers regardless of origin, but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with Earth origin
