PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 37
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep disabled but total expenditures below 2000 show increased transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly for Earth-origin passengers aged 18-40

2. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates even with moderate spending (500-1500 total) when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, overriding previous high-spending exclusion

3. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures show variable transport patterns based on destination: higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers, lower for 55 Cancri e travelers

4. Missing expenditure data patterns require destination-specific interpretation: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers regardless of origin planet

5. Cabin deck F passengers show universally higher transport probabilities to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending patterns or home planet

6. Moderate spending thresholds (500-2500) no longer automatically reduce transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

7. Passengers with concentrated spending in单一 amenity (exceeding 60% of total) maintain transport probability when total spending remains below 1500 for TRAPPIST-1e destinations

8. Age ranges 15-25 demonstrate elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending patterns when CryoSleep is disabled

9. VIP status modifies transport probability primarily for 55 Cancri e travelers, with minimal effect on TRAPPIST-1e transport outcomes

10. Group transport consistency extends to pairs traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, showing >85% same-transport outcome regardless of age composition

11. Mars-origin passengers with CryoSleep enabled maintain high transport probability regardless of destination or spending patterns

12. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show elevated transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers regardless of spending levels when CryoSleep is disabled

13. Missing age data correlates with higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e destinations across all home planets

14. Expenditure distribution patterns become less significant for transport prediction when total spending remains below 1000 for TRAPPIST-1e travelers

15. Cabin deck G passengers show stratified transport probabilities based on destination: elevated rates for TRAPPIST-1e travelers regardless of spending patterns
