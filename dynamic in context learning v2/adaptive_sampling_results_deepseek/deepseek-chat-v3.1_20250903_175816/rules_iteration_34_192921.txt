PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 34
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers from Earth traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with CryoSleep active and zero expenditures maintain high transport probability; however, those with any missing expenditure data under these conditions now show significantly reduced transport likelihood

2. Age-based transport patterns now show children (0-12) with any spending have near-zero transport probability, but infants (0-1) from Earth in CryoSleep with zero expenditures now show strong transport tendency regardless of destination

3. Earth-origin passengers with moderate total spending (300-1500) demonstrate consistently lower transport probability across all destinations, overriding previous elevated transport rates for Earth passengers

4. Cabin deck G passengers to all destinations except TRAPPIST-1e now show uniformly reduced transport probability, especially when combined with Earth origin and CryoSleep status

5. Missing expenditure data when combined with Earth origin now indicates significantly reduced transport probability across all destinations, with strongest negative correlation for TRAPPIST-1e routes

6. Single-amenity concentrated spending (particularly Spa >60% of total) now shows stronger negative correlation with transport probability, with thresholds lowered to 40% concentration for Earth-origin passengers

7. VIP status now reverses transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e: VIPs show increased transport likelihood while non-VIPs show decreased probability

8. Group transport consistency now extends to all group sizes: any passenger in groups of 2+ shows transport probability aligned with majority group outcome, overriding individual characteristics

9. Intermediate age range (25-45) Earth-origin passengers now show consistently reduced transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of spending patterns

10. Passengers with completely zero expenditures across all amenities now show destination-dependent transport probability: increased for Europa-origin, decreased for Earth-origin, neutral for Mars-origin

11. Missing age data combined with Earth origin and CryoSleep now indicates reduced transport probability, particularly for TRAPPIST-1e destination

12. Passengers from Mars with CryoSleep active and zero expenditures maintain high transport probability across all destinations without age-based exceptions

13. Any passenger with total expenditures exceeding 2500 now shows uniformly reduced transport probability regardless of VIP status or destination

14. Europa-origin passengers with missing expenditure data maintain elevated transport probability across all destinations, strongest for TRAPPIST-1e routes

15. Cabin deck F passengers show destination-stratified transport: increased for TRAPPIST-1e regardless of origin, decreased for 55 Cancri e regardless of origin
