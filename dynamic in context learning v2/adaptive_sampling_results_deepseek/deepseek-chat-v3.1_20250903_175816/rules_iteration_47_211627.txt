PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 47
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported, except for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e where transport probability is significantly reduced.
2. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures have high transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status, but this is moderately reduced for Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e.
3. For destination 55 Cancri e, passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures have high transport probability for ages under 30, and reduced probability for ages over 30.
4. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when accompanied by spending exceeding 1500 total or travel to 55 Cancri e; for TRAPPIST-1e with CryoSleep enabled, transport probability may be lower.
5. Moderate spending thresholds vary by VIP status and HomePlanet: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 500-2500 show reduced transport probability, but for Earth-origin, spending below 1500 does not reduce probability. VIP passengers require spending between 2000-5000 for reduced likelihood.
6. Cabin decks G and F show destination-dependent transport probabilities: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability, with additional variations for HomePlanet.
7. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with destination-specific transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers.
8. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition.
9. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low-moderate spending (<800), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending.
10. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 40% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts.
11. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in a single amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 60% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations.
