PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 22
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability, except when originating from Earth with non-55 Cancri e destinations where additional age verification applies (especially reduced transport for ages 25+)

2. Infants (age 0) with zero expenditures demonstrate elevated transport probability across all origins and destinations, overriding standard age-based filters

3. Earth-origin passengers traveling to PSO J318.5-22 show increased transport likelihood when total expenditures fall below 800, regardless of VIP status

4. Deck F passengers demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: higher transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (200-1500 total), but reduced probability to 55 Cancri e with any spending activity

5. Missing expenditure data interpretation varies by origin: Europa-origin passengers with 2+ NaN values show elevated transport probability, while Earth-origin passengers with any NaN values show reduced transport likelihood

6. Young adults (18-25) with low-to-moderate spending (100-1200 total) demonstrate elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly when originating from Mars or Europa

7. Moderate spending thresholds now incorporate destination adjustment: TRAPPIST-1e travelers show reduced transport probability above 1500 total spending, while 55 Cancri e travelers show reduced probability above 800 total spending

8. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Mars-origin passengers, where VIPs show 30% higher transport rates than non-VIP counterparts across all spending levels

9. Expenditure concentration threshold increased to 75% of total spending in单一 amenity before transport probability reduction applies

10. Cabin deck G passengers show stratified transport probabilities based on spending: higher transport rates with zero expenditures but significantly reduced probability with any spending activity above 50 total

11. Family groups with infants (age 0-1 members) demonstrate near-perfect transport consistency regardless of other factors, overriding individual passenger predictions

12. Intermediate age ranges (20-35) now show destination-dependent transport patterns: higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low spending (<500), but lower probability for PSO J318.5-22 travelers with any spending activity
