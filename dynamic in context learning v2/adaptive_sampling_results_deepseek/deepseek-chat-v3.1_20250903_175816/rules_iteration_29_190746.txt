PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 29
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers with total expenditures <800 maintain elevated transport probability even when exceeding zero spending, particularly for TRAPPIST-1e and PSO J318.5-22 destinations, except when showing concentrated Spa/VRDeck spending patterns

2. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures across all amenities show significantly increased transport probability regardless of destination, overriding previous spending-based restrictions for this age group

3. TRAPPIST-1e destination passengers with moderate total spending (500-2000) demonstrate higher transport rates than previously estimated, particularly for Earth and Mars origin passengers without concentrated spending patterns

4. Europa-origin passengers with high total spending (>3000) maintain substantial transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e when spending is distributed across multiple amenities rather than concentrated in单一 category

5. VIP status significantly increases transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e, reversing previous direction of effect, particularly for adults aged 25-50

6. Cabin deck G passengers show increased transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e when combined with Earth origin and zero expenditures, requiring adjustment to deck-based destination rules

7. Missing age data correlates with higher transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly when combined with low-moderate spending patterns (<1200 total)

8. Intermediate age range (30-50) demonstrates stronger transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e than previously estimated when combined with Mars origin and distributed moderate spending

9. Concentrated spending threshold revised upward: Only spending concentration exceeding 75% in单一 amenity reduces transport probability, with higher tolerance for VRDeck spending concentration

10. Group transport consistency extends to pairs with mixed age composition when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, with higher same-transport probability than previously estimated

11. Missing expenditure data combined with Earth origin indicates higher transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e, particularly when 3+ amenities show NaN values

12. Mars-origin children aged 0-5 with zero expenditures show near-certain transport probability regardless of destination, requiring exception to age-based spending rules
