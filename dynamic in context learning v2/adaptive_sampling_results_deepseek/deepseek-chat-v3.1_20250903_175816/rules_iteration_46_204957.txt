PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 46
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers in CryoSleep with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability, except when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e where transport likelihood decreases regardless of other factors.

2. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers, where VIPs show lower transport rates across all destinations compared to non-VIP counterparts.

3. Moderate spending thresholds (500-2500) reduce transport probability for non-VIP passengers uniformly across all home planets, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (3000-6000) to similarly reduce likelihood.

4. Passengers aged 0-18 with any expenditure activity show reduced transport probability across all destinations, with the effect strongest for Earth-origin travelers.

5. Cabin decks F and G show destination-dependent transport patterns: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain elevated transport rates, while Deck G passengers show reduced transport probability to 55 Cancri e.

6. Missing expenditure data patterns indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations.

7. Spending concentration in单一 amenity exceeding 70% of total expenditures correlates with reduced transport probability, particularly for Spa or VRDeck expenditures.

8. Intermediate age ranges (20-40) demonstrate destination-dependent patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low spending (<1000), but reduced probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending levels.

9. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size, but pairs with mixed age composition (particularly adult-child combinations) show reduced transport correlation compared to same-age pairs.

10. Earth-origin passengers with missing destination data show reduced transport probability regardless of spending patterns or CryoSleep status.

11. Passengers with zero expenditures across all amenities maintain high transport probability except when traveling to 55 Cancri e or when originating from Earth with missing destination data.

12. Cabin section (number suffix) interacts with deck letter: Higher-numbered cabins on decks F and G show reduced transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e destinations compared to lower-numbered cabins.

13. Age-spending interactions: Passengers under 25 with total expenditures exceeding 2000 show significantly reduced transport probability across all home planets and destinations.

14. Missing age data correlates with reduced transport probability for Earth-origin passengers but increased probability for Europa-origin passengers.

15. VIP status combined with Earth origin and TRAPPIST-1e destination shows the strongest negative correlation with transport probability among all demographic combinations.
