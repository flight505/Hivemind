PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 33
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures REMAIN highly likely transported EXCEPT when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22 where additional age and spending pattern filters apply (particularly lower transport probability for ages 0-18 and those in G deck cabins)

2. Moderate spending thresholds vary by VIP status AND destination: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 500-2500 show reduced transport probability to ALL destinations, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2000-5000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood, with additional penalties for TRAPPIST-1e travelers

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates EXCEPT when traveling to 55 Cancri e with ANY spending activity (>0 total) OR when showing concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa/VRDeck exceeding 50% of total spending)

4. Passengers aged 0-18 with ANY spending activity (≥1 across amenities) show significantly reduced transport probability REGARDLESS of CryoSleep status or destination, with strongest effect for ages 0-12

5. Cabin decks G and F show destination-stratified patterns: Deck F passengers maintain higher transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e, while Deck G passengers show reduced transport probability to ALL destinations when combined with any spending activity

6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with destination AND origin: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers, with Mars-origin passengers showing intermediate behavior

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size BUT shows exceptions: Groups of 3+ members maintain >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show destination-dependent variability requiring individual assessment based on age and spending patterns

8. Intermediate age ranges (18-45) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low-moderate spending (<800), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers REGARDLESS of spending, with PSO J318.5-22 showing age-dependent thresholds

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to ANY destination with moderate spending (500-2000), where VIPs show 25-40% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter MORE than total amount: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 50% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across ALL destinations and origins

11. Teenage passengers (13-19) with moderate spending (200-1500) show elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e but reduced probability to 55 Cancri e, requiring destination-specific assessment

12. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for Mars-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers across all destinations

13. Group size 2 passengers require individual assessment: Those with significant age difference (>15 years) or divergent spending patterns (>500 difference) show increased probability of split transport outcomes

14. Cabin deck T passengers show universally reduced transport probability regardless of other factors, particularly when combined with any spending activity

15. Passengers with completely missing cabin data BUT valid expenditure records show destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher probability for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e, intermediate for PSO J318.5-22
