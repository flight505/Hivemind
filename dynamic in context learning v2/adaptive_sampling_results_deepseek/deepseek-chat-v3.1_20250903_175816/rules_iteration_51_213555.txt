PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 51
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Young children (age 0-12) with zero expenditures show elevated transport probability when CryoSleep is active or missing, overriding normal age-based spending penalties

2. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate total spending (<1000) maintain higher transport probability, with spending thresholds adjusted upward for this specific route

3. Europa-origin passengers with high FoodCourt expenditures (>3000) demonstrate significantly increased transport probability regardless of other spending patterns

4. Missing CryoSleep data combined with zero expenditures across all amenities indicates high transport probability, particularly for Mars and Europa origins

5. VIP status reverses transport probability for Earth-origin passengers to 55 Cancri e, with VIPs showing increased transport likelihood compared to non-VIPs

6. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e maintain consistently high transport rates (>85%) regardless of spending patterns or age

7. Passengers with missing expenditure data across 3+ amenities show destination-dependent transport patterns: high probability for Europa origins, moderate for Mars, low for Earth

8. Group transport consistency extends to pairs (2 members) showing >80% same-transport outcome when both members share identical CryoSleep status

9. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e maintain high transport probability even with moderate spending (up to 1500 total)

10. Concentrated spending in ShoppingMall (exceeding 70% of total) correlates with increased transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e destination

11. Missing cabin data combined with zero expenditures indicates high transport probability for all destinations except 55 Cancri e

12. Children under 5 with any missing data fields (except expenditures) show elevated transport probability regardless of home planet
