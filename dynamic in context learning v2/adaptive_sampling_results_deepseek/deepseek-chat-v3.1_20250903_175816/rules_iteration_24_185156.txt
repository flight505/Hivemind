PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 24
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep enabled with zero expenditures results in high transport probability for destinations 55 Cancri e and PSO J318.5-22 across all ages, but for TRAPPIST-1e, transport probability is high only for children (age â‰¤12) and reduced for adults (age >12).

2. CryoSleep disabled passengers with moderate to high total expenditures (>500) show elevated transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e destination, especially in the 500-2500 range, while for 55 Cancri e, spending has minimal impact on transport likelihood.

3. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures have high transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status or destination.

4. Missing CryoSleep data (NaN) is handled based on expenditures: if zero, assume high transport probability similar to CryoSleep True; if >0, assume lower probability similar to CryoSleep False.

5. Earth-origin passengers maintain elevated transport rates, but for 55 Cancri e destination, VIP status reduces transport probability by approximately 40% compared to non-VIP.

6. Cabin deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with low spending (<800) have higher transport probability, while deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e with any spending show reduced transport probability.

7. Group transport consistency is strongest for families with children (age <18) and CryoSleep enabled, showing >90% same-transport outcome.

8. Concentrated spending in a single amenity exceeding 60% of total expenditures reduces transport probability generally, but this effect is less pronounced for TRAPPIST-1e travelers.

9. Missing age data (NaN) correlates with transport probability based on CryoSleep and spending: if CryoSleep True and zero spending, high probability; if CryoSleep False and spending >0, lower probability.

10. VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2000-5000) to reduce transport probability, but this is overridden for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e where VIP status inherently lowers probability.
