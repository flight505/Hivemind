PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures below 2500 maintain elevated transport probability, irrespective of spending distribution or age.
2. Europa-origin passengers with high total expenditures (>2000) demonstrate increased transport probability for destinations other than 55 Cancri e, where spending has minimal impact.
3. CryoSleep enabled with zero expenditures indicates high transport likelihood, except for Earth-origin adults (age 18+) on TRAPPIST-1e routes where probability is moderately reduced.
4. Missing CryoSleep status coupled with zero or minimal expenditures (total <100) correlates with high transport probability, mirroring CryoSleep-enabled behavior.
5. Concentrated spending in Spa or VRDeck (exceeding 60% of total) reduces transport probability universally, but concentration in FoodCourt or ShoppingMall does not reduce probability for Earth to TRAPPIST-1e.
6. Travel to 55 Cancri e for Earth-origin passengers does not inherently reduce transport; spending thresholds similar to TRAPPIST-1e apply, with moderate spending not diminishing probability.
7. Young adults (age 18-40) on Earth to TRAPPIST-1e with expenditures below 2500 have high transport probability, overriding concentration-based reductions.
8. VIP status elevates spending thresholds for reduced transport: Earth-origin VIPs require expenditures above 3000 on TRAPPIST-1e for probability reduction.
9. Missing expenditure data when CryoSleep is false suggests transport probability aligned with low-spending patterns, destination-dependent.
10. Single passengers or small groups (inferred from passenger ID patterns) with CryoSleep true and zero spending on Earth to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport probability if aged 18+.
