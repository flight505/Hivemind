PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 21
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Children aged 0-12 with zero expenditures show elevated transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, regardless of HomePlanet, contradicting previous child spending rules

2. PSO J318.5-22 destination requires separate treatment: Earth-origin passengers show higher transport rates even with moderate spending (up to 1500 total), unlike other destinations

3. VIP status moderates transport probability differently across destinations: VIPs to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (500-2000) show increased transport likelihood compared to non-VIP counterparts

4. Missing expenditure patterns vary by HomePlanet-destination combination: Earth-origin passengers with NaN values heading to TRAPPIST-1e show higher transport probability, while Europa-origin passengers with NaN values to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability

5. Cabin deck G passengers demonstrate destination-specific transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with zero spending, but reduced probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending

6. Intermediate age ranges (13-17) show distinct transport patterns: Higher transport probability when traveling with family groups to TRAPPIST-1e, but reduced probability when traveling alone to 55 Cancri e

7. Expenditure concentration thresholds vary by destination: For TRAPPIST-1e, concentrated spending in单一 amenity below 70% of total shows neutral transport effect, while for 55 Cancri e, any concentration above 50% reduces transport probability

8. Group transport consistency weakens for Earth-origin families traveling to 55 Cancri e, where individual age and spending factors override group transport patterns

9. Mars-origin passengers with missing CryoSleep data show higher transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with zero expenditures

10. Cabin side (P/S) modifies transport probability: Starboard side (S) shows slightly higher transport rates for Europa-origin passengers across all destinations
