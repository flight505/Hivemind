PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 40
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22 or when on cabin deck G, where transport probability is significantly reduced.

2. Moderate spending thresholds vary by destination: For TRAPPIST-1e, non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 1000-3500 show reduced transport probability, while VIP passengers require spending between 2500-5000 to similarly reduce transport likelihood. For other destinations, thresholds are lower (500-2500 for non-VIP, 2000-5000 for VIP).

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates for TRAPPIST-1e even with total spending up to 2000, and for 55 Cancri e with age above 12 years, maintaining high probability.

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity (â‰¥1 across amenities) show significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status or destination.

5. Cabin decks G and F show destination-dependent transport probabilities: Deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e and PSO J318.5-22 have reduced transport probability, while Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have elevated transport rates.

6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers and passengers with missing HomePlanet, but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers.

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show variable patterns dependent on age composition and destination.

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with spending below 1000, but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers with spending above 500.

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 40% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts.

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in a single amenity (exceeding 60% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations except TRAPPIST-1e, where it has minimal impact.
