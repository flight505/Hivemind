PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are generally transported, except children and teens (age <18) without spending have reduced transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

2. Adjust Earth-origin transport probabilities: Those with moderate spending (500-1500 total) demonstrate higher transport rates when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, while maintaining reduced probability for high spenders (>1500) to all destinations

3. Children aged 0-12 show increased transport probability when in CryoSleep with zero expenditures, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e where transport rates remain low regardless of spending

4. Refine missing expenditure patterns: Multiple NaN values combined with Earth origin indicate higher transport probability, while single amenity NaN values with actual spending in other categories reduce transport likelihood

5. Cabin deck F passengers show elevated transport rates across all destinations when combined with CryoSleep status, while deck G passengers maintain reduced rates except when traveling with Europa origin

6. Intermediate age ranges (18-30) demonstrate higher transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with low-moderate spending (<1000), particularly for non-VIP passengers

7. VIP status significantly increases transport probability for Earth-origin passengers with any spending activity when traveling to 55 Cancri e, reversing previous pattern

8. Spending concentration patterns: VRDeck spending exceeding 40% of total expenditures correlates with increased transport probability for Europa-origin passengers across all destinations

9. Groups of 2+ members show strong transport consistency when all members have identical CryoSleep status, regardless of age composition

10. Passengers with no recorded expenditures but missing CryoSleep data show destination-dependent patterns: higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e

11. Earth-origin passengers aged 13-17 with any spending activity show reduced transport probability, except when traveling to PSO J318.5-22 with CryoSleep enabled

12. Moderate Spa spending (200-800) combined with low other expenditures (<200) increases transport probability for all planetary origins when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e

13. Missing age data combined with zero expenditures indicates higher transport probability for Europa and Mars origins, but lower probability for Earth origin passengers
