PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 62
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures traveling to 55 Cancri e should maintain high transport probability regardless of age (children under 13 not excluded from transport)

2. Earth-origin passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures and no CryoSleep show increased transport probability when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e and PSO J318.5-22

3. VIP passengers with moderate total expenditures (500-2000) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate significantly reduced transport probability compared to non-VIP counterparts

4. Mars-origin passengers aged 18-30 with low-moderate spending (100-800 total) show elevated transport probability to TRAPPIST-1e regardless of CryoSleep status

5. Cabin deck B passengers demonstrate universally higher transport probabilities across all destinations when CryoSleep is enabled and expenditures are zero

6. Passengers with completely missing expenditure data (all amenities NaN) show destination-dependent transport patterns: higher probability for Europa-origin to TRAPPIST-1e, lower for Earth-origin to 55 Cancri e

7. Intermediate age ranges (30-50) with concentrated Spa or VRDeck spending (>70% of total) show reduced transport probability only when traveling to 55 Cancri e

8. Group transport consistency strengthens for mixed-age groups (adults+children) traveling together, showing >85% same-transport outcome regardless of spending patterns

9. Missing age data combined with zero expenditures correlates with higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers across all destinations

10. Earth-origin passengers aged 13-25 with any VRDeck spending (>0) show reduced transport probability when traveling to 55 Cancri e, regardless of CryoSleep status

11. Passengers with total expenditures between 1000-3000 demonstrate destination-polarized outcomes: higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e, lower for 55 Cancri e

12. Cabin deck G passengers with zero expenditures show uniformly high transport probability across all destinations and age groups when CryoSleep is enabled

13. Missing VIP status data combined with high FoodCourt spending (>2000) indicates reduced transport probability for Mars-origin passengers to all destinations

14. Passengers aged 60+ with any RoomService spending demonstrate consistently low transport probability regardless of destination or origin planet

15. Family groups with children under 5 show near-perfect transport consistency (95%+ same outcome) when traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with zero expenditures
