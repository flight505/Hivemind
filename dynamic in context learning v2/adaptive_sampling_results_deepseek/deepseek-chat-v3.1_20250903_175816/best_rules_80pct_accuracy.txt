IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures remain highly likely transported, except when traveling to 55 Cancri e where additional age-based filters apply (particularly lower transport probability for children under 13)

2. Moderate spending thresholds vary by VIP status: Non-VIP passengers with total expenditures between 500-2500 show reduced transport probability, while VIP passengers require higher spending thresholds (2000-5000) to similarly reduce transport likelihood

3. Earth-origin passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates except when accompanied by high spending patterns (>1500 total) or travel to 55 Cancri e destination

4. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity (≥1 across amenities) show significantly reduced transport probability regardless of CryoSleep status

5. Cabin decks G and F show stratified transport probabilities based on destination: Deck F passengers to TRAPPIST-1e have higher transport rates, while Deck G passengers to 55 Cancri e show reduced transport probability

6. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with destination-specific transport outcomes: Multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability for Europa-origin passengers but lower probability for Earth-origin passengers

7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size: Groups of 3+ members show >90% same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition

8. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) demonstrate destination-dependent transport patterns: Higher transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e travelers with low-moderate spending (<800), but lower probability for 55 Cancri e travelers regardless of spending

9. VIP status modifies transport probability most significantly for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, where VIPs show 40% lower transport rates than non-VIP counterparts

10. Expenditure distribution patterns matter: Concentrated spending in单一 amenity (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 60% of total spending) correlates with reduced transport probability across all destinations
