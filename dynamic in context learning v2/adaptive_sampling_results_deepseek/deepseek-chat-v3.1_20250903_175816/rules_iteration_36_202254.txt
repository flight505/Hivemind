PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 36
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with total expenditures below 900 across all amenities show significantly higher transport probability (approximately 85%) regardless of age or cabin assignment

2. VIP status modifies transport probability thresholds for all destinations: VIP passengers with zero expenditures maintain high transport probability (>90%) while non-VIP passengers require destination-specific expenditure thresholds (TRAPPIST-1e: <900, 55 Cancri e: <300, PSO J318.5-22: <200) for elevated transport likelihood

3. Children aged 0-12 with exactly zero expenditures across all amenities show high transport probability (>80%) when traveling with family groups, overriding previous spending-based child transport rules

4. Cabin deck F passengers demonstrate elevated transport rates to TRAPPIST-1e (75% transport probability) while cabin deck G passengers show reduced transport probability to 55 Cancri e (25% transport probability) regardless of expenditure patterns

5. Missing expenditure data patterns combined with Earth origin indicate higher transport probability (70%) for TRAPPIST-1e destination but lower probability (30%) for 55 Cancri e destination

6. Passengers with concentrated spending in单一 amenity exceeding 75% of total expenditures show reduced transport probability across all destinations, with strongest effect for Spa/VRDeck spending concentration

7. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with moderate spending (200-800 total) maintain 65% transport probability, while same age range to 55 Cancri e shows only 35% transport probability regardless of spending

8. Group transport consistency extends to pairs when both passengers are under age 18, showing >85% same-transport outcome with higher probability of both being transported

9. Europa-origin passengers with high total expenditures (>2500) maintain moderate transport probability (60%) to TRAPPIST-1e but show significantly reduced transport probability (20%) to 55 Cancri e

10. Passengers with completely missing cabin data but verifiable expenditure patterns show destination-dependent transport outcomes: higher for TRAPPIST-1e (70%) and lower for 55 Cancri e (25%)
