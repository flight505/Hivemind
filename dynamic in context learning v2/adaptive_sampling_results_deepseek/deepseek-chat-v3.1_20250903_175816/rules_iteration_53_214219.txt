PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 53
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with CryoSleep enabled and zero expenditures are highly likely transported, except when destination is TRAPPIST-1e or PSO J318.5-22, where transport probability is reduced by 20-30% regardless of age.

2. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e with any total expenditure above 300 show significantly reduced transport probability, while for other destinations, the threshold is 1500 for reduced probability.

3. Infants aged 0-1 with CryoSleep disabled have very low transport probability (<10%) due to dependency issues, overriding other factors.

4. Missing CryoSleep data is treated as False for expenditure-based rules, and missing expenditures are imputed as 0 for transport calculations.

5. VIP status on TRAPPIST-1e: VIPs with spending above 2500 have moderately increased transport probability, while non-VIPs with spending above 500 have reduced probability.

6. Cabin deck F and G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with spending above 500 show reduced transport probability, reversing previous deck-based advantages.

7. Groups including children under 13: if any group member has spending activity, overall transport probability decreases by 15-25%.

8. Age range 25-45 on TRAPPIST-1e: transport probability decreases linearly with spending above 400, with steeper reduction for expenditures exceeding 1000.

9. Expenditure concentration: if over 70% of total spending is in Spa or VRDeck, transport probability is reduced by 20% across all destinations.

10. Passengers with multiple missing values (â‰¥3 NaN in amenities) have lower transport probability if HomePlanet is Earth, but higher if HomePlanet is Europa, based on destination patterns.
