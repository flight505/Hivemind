PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 27
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. CryoSleep-enabled passengers with zero expenditures show consistently high transport probability across all destinations, with no age-based exceptions for TRAPPIST-1e travelers

2. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e demonstrate elevated transport rates regardless of spending levels, with spending thresholds only reducing transport probability for other destinations

3. Passengers aged 0-12 with any spending activity maintain transport probability comparable to other age groups when CryoSleep is disabled

4. Cabin decks F and G passengers show uniform transport patterns across all destinations, with no destination-specific stratification

5. Missing expenditure data patterns correlate with higher transport probability universally, regardless of origin planet

6. Intermediate age ranges (25-45) show consistent transport patterns across all destinations, with spending thresholds applying uniformly

7. VIP status modifies transport probability consistently across all origin-destination combinations, not just Earth to 55 Cancri e

8. Concentrated spending in single amenities (particularly Spa or VRDeck exceeding 60% of total) correlates with elevated transport probability rather than reduced

9. Passengers with total expenditures between 500-2500 show increased transport probability regardless of VIP status

10. Group transport consistency applies equally to pairs and larger groups, with no age composition dependencies

11. All passengers with completely zero expenditures (across all amenities) show high transport probability regardless of other factors

12. Missing age data correlates with reduced transport probability across all demographic segments

13. Mars-origin passengers demonstrate transport patterns consistent with Earth-origin passengers when controlling for other factors

14. Cabin side (P/S) shows stronger transport pattern differentiation than deck level, with Starboard side having consistently higher transport rates

15. Passengers with any missing expenditure data points (NaN values) show transport probability patterns consistent with zero-spending passengers
