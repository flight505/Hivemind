PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 35
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. Passengers with zero expenditures are highly likely transported, with reduced probability for destination 55 Cancri e for ages 1-12, and for Earth-origin to TRAPPIST-1e for ages over 45.
2. Earth-origin passengers have elevated transport rates for destinations other than TRAPPIST-1e and 55 Cancri e, but for TRAPPIST-1e, transport probability is reduced when spending exceeds 500 for non-VIP passengers.
3. For intermediate age ranges (25-45), transport probability for TRAPPIST-1e is higher with spending below 800 for non-Earth origins, but for Earth-origin, probability is lower with any spending for TRAPPIST-1e.
4. Passengers aged 0-12 with zero expenditures have high transport probability, while with any spending, probability is reduced regardless of CryoSleep status.
5. Cabin deck G passengers to TRAPPIST-1e show reduced transport probability when spending is present, especially for Earth-origin passengers.
6. Missing expenditure data patterns: for Europa-origin, multiple NaN values indicate higher transport probability, but for Earth-origin, lower probability for TRAPPIST-1e destination.
7. Group transport consistency strengthens with family size; groups of 3+ members show high same-transport outcome, while pairs show more variable patterns dependent on age composition.
8. VIP status reduces transport probability for Earth-origin passengers traveling to 55 Cancri e, with VIPs showing lower rates compared to non-VIPs.
9. Total spending above 2000 for non-VIP passengers reduces transport probability for most destinations, but for Europa-origin, probability may not be reduced.
10. CryoSleep status has minimal impact on transport probability when expenditures are zero; both enabled and disabled with zero spending have high transport probability with exceptions based on destination and age.
