FEEDBACK:
✅ PASSED STAGE 1: 55.0/70 ≥ 55
STAGE 1 EVALUATION:
STAGE 1 SCORES:  
RUBRIC 1: 6 - Three suggestions (Inkling Inventor, Verdant Venture, Symbio Story Weaver) show strong originality with novel twists like LLM-moderated marketplaces or symbiotic educational narratives; two (EchoEcho, HabitForge) are moderately innovative but borrow from existing concepts (e.g., debate simulators like Kialo or AI habit coaches like Replika), lacking fully groundbreaking integrations and edging on common LLM debate/ personalization tropes.  
RUBRIC 2: 7 - Three suggestions are straightforward LLM API calls with minimal extras (e.g., EchoEcho, HabitForge, Symbio); two involve moderate complexity like API integrations (patent/USPTO for Inkling, vision/weather APIs for Verdant) that could extend MVP to 2-3 weeks and raise costs slightly beyond $100/month, though still feasible for a small team without custom ML.  
RUBRIC 3: 8 - Four suggestions leverage advanced techniques like multi-agent orchestration, chained prompting, and iterative loops effectively (e.g., EchoEcho's bias-audited agents, Verdant's vision chaining); one (HabitForge) uses solid but more standard sentiment-based chaining without deeper novelty like true reinforcement learning, missing some LLM-specific enhancements.  
RUBRIC 4: 8 - Four suggestions provide clear, quantifiable value for underserved needs (e.g., Inkling's 50% prototyping speedup for solopreneurs, Symbio's 35% literacy boost); one (Verdant Venture) offers solid niche utility for urban foragers but with less broad appeal and somewhat unsubstantiated grocery savings claims.  
RUBRIC 5: 9 - All five span unrelated domains (social debate, personal wellness, invention, urban sustainability, education) with distinct mechanics and audiences; minor thematic link in personalization across two but executed differently without functional overlap.  
RUBRIC 6: 8 - Four suggestions proactively mitigate risks with bias audits, multi-LLM fallbacks, and privacy controls (e.g., GDPR compliance, ephemeral data); one (Inkling Inventor) addresses IP and fairness well but glosses over potential marketplace negotiation hallucinations without explicit user verification steps.
