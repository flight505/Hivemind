Quality Score: 87.0/100
Goal: list of 5 totally unique and useful suggestions for a new simple saas using LLMs

FEEDBACK:
✅ PASSED STAGE 1: 57.0/70 ≥ 55
STAGE 1 EVALUATION:
STAGE 1 SCORES:  
RUBRIC 1: 6 - Three suggestions (e.g., community planner, wardrobe optimizer) show strong originality with niche twists like harmony indices or speculative agents; two (therapy journal and mentorship match) are moderately innovative but borrow from known LLM apps like AI therapy bots (Woebot) or virtual tutors (Duolingo AI), lacking fully groundbreaking mechanics and edging on derivative role-playing tropes.  
RUBRIC 2: 7 - Three suggestions are straightforward (e.g., basic uploads and prompts for journaling or planning); two involve moderate complexity (e.g., multi-agent simulations and lightweight RL in networking tool, or vision APIs in wardrobe app), feasible for a solo dev with Zapier/OpenAI but bloating MVP timeline beyond 1 week and risking API costs without ultra-simplicity.  
RUBRIC 3: 9 - Four suggestions innovate deeply with advanced techniques like multi-agent chaining, probabilistic forecasting, and few-shot from datasets; one (wardrobe optimizer) uses solid but more standard iterative prompting with image APIs, missing slightly more unique LLM-specific depth like full reinforcement mechanics.  
RUBRIC 4: 8 - Four suggestions offer high, quantifiable utility for underserved needs (e.g., 30-50% improvements in waste/skill/community metrics with logical backing); one (networking tool) provides solid but narrower professional value, with benefits feeling somewhat inflated by cited surveys without deeper personalization evidence.  
RUBRIC 5: 9 - Four suggestions span unrelated domains (e.g., sustainability, mental health, agriculture, career skills) with distinct mechanics and audiences; one (mentorship and networking) has minor thematic overlap in professional development simulations, though executions differ enough to avoid full redundancy.  
RUBRIC 6: 8 - Four suggestions incorporate solid mitigations (e.g., bias audits, ephemeral storage, fallbacks, user flags); one (therapy journal) addresses key ethical risks like overreach but glosses over potential emotional harm from unverified empathetic outputs, with generic GDPR mentions not fully proving 95% reliability.  
RUBRIC 7: 10 - All five descriptions are clear, complete, and professional, covering users, workflows, LLM integrations, monetization, benefits, and risks in concise 130+ word formats without ambiguity or omissions, enabling easy prototyping.
