1. If (A > 85 or B > 85) and C < 40 and (A * B) > (C * D * E) and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
2. If A < 35 and B < 20 and (D / (A + B)) > 4 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 2 and E < 45, then output is 3
3. If (A > 80 or D > 75) and B < 40 and C < 40 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.4 and (A * D) > (B * C) * 3, then output is 4
4. If A > 90 and B < 20 and C < 25 and D > 80 and E > 75 and (A + D) < (B + C + E) * 1.5, then output is 2
5. If B < 15 and C > 40 and D > 55 and E < 15 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 3 and (D / A) > 2.5, then output is 3
