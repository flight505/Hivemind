PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 39
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If E > 70 and (A + B + C + D) < (E * 2.5), then output is 3
2. If C > 75 and E < 5 and (A + B + D) < (C * 1.5), then output is 3
3. If D > 85 and (A + B + C + E) < (D * 2), then output is 3
4. If A > 75 and B < 25 and C < 25 and E < 25 and (A / (B + C + E)) > 3, then output is 3
5. If A > 85 and B < 10 and (A / B) > 10, then output is 4
6. If B > 85 and A < 20 and (B / A) > 5, then output is 4
7. If D > 90 and E > 60 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.5, then output is 4
8. If A > 75 and D > 75 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.5, then output is 4
9. If B > 45 and C > 45 and D > 45 and E > 45 and (B + C + D + E) > (A * 3), then output is 4
10. If A > 95 and D > 70 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 2, then output is 4
11. If A > 80 and B < 5 and C > 75 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 2, then output is 4
12. If A > 70 and 30 < E < 50 and (A / E) > 1.5, then output is 2
13. If B < 10 and C < 10 and E > 50 and (E / (B + C)) > 5, then output is 2
14. If A > 80 and E < 15 and (A / E) > 6, then output is 2
15. If A < 10 and E > 80 and (E / A) > 10, then output is 2
16. If C > 95 and A < 15 and B < 25 and (C / (A + B)) > 5, then output is 3
17. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 75 and D < 10 and E < 10 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 20, then output is 1
18. If D > 90 and E > 90 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 2, then output is 1
19. If B > 90 and D > 75 and E > 90 and C < 15 and (B + D + E) > (A + C) * 4, then output is 1
20. If D > 75 and E > 90 and C < 25 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.5, then output is 2
