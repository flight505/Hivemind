PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 78
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C < 10 and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 2
2. If E > 75 and A < 30 and D < 50, then output is 4
3. If A > 75 and E < 35 and (B < 30 or D < 50), then output is 4
4. If D > 85 and C > 80 and A >= 40 and A <= 60 and E < 65, then output is 1
5. If B >= 40 and B <= 70 and C >= 40 and C <= 70 and D >= 40 and D <= 70 and E >= 30 and E <= 60 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then output is 3
6. If D < 20 and E < 20 and (B + C) > 100, then output is 2
7. If A < 20 and D < 20 and B > 90 and C > 90 and E > 70, then output is 2
8. If A > 85 and E > 90 and B > 65 and C > 65, then output is 1
9. If B > 70 and C > 75 and E > 85 and D < 35, then output is 3
10. If A > 75 and C > 85 and E < 20, then output is 2
