PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 47
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 45 and B > 45 and C > 45 and D > 45 and E > 90, then output is 1
2. If C > 80 and D > 85 and (C + D) > (A + B + E), then output is 4
3. If (A + C) > 160 and (B + D + E) < 150, then output is 1
4. If A < 10 and C > 85 and D < 60 and E < 55, then output is 3
5. If A > 85 and E > 90 and B < 50, then output is 1
6. If A > 70 and B > 70 and C > 70 and D > 70 and E < 40, then output is 2
7. If D > 70 and E > 85 and A < 30, then output is 4
8. If A < 5 and D < 10 and E > 60, then output is 2
9. If A < 30 and C < 20 and E > 50, then output is 3
10. If D < 20 and (A + C + E) > 150 and A > 50, then output is 2
11. If A < 20 and B > 75 and C < 25 and (D - E) > 40, then output is 3
12. If (A - B) < -10 and (D / B) > 1.2 and (E / C) < 1.2, then output is 2
