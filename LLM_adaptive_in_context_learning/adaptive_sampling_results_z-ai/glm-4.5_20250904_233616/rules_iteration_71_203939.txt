============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A < 20 and C > 90 and ((A + D) < (C + E) * 0.8), then output is 3
2. If B > 90 and D > 70 and E > 80 and A < 50 and C < 60, then output is 1
3. If B < 15 and C > 90 and D < 15 and E > 40, then output is 2
4. If A < 25 and E > 75 and (E / (A + 1)) > 6 and (D + B) < 120, then output is 4
5. If C > 90 and D < 25 and (A + B + E) > (C + D) * 0.8, then output is 2
6. If (A > 80 or C > 85) and B < 40 and D < 20 and E > 50, then output is 2
7. If B < 10 and A < 30 and D > 40 and E > 35, then output is 3
8. If C < 5 and E < 15 and A > 60 and D > 75, then output is 1
9. If B > 90 and C < 40 and A < 30 and E > 65, then output is 1
10. If A > 80 and B > 60 and C > 70 and D < 30 and E > 90, then output is 1
11. If A < 15 and B > 75 and C > 85 and D > 55 and E < 20, then output is 3
