============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 75 and (A + B) > (C + D) * 1.2 and (A / B) < 1.5 and D < 70 and (E <= 80 or (A + C) >= 100), then output is 1
2. If C > 85 and D > 65 and E > 75 and A < 30, then output is 1
3. If B > 70 and C > 70 and D > 90 and E > 40, then output is 3
4. If (B > 85 and D < 25) or (A > 60 and D > 80 and E < 10), then output is 2
5. If B > 60 and E > 80 and (A + C) < 100, then output is 2
6. If D > 80 and E < 10 and B > 40, then output is 2
7. If A > 55 and D < 50 and E >= 40 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.1, then output is 2
8. If (A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 50 and D < 50) or (C > 90 and D > 70 and E < 25), then output is 2
9. If A < 15 and B > 90 and D > 60 and E < 25 and not (D > 90 and C > 40), then output is 2
10. If A > 85 and D < 20 and E < 10, then output is 2
11. If B > 80 and D < 15 and E < 25, then output is 2
12. If (B > 90 and A < 10) or (C > 70 and D > 70) or (C > 60 and D > 80 and E < 10 and B <= 40), then output is 3
13. If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) and (A + D) > (B + C), then output is 3
14. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 200 and A < 40 and E < 25, then output is 3
15. If (B + C + E) < 30 or (C > 80 and D < 25 and E < 10), then output is 3
16. If A < 20 and D > 90 and C > 65, then output is 3
17. If B > 80 and C > 60, then output is 4
18. If A > 80 and B < 10, then output is 4
19. If C > 85 and E > 90 and D < 25, then output is 4
20. If A > 70 and D > 65, then output is 4
21. If E > 75 and D > 30 and (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
22. If (B < 15 or C > 75) and D > 60 and E > 50, then output is 4
