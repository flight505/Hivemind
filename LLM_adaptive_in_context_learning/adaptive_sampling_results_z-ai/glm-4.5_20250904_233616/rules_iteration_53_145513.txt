============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A < 10 and B > 70 and (C + D + E) < (B + A) * 0.9, then output is 3
2. If |A - D| < 10 and B < 35 and C < 15 and E < 30, then output is 4
3. If A > 75 and B > 75 and C < 30 and D > 75 and E < 50, then output is 1
4. If A < 70 and B < 30 and C > 85 and D > 85 and E < 10, then output is 1
5. If A < 10 and B > 60 and C < 20 and D < 20 and E > 70, then output is 3
6. If B < 10 and C > 80 and 80 < (D + E) < 130, then output is 4
7. If A > 70 and B > 70 and C > 70 and D > 70 and E < 50, then output is 4
8. If A < 10 and B > 80 and E > 70 and (C + D) < 90, then output is 3
9. If B < 10 and D > 90 and (A + C + E) < 100, then output is 3
10. If B > 60 and (A + C + D + E) < 100, then output is 4
11. If B < 10 and E < 10 and (A + C + D) > 80, then output is 3
12. If A < 5 and D < 20 and C > 65 and E > 70, then output is 3
13. If |A - D| < 20 and |B - C| < 20 and E < 40 and D > E, then output is 4
