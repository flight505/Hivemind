IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 90 and D > 85 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 and (A + B + C) > (D + E), then output is 1
2. If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 and ((A > 70 and D > 90) or (B > 70 and C > 90) or (C > 70 and D > 60 and E > 65)), then output is 4
3. If D > 70 and ((C < 10 and E < 10) or (C > 95 and D > 98)) and (B > 60 or A > 70), then output is 1

6. If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.8 and E < 25 and (B + C) > (A + D), then output is 3
7. If E > 75 and A < 40 and B < 15 and C < 25 and D < 60, then output is 2
