PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 60
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 75 and C < 15 and (A/E) > 2 and (A+C) > (B+D+E), then output is 1
2. If C > 90 and D < 10 and E < 15 and C > (A+B+D+E) * 2, then output is 2
3. If E > 85 and C > 45 and (E/C) > 1.5 and (E+D) > (A+B+C), then output is 4
4. If A < 20 and B < 35 and C < 15 and D > 60 and E > 45 and (D+E) > (A+B+C) * 3, then output is 4
5. If A < 15 and B < 25 and C < 5 and D > 35 and E > 85 and (E/A) > 6, then output is 3
6. If (B > 90 and A < 10 and B > (A+C+D+E)) or (B > 95 and (B/A) > 5) or (E < 8 and C > 35 and C > (A+B+E)) or (A > 95 and D > 90 and E < 25 and A > (B+C+E)), then output is 3
7. If A > 90 and B > 80 and C > 5 and D < 70 and E < 70 and A > (B+C+D+E), then output is 1
8. If A < 25 and B > 80 and C < 15 and D > 50 and E > 55 and B > (A+C+D+E), then output is 1
9. If A < 20 and B > 50 and C > 75 and D > 65 and E > 85 and (C+D+E) > (A+B) * 5, then output is 4
10. If A < 30 and B < 40 and C < 5 and D > 70 and E > 70 and (D+E) > (A+B+C) * 8, then output is 4
11. If A > 40 and B > 70 and C < 5 and D > 50 and E > 50 and (B+D+E) > (A+C) * 5, then output is 1
12. If (A < 10 and B > 90 and C > 90 and D > 50 and E > 40) or (A > 95 and B > 80 and D > 90), then output is 3
