PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 70
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A > 75 or C > 85) and D > 35 and E > 45 and (A + B + E) > 180, then output is 1
2. If (A > 80 and D > 80) or (B > 85 and D > 75) and C < 70, then output is 1
3. If E > 35 and (A + B + D) < 180 and C > 20 and (A + B) > (C + D), then output is 2
4. If B > 70 and E / B > 0.7 and C < 55 and D < 70 and (A + D) < 150, then output is 2
5. If E < 15 and (B + C) > (A + D) and A < 35 and D > 20, then output is 3
6. If E < 10 and (A + C) > (D + E) and (B + C) > 60 and D > 20, then output is 3
7. If D > 70 and E < 25 and (B < 40 or A > 75) and (A + C) > 50, then output is 4
8. If B < 10 and D > 45 and E < 65 and (A + C) > 30, then output is 4
