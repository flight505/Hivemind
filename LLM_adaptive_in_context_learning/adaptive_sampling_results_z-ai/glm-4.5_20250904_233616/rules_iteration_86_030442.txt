PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 86
============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 75 and (A + B + D) > (C + E) * 2 and C < 40, then output is 1
2. If A > 80 and E < 25 and (A / E) > 4, then output is 1
3. If E > 70 and E > (A + B + C + D) / 2 and at least one of A, B, C is less than 30, then output is 4
4. If (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.15 and B < 15, then output is 4
5. If C > 60 and at least two of A, B, D, E are less than 30 and (A + B + D + E) < 100, then output is 2
6. If A > 90 and C < 40 and D < 30 and E < 60, then output is 1
7. If max(A, B, C, D, E) = E and E > C > 40 and C > A and C > B and C > D, then output is 2
8. If C > 70 and E > 60 and (C + E) > (A + B + D) * 1.5, then output is 4
9. If A > 80 and E > 70 and B < 30 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.1, then output is 1
10. If D > 75 and B < 20 and (D / B) > 5, then output is 4
11. If (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.2 and A > 55 and D > 40, then output is 4
12. If B > 75 and D > 90 and C < 20 and E > 65, then output is 2
13. If A > 70 and C < 15 and E < 20 and D < 40, then output is 2
14. If A > 75 and B > 70 and C < 15 and E > 80, then output is 1
