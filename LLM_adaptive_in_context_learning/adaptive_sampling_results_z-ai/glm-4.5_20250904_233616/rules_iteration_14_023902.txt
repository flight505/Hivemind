IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If D > 70 and B > 70 and (A > 50 or E > 60) and (C + E) > (A + B) * 0.8, then output is 1
2. If E > 60 and D < 40 and (A < 50 or C > 40) and (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 1.5, then output is 4
3. If A < 25 and E < 20 and B > 70 and C > 70 and (A * E * D) < (B * C) * 0.1, then output is 3
4. If B > 75 and E < 10 and ((A + D) > 50 or (C + D) > 50) and (B / E) > 10, then output is 2
5. If E > 45 and D < 30 and (A > 40 or B > 40) and (E / D) > 2.5 and (A * C) > (B * D) * 0.5, then output is 2
6. If D > 90 and B > 80 and E > 85 and (A + C) > 40, then output is 1
7. If E > 75 and D < 35 and C > 35 and (A + B) < 150, then output is 4
8. If A > 55 and E > 90 and B > 50 and D > 60, then output is 1
9. If B > 90 and C > 60 and D > 30 and E > 70 and A < 20, then output is 4
10. If D < 15 and E > 50 and (A + B) > 70 and C > 25, then output is 2
11. If D > 95 and E > 80 and (A + B) > 120 and C < 50, then output is 1
12. If (B + C) < 15 and D > 55 and E > 75 and (A + D) > (B + C + E), then output is 2
13. If E > 65 and D < 25 and (A + B) < 100 and C > 35, then output is 4
14. If A > 85 and D > 90 and E > 90 and (B - C) < 30, then output is 1
15. If C > 90 and D < 25 and B < 40 and E > 60, then output is 4
