============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If D > ((A + B + C + E) / 1.8) and (A + B + E) < 200, then output is 4
2. If (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.1 and A > 65 and B > 50 and E > 25, then output is 1
3. If E > (A + B + C + D) / 2.5 and E > 70 and max(A,B,C,D) < E, then output is 3
4. If A > 70 and (B + C) < (A / 1.5) and D > 30 and E > 20, then output is 2
5. If B > 60 and D > 60 and E < 25 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 1.3, then output is 3
6. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 150 and E > 20 and max(A,B,C,D) < 40, then output is 2
7. If (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.2 and A > 55 and D > 60 and C < 35, then output is 2
8. If A > 55 and B > 45 and C > 40 and E > 45 and D < 40, then output is 1
9. If D > 60 and A < 50 and B < 50 and C < 50 and E > 15, then output is 1
10. If B > 70 and D > 70 and (A + C) < E and E < 30, then output is 3
11. If A < 15 and B > 85 and C > 75 and D < 30 and E > 30, then output is 3
12. If C < 10 and E > 75 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.3, then output is 2
13. If B < 15 and E > 30 and (E / B) > 5 and (E / D) > 2, then output is 2
14. If D > 60 and B > 75 and (D + B) > (A + C + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
15. If C > 85 and E < 10 and (C / E) > 10, then output is 3
16. If (A > 85 or C > 85) and E < 35 and ((A > 85 and (A / E) > 3) or (C > 85 and D > 65 and E > 65)), then output is 1
17. If A < 15 and B > 85 and C > 85 and D > 85 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 4, then output is 1
18. If D > 65 and E > 55 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.1, then output is 4
19. If A > 70 and B > 85 and D > 85 and C < 25, then output is 1
20. If A < 20 and B > 75 and C < 20 and D < 20 and E > 45, then output is 2
