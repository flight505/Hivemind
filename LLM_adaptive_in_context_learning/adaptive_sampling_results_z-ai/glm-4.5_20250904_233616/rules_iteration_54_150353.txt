============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C > 70 and E > 65 and ((A < 80 or B < 70) or (A + C) < (B + D + E)) and (E / B) > 1.5 and (C / E) < 1.5, then output is 1
2. If D > 35 and A < 30 and E < 35 and (D / (A + E)) > 2.5 and (D / B) > 1.2 and (D / C) > 1 and (B + C + E) < (D) * 2, then output is 3
3. If E > 70 and B < 35 and (E / (A + B + C + D)) > 0.4 and (E - D) > 15 and (E - C) > 10, then output is 4
4. If D > 75 and E < 15 and (D / E) > 7 and A > 70 and B > 50 and C < 40 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.5, then output is 4
5. If A > 75 and B > 75 and D < 50 and E < 10 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.5 and (C / E) < 10, then output is 1
6. If A > 90 and C > 70 and B < 45 and E < 15 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 2.5 and (D / A) < 0.8, then output is 2
7. If C > 65 and D > 65 and (A < 20 or A > 85) and B < 50 and E < 50 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.5 and (A + B) < (C + D), then output is 4
8. If A < 15 and B > 75 and C > 65 and D > 80 and E < 40 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 15 and (C / A) > 5, then output is 3
9. If A < 10 and B > 70 and C > 80 and D > 90 and E < 25 and (D / A) > 12 and (B + C) < (D) * 1.5 and (E / B) < 0.4, then output is 3
