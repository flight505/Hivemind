============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A < 15 and B > 85 and E > 85 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 2.5, then output is 1
2. If A < 20 and D < 20 and E > 60 and C > 30, then output is 3
3. If B > 80 and B > max(A, C, D, E) * 1.2 and (A + C + D + E) < 300, then output is 4
4. If A > 90 and B < 20 and D < 20, then output is 2
5. If A < 25 and E < 25 and B > 75 and C > 75 and D > 75, then output is 3
6. If A > 70 and C > 70 and E > 70 and B < 30 and D < 30, then output is 1
7. If A > 90 and B < 10 and E < 10 and C > 40 and D > 40, then output is 4
8. If C < 25 and E < 25 and A > 40 and B > 50 and D > 60, then output is 2
9. If E > max(A, B, C, D) * 1.3 and E > 60, then output is 4
10. If A < 30 and C < 30 and E < 30 and D > max(A, B, C, E) * 1.5, then output is 3
11. If A < 30 and E < 30 and B > 75 and D > 75, then output is 3
12. If B < 10 and E < 10 and (A + C + D) > 100, then output is 3
13. If A > 60 and C < 10 and D > 50 and B < 60, then output is 2
14. If D > 90 and C < 30 and E < 30 and A > 40, then output is 1
15. If C < 20 and A > 60 and B > 60 and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 1
