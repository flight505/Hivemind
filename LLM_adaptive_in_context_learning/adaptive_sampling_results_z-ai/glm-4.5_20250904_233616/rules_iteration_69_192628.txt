IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If E > 90 and A < 10 and E > (B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 4
2. If B > 95 and D > 95 and C < 10 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 2, then output is 1
3. If A > 85 and C < 30 and A > (B + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
4. If C > 80 and B < 5 and C > (A + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 4
5. If C > 85 and E < 5 and C > (A + B + D) * 2, then output is 2
6. If C > 90 and A < 40 and B < 40 and D < 40 and E < 40, then output is 3
7. If E > 65 and B < 10 and E > (A + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 4
8. If B > 60 and C > 60 and D > 60 and E > 60 and A < 10, then output is 1
9. If E > 90 and C < 10 and E > (A + B + D) * 2, then output is 2
10. If D > 75 and B < 25 and D > (A + C + E) * 1.3, then output is 4
11. If B > 85 and E > 85 and D < 35 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 2, then output is 1
12. If A > 55 and B > 55 and D < 10 and E < 10 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 2, then output is 1
