============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 55 and (A + B) > (C + D) and (A / B) < 1.5 and D < 70, then output is 1
2. If B > 70 and C > 70 and D > 90 and E > 40, then output is 1
3. If B > 80 and D < 25 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
4. If A > 55 and D < 50 and E >= 40 and (A + E) > (B + C + D), then output is 2
5. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 50 and D < 50 and E < 45, then output is 2
