PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 97
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (D+E)/(A+B+C) < 0.45 and E > 10 and A > 40, then output is 1
2. If (A > 70 and D < 15 and E > 75 and B > 20 and C > 20), then output is 1
3. If (A < 25 and B > 90 and D > 80 and E > 90 and C > 40), then output is 1
4. If (C+E)/(A+B+D) > 5 and A < 15 and (E/C) < 2 and D > 5, then output is 2
5. If (E > 90 and (A + B + C + D) < 200 and B > 5 and C > 5), then output is 2
6. If (A+C)/(B+D+E) < 0.1 and E > 40 and D > 5 and B > 15, then output is 3
7. If (A < 30 and B > 70 and C > 50 and D > 40 and E < 25), then output is 3
8. If (A < 15 and C > 30 and D < 40 and E > 20 and B > 10), then output is 3
9. If (A/(A+B+C+D+E) > 0.40 and B < 15 and D > 40 and C > 20), then output is 4
10. If (D/(A+B+C+E) > 0.40 and E < 30 and A > 60 and B > 50 and C > 30), then output is 4
11. If (E/(A+B+C+D) > 0.50 and C > 65 and D > 30 and A > 20 and B > 20), then output is 4
