============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 60 and E < 30 and D < 70 and (A / E) > 2.5, then output is 1
2. If C > 50 and D > 25 and (C + D) > (A + B + E), then output is 3
3. If E > 45 and D > 20 and (D + E) > (A + B + C), then output is 4
4. If A > 75 and B > 50 and C > 80 and D < 20 and E < 10, then output is 1
5. If (C + E) < 30 and B > 70 and D > 60, then output is 2
6. If D > 65 and B > 50 and (D + B) > (A + C + E), then output is 4
7. If A > 50 and B > 70 and C > 75 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
8. If A < 25 and B > 50 and D > 65 and (B + D) > (A + C + E), then output is 3
9. If A > 90 and C > 90 and E > 85 and B < 25, then output is 2
