============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 50 and C < 60 and E < 50 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
2. If (max(A, B) > 70 and min(A, B) < 25) and E > 15 and (max(A, B) + E) > (min(A, B) + C + D) * 0.8, then output is 2
3. If D > 60 and E < 30 and C > 45 and (D + E) > (A + B) * 0.7, then output is 3
4. If (C > 55 and D > 65) or ((C + D) > (A + B) * 1.2 and (E > 10 or E < 10)) or (C > 70 and D > 40), then output is 4
5. If (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.1 and C > 65 and D < 90, then output is 3
6. If ((A > 65 and B < 30) or (A < 30 and B > 65)) and E > 20 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 0.9, then output is 2
7. If (D + E) > (A + B + C) and C > 40 and E > 50, then output is 4
8. If B > 55 and (A - B) < 20 and (A + B) > (C + D) and C < 40, then output is 1
