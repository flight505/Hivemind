============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 80 and E < 15 and (A / E) > 6, then output is 1
2. If E > 65 and C > 60 and A < 40 and (E / A) > 1.5, then output is 4
3. If A > 60 and C > 55 and D < 25 and (A + C) > (D + E) * 2, then output is 4
4. If B > 90 and E > 75 and A < 50 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
5. If A > 85 and D > 85 and E > 95 and C < 10 and (A + D + E) > (B + C) * 10, then output is 1
6. If D > 60 and E > 60 and A < 10 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 3, then output is 3
7. If B > 50 and C > 50 and D > 50 and E < 10 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 5, then output is 3
8. If A > 80 and D > 80 and C < 5 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 2, then output is 2
9. If A > 75 and C > 75 and E < 5 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 3, then output is 1
10. If A > 50 and C > 50 and D > 50 and E > 50 and (A + C + D + E) > (B) * 5, then output is 4
11. If D > 70 and E > 45 and A < 50 and B < 50 and C < 50 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.5, then output is 4
