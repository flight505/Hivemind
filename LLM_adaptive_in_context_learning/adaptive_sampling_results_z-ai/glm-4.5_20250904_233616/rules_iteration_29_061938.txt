PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 29
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 70 and E > 70 and C < (A + E) / 2.5 and (A + E) > (B + C + D), then output is 1
2. If B > 80 and C > 80 and E < 50 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 1.1, then output is 3
3. If (A > 65 or B > 80) and D > 70 and E < 30 and (A + B + D) > (C + E) * 2, then output is 4
4. If 30 <= A <= 55 and 15 <= B <= 45 and 40 <= C <= 75 and 15 <= D <= 35 and (A + B + E) < (C + D), then output is 3
5. If A > 60 and B > 60 and C < 10 and D > 70 and E < 20 and (A + B + D) > (C + E) * 6, then output is 1
6. If A < 35 and B < 35 and C > 70 and D > 55 and E > 45 and (C + D + E) > (A + B) * 3, then output is 4
7. If A > 85 and E < 20 and (B + C + D) < 180 and (A + B + C + D) < (A + E) * 2, then output is 2
8. If B > 80 and E > 75 and (A + C + D) < (B + E) and (B + E) > (A + C + D + E) / 2, then output is 1
9. If A > 60 and B < 35 and C > 65 and D < 25 and E > 75 and (C * E) > (A * B * D), then output is 2
10. If C < 15 and E < 30 and D > 70 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.5, then output is 4
11. If A < 20 and B > 75 and C > 75 and D > 55 and E > 45 and (B + C) > (A + D + E), then output is 3
12. If B < 30 and C > 80 and D > 70 and E > 65 and (C + D) > (A + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
13. If A > 70 and C < 30 and D < 30 and E > 50 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.8, then output is 1
