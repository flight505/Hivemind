============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 80 and C < 15 and E > 25 and (A / C) > 2.5, then output is 2
2. If A > 90 and E < 30 and (A / E) > 6 and B < 50, then output is 2
3. If B > 85 and E > 55 and C < 10 and (B / C) > 9 and (E / C) > 5, then output is 1
4. If A > 85 and B > 85 and C > 95 and D > 95 and E < 50 and (A + B + C + D) > (E * 9), then output is 3
5. If A > 85 and B > 85 and C < 5 and D > 85 and E < 40, then output is 1
6. If A > 95 and E > 95 and B > 70 and C > 60 and D > 50 and (A + E) > (B + C + D), then output is 1
7. If A < 50 and C > 70 and D > 85 and E > 60 and (C + D) > (A + E), then output is 4
8. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 120 and (A + C + E) < 75 and (B + D + E) < 70, then output is 4
9. If C > 75 and D < 20 and E < 20 and A < 50 and B < 65 and (C / (D + E)) > 3, then output is 2
10. If C > 85 and D > 80 and E > 85 and A < 40 and B < 40 and (C + D + E) > (A + B) * 6, then output is 1
11. If E > 95 and A < 10 and B < 30 and C < 45 and D < 45 and (E / (A + B + C + D)) > 0.7, then output is 4
12. If B > 90 and C > 90 and D > 80 and A > 60 and E < 15 and (B + C) > (D + E) * 2, then output is 3
13. If A > 70 and B < 20 and C < 10 and D > 65 and E > 50 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 2, then output is 4
14. If D > 95 and A > 60 and E > 65 and B < 55 and C < 20 and (D / (B + C)) > 2, then output is 2
15. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 250 and (A + C + E) < 160 and (B + D) < 85 and min(A, B, C, D, E) > 25 and max(A, B, C, D, E) < 70, then output is 4
