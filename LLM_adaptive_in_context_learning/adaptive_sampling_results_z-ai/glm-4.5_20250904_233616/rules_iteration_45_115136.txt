IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 65 and D < 40 and (A + B) * 1.2 > (C + D + E), then output is 1
2. If A > 80 and C < 60 and D < 65 and E < 55, then output is 1
3. If A > 65 and B > 65 and D < 15 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.8, then output is 1
4. If B < 20 and C < 40 and E > 60, then output is 2
5. If B > 75 and C > 75 and D < 25 and E < 50, then output is 2
6. If B > 80 and C > 80 and D > 80 and A < 40 and E < 30, then output is 3
7. If B < 30 and (A + C + D + E) > 200 and (A + C + D + E) / B > 20, then output is 4
