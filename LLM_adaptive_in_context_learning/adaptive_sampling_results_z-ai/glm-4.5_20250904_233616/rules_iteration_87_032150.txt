============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 85 and C < 10 and D > 70 and E > 80 and (A + D + E) > (B + C) * 3, then output is 1
2. If D < 15 and E > 30 and (E / D) > 3 and (A + B + C) > (E * 2) and (A + B) < (D + E), then output is 2
3. If A > 70 and B < 20 and C < 5 and D > 50 and E < 45 and (A / (B + C)) > 5, then output is 4
4. If E > A and E > B and E > C and E > D and 30 < A + B + C + D < 200 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then output is 2
5. If A > 80 and B < 10 and (C / B) > 10 and C > 80 and D < (A + C) * 0.2, then output is 1
6. If D > 70 and B > 70 and C > 40 and (A + B + D) > (C + E) * 1.5 and A > 35, then output is 4
7. If B > 70 and C > 85 and D > 70 and E > 65 and 35 < A < 65 and (B + C) > (A + D + E), then output is 3
8. If A < 25 and B > 90 and D < 15 and (B - (A + D)) > 60 and C > 25, then output is 2
9. If C > 95 and E > 95 and A < 60 and D < 55 and (C + E) > (A + B + D) * 1.4, then output is 1
10. If A > 60 and B > 70 and C < 20 and D > 40 and E > 50 and (A + B) > (C + D + E), then output is 1
11. If A < 25 and D < 15 and B > 75 and E > 70 and (A + D) < (B + E)/2 and C > 40, then output is 2
12. If A > 65 and B < 5 and (A / B) > 70 and (C + D + E) < (A * 2) and (C + D + E) > 50, then output is 4
13. If A > 85 and (B + C + E) > 150 and (A / D) > 1.8 and (A + B + C + E) > D * 5, then output is 1
14. If B > 95 and (A + D + E) > 200 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) and C < 50, then output is 1
15. If A > 85 and B < 10 and D > 75 and E > 95 and (C / B) > 8 and C > 60, then output is 1
