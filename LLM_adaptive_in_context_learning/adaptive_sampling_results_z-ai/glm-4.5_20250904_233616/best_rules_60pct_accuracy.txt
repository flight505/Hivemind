PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A + B) > (C + D + E) and A > 60 and E < 40, then output is 1
2. If A > max(B, C, D, E) - 20 and E < min(A, B, C, D) + 10 and C < 50, then output is 1
3. If (A - E) > 50 and (A + B) > (C + D) and B > 30, then output is 1
4. If (A/B) > 5 and D < 50 and E < 75, then output is 2
5. If B < 20 and A > 70 and (C + D) < 100, then output is 2
6. If A > 80 and B < 15 and (D - E) < 30, then output is 2
7. If A < min(B, C, D, E) + 10 and E > 40 and E < 60, then output is 3
8. If (A + C) < (D + E) and (B + E) > (A + D), then output is 3
9. If A < 30 and E > 45 and (A + B + C) < (D + E), then output is 3
10. If (D + E) > (A + B + C) and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 4
11. If D > 70 and E > 70 and C > 50, then output is 4
12. If (D + E + C) > (A + B) * 2 and D > 65 and E > 50, then output is 4
