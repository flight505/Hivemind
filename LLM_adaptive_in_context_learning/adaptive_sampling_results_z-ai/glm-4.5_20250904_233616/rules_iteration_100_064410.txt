PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 100
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If D > 90 and E > 90 and C < 20 and (A + E) < (B + C + D), then output is 1
2. If A < 40 and E < 25 and C > 60 and D > 60 and B < 20, then output is 3
3. If E < 5 and C < 20 and D < 10 and (A / B) > 3, then output is 3
4. If B > 90 and A < 30 and C < 50 and E < 25, then output is 3
5. If A < 30 and C > 90 and D < 30 and (C / A) > 3, then output is 3
6. If B > 80 and A < 30 and C < 50 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
7. If A > 75 and B < 50 and C < 10 and D < 15 and E < 20 and (A / (B + C + D + E)) > 2, then output is 1
8. If E > 90 and A < 15 and B < 50 and C < 40 and D < 20, then output is 3
9. If A > 60 and C > 60 and D < 15 and E < 45 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 2
10. If A > 80 and C > 90 and D > 60 and E < 15, then output is 2
11. If A > 80 and B < 15 and D < 15 and E > 50 and (A / B) > 5, then output is 2
12. If A > 50 and C > 85 and D > 60 and E < 20 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.5, then output is 2
