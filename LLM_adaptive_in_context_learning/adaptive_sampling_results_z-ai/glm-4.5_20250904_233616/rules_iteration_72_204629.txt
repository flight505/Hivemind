PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 72
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 60 and C > 60 and E > 60 and (A + C + E) > (B + D) * 2 and (A + C + E) / (B + D) > 2.5, then output is 1
2. If D > 55 and D > (A + B + C + E) / 3 and D / ((A + B + C + E) / 4) > 1.8, then output is 3
3. If E > 45 and (A + B + C) < E * 2 and E / ((A + B + C + D) / 4) > 1.7, then output is 3
4. If A > 60 and D > 60 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.1 and (A + D) / (B + C + E) > 1.3, then output is 4
5. If B > 70 and (A + C + D) < B * 1.5 and B / ((A + C + D + E) / 4) > 1.6, then output is 2
6. If C > 50 and E > 50 and (C + E) > (A + B + D) * 1.1 and (C + E) / (A + B + D) > 1.4, then output is 4
7. If A < 35 and E < 35 and (B + C + D) / (A + E) > 3, then output is 3
8. If (A + B) < 60 and (C + D + E) / (A + B) > 3, then output is 4
9. If (C + D) / (A + B + E) > 1.5 and C > 30 and D > 30, then output is 2
10. If (A + E) / (B + C + D) > 1.5 and A > 50 and E > 50, then output is 2
11. If (B + C) > 120 and (D + E) < 60 and A < 40 and B > C, then output is 2
12. If (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.4 and A > 60 and D > 60 and E < 30, then output is 3
13. If A < 30 and D > 80 and (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 0.6, then output is 3
14. If B < 20 and C > 50 and D < 30 and E > 70 and C / (A + B + D) > 3, then output is 3
15. If A > 80 and B < 15 and D < 20 and E > 70 and (A + E) / (B + C + D) > 4, then output is 1
