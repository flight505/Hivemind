============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If E > 60 and B > 60 and (E / D) > 2 and (A + B + E) > (C + D) * 1.3, then output is 1
2. If C > 85 and E > 50 and A > 75 and (C / D) > 1.5, then output is 1
3. If B > 90 and D > 80 and E > 90 and (B + D + E) > (A + C) * 1.5, then output is 1
4. If B > 90 and E > 80 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 1.2, then output is 1
5. If A > 90 and B < 60 and C > 95 and E > 95, then output is 2
6. If A > 75 and B < 35 and C > 60 and E > 30 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.1, then output is 2
7. If A > 90 and C > 90 and E > 50 and (A / B) > 2, then output is 2
8. If A < 25 and C > 55 and D > 15 and (C + D) > (A + B + E), then output is 3
9. If B > 95 and C > 90 and D > 85 and E < 60 and A < 70 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 4, then output is 3
10. If A < 10 and C > 65 and E > 70 and C > D * 3, then output is 3
11. If B < 35 and C > 45 and D > 25 and E > 28 and (D + E) > (A + C) * 0.8, then output is 4
12. If B < 20 and C > 75 and D > 45 and E > 45 and (B + C + E) > (A + D), then output is 4
13. If B < 35 and C > 50 and (D + E) > (A + B) and C > E, then output is 4
