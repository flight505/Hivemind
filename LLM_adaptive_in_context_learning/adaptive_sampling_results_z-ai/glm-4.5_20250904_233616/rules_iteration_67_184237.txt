============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 80 and B > (A + C + D + E) * 0.35 and D > 40, then output is 4
2. If A > 85 and A > (B + C) * 1.4 and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 1
3. If A > 65 and B > 65 and C > 65 and (D + E) < (A + B + C) * 0.4, then output is 1
4. If C > 80 and B < 30 and D > 50 and (C / B) > 3, then output is 4
5. If A > 65 and E > 65 and B > 70 and C < 20 and D < 20 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
6. If B > 85 and E < 10 and (B / E) > 10 and D > 50, then output is 4
7. If E > 80 and A < 20 and D < 10 and (E / (A + D)) > 8, then output is 3
8. If A > 90 and C > 80 and B < 50 and E < 50 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
9. If D > 80 and E > 80 and C < 35 and A > 70 and (D + E) > (A + B + C), then output is 2
10. If A > 75 and B > 60 and C < 40 and D > 75 and E > 80, then output is 1
11. If A > 65 and B > 65 and C > 75 and E > 90 and D < 45, then output is 1
12. If A > 80 and B > 70 and C > 75 and E < 25 and D > 50, then output is 2
13. If A > 85 and B < 10 and C < 30 and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 4
14. If A > 95 and C < 20 and D > 40 and E > 40 and A > (B + C + D + E) * 0.35, then output is 1
15. If C > 85 and A < 40 and B < 40 and D > 60 and E > 40, then output is 3
16. If D > 90 and C > 70 and A < 40 and B < 65 and E > 35, then output is 3
