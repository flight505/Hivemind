============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 85 and (B > 70 or C > 80) and D < 60 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
2. If E > 70 and (A < 20 or B < 15 or C < 10) and (B + C) < (A + D) * 0.8 and (A * B * C) < (D * E) * 0.5, then output is 2
3. If D > 45 and D < 80 and A > 20 and A < 60 and B > 15 and B < 40 and C > 30 and C < 50 and E > 20 and E < 60 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then output is 3
4. If D > 60 and (B < 25 or C < 15) and E < 35 and D > (A + B + E) * 0.7, then output is 4
5. If A > 80 and B > 80 and (C + D) < (A + B) * 0.7 and E < (A + B) * 0.4, then output is 1
6. If (A < 10 and B < 5 and C < 15) and E > 70 and E > (A + B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 3
7. If D > 65 and C > 70 and E < 30 and (C * D) / (A + B + E) > 2, then output is 4
8. If A > 70 and C > 85 and D < 25 and (A + E) < (C) * 1.5, then output is 1
9. If B > 90 and C < 15 and D > 50 and E < 15 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 2, then output is 2
10. If A > 90 and B < 30 and C < 40 and D < 55 and E < 40 and (A) > (B + C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
