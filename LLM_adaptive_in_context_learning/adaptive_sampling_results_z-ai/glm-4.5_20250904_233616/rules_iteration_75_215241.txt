PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 75
============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If D > 90 and E > 50 and ((A + B + C) < (D + E) * 0.8), then output is 4
2. If C > 80 and D > 50 and E < 30 and (C / E) > 4 and (A + B) < 150, then output is 4
3. If A < 10 and B > 80 and E > 40 and (B / A) > 15 and (A + C + D) < (B + E) * 0.7, then output is 2
4. If A < 40 and B > 75 and C > 75 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 1.4, then output is 4
5. If B > 95 and E < 30 and (B / E) > 4 and (A + C + D) < (B * 1.5), then output is 1
6. If B < 10 and E > 90 and (E / B) > 15 and (A + C + D) < (E * 2), then output is 2
7. If A > 75 and C > 75 and D < 10 and ((A + C) / (B + E)) > 2, then output is 1
8. If A < 10 and E > 70 and C < 20 and (E / A) > 15 and (E / C) > 4, then output is 3
9. If A < 30 and D > 90 and E > 35 and E < 45 and (D / A) > 5 and (D / E) > 2, then output is 3
10. If A > 75 and B < 20 and D < 20 and E > 45 and (A / B) > 6 and (A / D) > 5, then output is 2
