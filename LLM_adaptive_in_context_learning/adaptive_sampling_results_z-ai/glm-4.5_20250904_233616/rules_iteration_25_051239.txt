PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 25
============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 80 and E < 25 and (A/E) > 4 and (B+C+D) < 200 and A > (B+C+D+E) / 3, then output is 1
2. If B > 90 and C < 30 and (A+D+E) < 150 and (B/(C+1)) > 5 and B > (A+C+D+E) / 2, then output is 1
3. If C > 75 and D < 20 and E < 20 and (C/(D+E+0.1)) > 2 and C > (A+B+D+E) / 2, then output is 2
4. If A > 80 and B > 70 and D > 90 and E < 30 and (A+B+D) > (C+E) * 4 and (A+B+D) > 250, then output is 4
5. If A > 60 and C > 70 and B < 30 and D < 20 and (A+C) > (B+D+E) * 2 and A+C > B+D+E+100, then output is 4
6. If A < 20 and B > 80 and C > 80 and (B+C) > (A+D+E) * 2.5 and (B+C) > 160 and D < 80, then output is 3
7. If A > 80 and B > 70 and C > 50 and D < 30 and (A+B+C) > (D+E) * 4 and (A+B+C) > 200, then output is 1
8. If A > 60 and B > 60 and C > 60 and D > 60 and E > 60 and (A+B+C+D+E) > 350 and (A*B*C*D*E)^(1/5) < 80, then output is 3
9. If A < 10 and B > 70 and (B/A) > 10 and C < 40 and D < 40 and E < 40 and (B*C*D*E) < 1000000, then output is 3
10. If A < 15 and E < 15 and C > 60 and D > 70 and (C+D) > (A+B+E) * 2.5 and (C*D) > (A*B*E) * 10, then output is 3
11. If E > 60 and A < 50 and B < 30 and C < 40 and D < 50 and E > (A+B+C+D) and (E/(A+B+C+D)) > 1.5, then output is 4
12. If A < 30 and B < 30 and C > 75 and D > 60 and E > 50 and (C+D) > (A+B) * 2.5 and (C*D) > (A*B*E) * 2, then output is 4
