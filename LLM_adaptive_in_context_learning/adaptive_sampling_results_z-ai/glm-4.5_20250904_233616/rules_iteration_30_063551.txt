PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 85 and B > 85 and C < 50 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.3, then output is 1
2. If D > 70 and (D > A and D > B) and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 0.8 and (A + B + C + E) < 250, then output is 4
3. If E > 60 and D > 35 and E > D and (E + D) > (A + B + C) * 1.2, then output is 4
4. If A > 90 and B < 10 and (A / B) > 10 and C > 60 and D > 70, then output is 1
5. If A > 80 and (B + C + D) < 60 and E > 40 and (A / E) < 2, then output is 2
6. If A > 90 and B > 65 and C > 90 and D < 35 and E < 25 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 4, then output is 2
7. If B > 75 and C > 70 and D > 70 and E > 80 and A < 55 and (B + C + D + E) > (A + B + C + D + E) * 0.85, then output is 1
8. If (A > 75 and B > 85) and D > 90 and E > 80 and (A / E) < 1, then output is 1
9. If B > 80 and C < 15 and D < 25 and (A + B + E) > 150 and (B / (A + C + D + E)) > 0.5, then output is 2
10. If D > 70 and E > 70 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.3, then output is 4
11. If A > 60 and B < 35 and C > 45 and D < 45 and E < 45 and (A > B and A > D and A > E), then output is 4
12. If A > 95 and B > 80 and C > 40 and D > 45 and E > 40 and (A / B) < 1.3 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
