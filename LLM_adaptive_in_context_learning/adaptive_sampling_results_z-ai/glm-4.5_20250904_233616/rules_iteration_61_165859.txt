============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A < 15 and B > 80 and D < 15 and E < 35 and (B / (A + D)) > 10, then output is 3
2. If A > 70 and D > 70 and E < 20 and C < 75 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
3. If A > 75 and B < 35 and D > 70 and (A / B) > 2.5 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 1.3, then output is 2
4. If A < 20 and C > 90 and D > 80 and (A * E) < 1500 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 2, then output is 3
5. If A > 65 and B > 60 and C > 65 and D > 75 and E > 55 and max(A, B, C, D, E) < 95 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 350, then output is 1
6. If A > 75 and E > 75 and B > 40 and B < 80 and C > 25 and C < 45 and D > 70 and (A * E) > 6000 and (A + D) > (B + C) * 2, then output is 1
7. If B > 65 and C > 65 and E > 70 and A > 50 and A < 60 and D > 55 and D < 65 and (B + C + E) > (A + D) * 2.5, then output is 4
8. If D > 60 and E < 10 and A > 50 and A < 60 and B > 30 and B < 40 and C > 30 and C < 40 and (D / E) > 8, then output is 3
9. If A < 15 and B > 15 and C < 15 and D < 15 and E < 25 and (A + C + D) < 40, then output is 2
10. If C > 70 and D > 60 and A < 40 and E < 15 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 2.5, then output is 3
11. If A > 80 and E > 70 and B < 25 and D < 10 and (A / (B + D)) > 10 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 2, then output is 2
