============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 65 and E > 65 and C < 30, then output is 1
2. If A < 20 and B < 15 and E > 45, then output is 2
3. If A < 15 and C > 85 and E < 20, then output is 3
4. If B > 90 and C < 40 and E < 40 and (A + E) < (B + D), then output is 1
5. If A < 15 and C > 90 and D < 5 and E < 15, then output is 3
6. If B < 15 and E > 90 and C < 20, then output is 2
7. If A < 25 and B > 80 and C > 90 and D < 60, then output is 3
8. If A < 15 and B > 70 and C < 5 and E > 50, then output is 3
9. If A > 85 and D < 50 and E < 25 and (A / E) > 3.5, then output is 1
10. If C > 95 and B > 85 and E > 80, then output is 3
11. If A > 60 and C < 20 and D < 15 and E > 30, then output is 1
12. If A > 50 and B > 50 and C < 30 and D < 25 and E < 10, then output is 2
13. If A > 85 and B < 50 and D > 75 and E > 85, then output is 1
14. If E < 10 and D > 50 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
15. If B > 85 and C > 75 and D < 25 and E > 80, then output is 1
