============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 85 and (D / A) < 0.6 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.1 and C < (A / 2) and E < (A / 2), then output is 1
2. If A < 15 and E > 65 and (A + D) < (C + E) * 0.5 and (E / B) > 2 and (E / (A + B + C)) > 1.5, then output is 4
3. If C > 85 and D > 85 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.8 and E < 50 and (A + E) < C, then output is 3
4. If A > 80 and B > 75 and (C + E) < (A + B) / 5 and (A / C) > 8 and (B / E) > 8 and D < (A + B) / 3, then output is 1
5. If A < 5 and B < 10 and E > 70 and (E / (A + B)) > 10 and (C + D) < E and (A + B + C) < (D * 0.8), then output is 3
6. If A > 60 and C > 90 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.2 and (A / B) > 2 and (C / D) > 1.5 and (C / E) > 1.5, then output is 1
7. If A < 30 and B < 65 and C < 35 and D < 15 and E < 20 and B > A and C > D and E < B, then output is 2
8. If A > 45 and B > 45 and C < 20 and D > 90 and E < 35 and D > (A + B + C + E) and B > E, then output is 2
9. If A < 40 and B > 95 and C > 75 and D < 65 and E < 10 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 2.5, then output is 4
10. If A < 20 and B < 20 and C < 15 and D < 30 and E > 50 and (A + B + C + D) < E, then output is 2
