============================================================


IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 75 and C > 65 and D > 60 and E > 30 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.1, then output is 1
2. If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 and A > 80 and B > 60 and C > 70 and D > 70 and E > 80, then output is 1
3. If A > 75 and C > 80 and D > 65 and E > 50 and (A + C) > (B + D) * 1.2, then output is 1
4. If B > 75 and D < 30 and (A + C + E) < 120, then output is 2
5. If B < 20 and (A / B) > 7 and C < 30 and D < 50 and E < 30, then output is 2
6. If A < 15 and D > 70 and E > 50 and C > 40 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 2, then output is 3
7. If D > 60 and E < 20 and (D / E) > 4 and (A + B + C) < 150, then output is 3
8. If C < 30 and A < 35 and D > 50 and E < 25, then output is 3
9. If A > 75 and B < 20 and (A / B) > 5 and D > 35, then output is 4
10. If D > 90 and E < 20 and (D / E) > 5, then output is 4
11. If A > 90 and B < 35 and D > 70 and C < 40 and E < 35, then output is 4
