IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If B > 55 and (A + B) > (C + D) and (A / B) < 1.5 and D < 70, then output is 1
2. If B > 70 and C > 70 and D > 90 and E > 40, then output is 1
3. If B > 80 and D < 25 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 1
4. If A > 55 and D < 50 and E >= 40 and (A + E) > (B + C + D), then output is 2
5. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 50 and D < 50 and E < 45, then output is 2
6. If A < 15 and B > 90 and D > 60 and E < 25, then output is 2
7. If A > 60 and C > 80 and D > 60 and E > 40 and (A + B) < (C + D), then output is 2
8. If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) and (A + D) > (B + C), then output is 3
9. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 200 and A < 40 and E < 25 and (A + B) < (C + D + E), then output is 3
10. If C > 70 and D > 90 and A < 30 and B < 10 and E > 45, then output is 3
11. If E < 10 and D > 35 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
12. If E > 75 and D > 30 and (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
13. If C > 90 and D > 20 and (A + B) < (C + D + E), then output is 4
