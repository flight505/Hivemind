============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 65 and B > 80 and C < 50 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
2. If A < 30 and B < 30 and D > 90 and E > 90 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 2.5, then output is 4
3. If B > 95 and C > 95 and D > 90 and A < 30 and (B + C + D) > 280, then output is 3
4. If A > 85 and E < 25 and (A / E) > 4 and C > 50, then output is 2
5. If A > 70 and C < 20 and D > 70 and E < 25, then output is 1
6. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 250 and (A + B) < (C + D) and E < 35, then output is 3
7. If A > 50 and B < 30 and C > 70 and D < 35 and E > 35, then output is 4
8. If A > 65 and B < 25 and C < 30 and E > 70 and (E / B) > 3, then output is 4
9. If A < 35 and B > 70 and C > 90 and D < 15 and E > 40, then output is 1
10. If 60 < A < 70 and 25 < B < 35 and 40 < C < 45 and 40 < D < 45 and E > 30, then output is 4
