IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C > 80 and E < 35 and B > 70 and (D < 15 or D > 70), then output is 1
2. If A > 60 and D > 80 and B + C < 80 and (E > 70 or E < 20), then output is 3
3. If B > 75 and C > 75 and E < 25 and (D < 15 or D < E / 2), then output is 1
4. If A < 20 and C < 15 and B > 65 and E > 50 and D < 50, then output is 2
5. If A < 5 and D < 5 and E > 40 and B > 60 and C < 70, then output is 3
6. If A > 60 and B > 55 and C < 40 and E > 35 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 1
7. If A > 60 and C > 80 and D > 70 and E < 15 and (A + C) > 200, then output is 2
8. If A > 80 and B < 10 and C > 40 and D > 65 and E > 30, then output is 4
