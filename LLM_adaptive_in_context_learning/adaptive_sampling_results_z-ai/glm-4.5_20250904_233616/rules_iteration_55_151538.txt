PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 55
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 75 and E > 85 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
2. If D > 40 and E > 60 and (D + E) > (A + B + C), then output is 4
3. If A < 10 and D > 60 and (D - A) > 55, then output is 3
4. If B > 80 and C > 80 and D > 70 and E > 70, then output is 4
5. If A > 85 and C > 90 and (A + C) > (B + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 2
6. If A < 5 and E > 85 and (E / A) > 30, then output is 2
7. If C > 80 and D < 30 and E < 30, then output is 3
8. If A > 70 and D > 85 and E > 70 and (A + D + E) > (B + C) * 3, then output is 4
9. If A < 30 and B > 85 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
10. If B > 85 and D > 75 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 1.4, then output is 1
11. If C < 5 and (A + B + D + E) > 100, then output is 3
