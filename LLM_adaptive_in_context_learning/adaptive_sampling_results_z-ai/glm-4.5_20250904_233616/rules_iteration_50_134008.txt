PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 50
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If E > 60 and D < 25 and (E / D) > 4 and C > 50 and A + B < 100, then output is 2
2. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 80 and D > 60 and E > 60, then output is 1
3. If A > 80 and B < 30 and C < 15 and D > 40 and E > 50, then output is 1
4. If (A + B + C + D + E) < 100 and A < 20 and B < 20 and C < 20 and D < 20 and E < 40, then output is 2
5. If A > 90 and B > 90 and C > 85 and D < 40 and E < 35, then output is 2
6. If A < 15 and B < 60 and C < 60 and D < 30 and E < 65 and (A + D) < (B + C + E) * 0.7, then output is 3
7. If A < 35 and B < 40 and C > 85 and D > 55 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.5, then output is 3
8. If A > 80 and B < 30 and C < 25 and D < 20 and (A / (B + C + D)) > 3 and E < 50, then output is 2
9. If A < 40 and B < 70 and C < 70 and D < 25 and E < 20 and (D + E) < (A + B + C) * 0.5, then output is 3
10. If A > 70 and B > 60 and C > 60 and D > 40 and E < 30 and (A + B + C + D) > E * 10, then output is 1
11. If A < 30 and B > 60 and C > 60 and D > 80 and E > 70 and (A / (B + C + D + E)) < 0.1, then output is 1
12. If A > 90 and B > 70 and C > 50 and D < 30 and E < 20 and (A / (D + E)) > 4, then output is 1
13. If A < 50 and B < 30 and C > 70 and D < 25 and E < 20 and (C / (B + D + E)) > 2, then output is 3
14. If A > 85 and B > 85 and D > 80 and C < 30 and E > 45 and (A + B + D) > (C + E) * 5, then output is 1
15. If A < 60 and B > 85 and C > 60 and D > 75 and E < 25 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 5, then output is 3
16. If A > 85 and B > 45 and C > 50 and D < 35 and E > 70 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
17. If A > 75 and C > 90 and E > 90 and B < 35 and D < 20 and (C + E) / (B + D) > 8, then output is 2
