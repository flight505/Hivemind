PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 34
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 65 and E > 30 and C < 70 and (A / C) > 1 and (A / D) > 1.5, then output is 1
2. If B > 65 and D > 30 and (B / A) > 1.2 and (B + D) > (A + C + E), then output is 4
3. If B > 65 and A < 90 and E < 60 and (B / E) > 1.5 and (A + E) < (B + C + D), then output is 3
4. If D < 30 and C > 55 and (C / D) > 2 and (A + B) < (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 2
5. If B > 70 and D > 70 and E > 65 and A + B + C + D + E > 350, then output is 1
6. If A > 80 and D < 40 and E > 70 and (A / D) > 2.5 and (A + E) > (B + C) * 1.5, then output is 1
7. If B > 60 and C > 60 and D > 80 and (B + C + D) > (A + E) * 2.5 and E < 50, then output is 4
8. If B > 90 and A < 15 and C > 65 and D > 30 and E > 70, then output is 4
9. If A < 20 and E > 80 and D < 10 and (E / D) > 8 and (E / A) > 4, then output is 2
10. If A > 85 and B < 10 and C < 50 and D < 60 and E > 70, then output is 1
