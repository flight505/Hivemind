============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 70 and B > 85 and C > 85 and E > 90 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 2.5, then output is 1
2. If A > 60 and B > 65 and C < 25 and D > 65 and E > 50 and (B + D + E) > (A + C) * 3, then output is 1
3. If A > 80 and C < 25 and D < 25 and E < 15 and (A / (C + D + E)) > 10, then output is 1
4. If B > 70 and C > 95 and D < 35 and A > 50 and E > 25 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 1.5, then output is 4
5. If A < 30 and B < 60 and C > 85 and D > 75 and E < 15 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 4, then output is 3
6. If A < 20 and B < 70 and C < 20 and D < 25 and E < 20 and (A + B + C + D + E) < 120, then output is 4
7. If A > 40 and B > 65 and C < 5 and D > 80 and E < 15 and (D / C) > 20, then output is 1
8. If A > 30 and B > 50 and C > 45 and D < 20 and E < 30 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 4, then output is 2
9. If A < 10 and B < 15 and C < 50 and D > 75 and E > 60 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 5, then output is 3
10. If A < 15 and B > 65 and C < 35 and D > 30 and E > 45 and B > A * 6, then output is 3
11. If A > 50 and B > 50 and C > 30 and D > 65 and E < 20 and (D / E) > 3.5, then output is 4
12. If A > 80 and B > 60 and C > 50 and D > 40 and E > 30 and (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 2
13. If A > 35 and B < 30 and C > 25 and D > 35 and E > 60 and (E / B) > 3, then output is 4
14. If A > 40 and B > 75 and C > 65 and D > 50 and E > 75 and (B + C + D + E) > A * 6, then output is 3
15. If A < 25 and B > 70 and C > 40 and D < 25 and E < 25 and B > (A + C + D + E), then output is 3
16. If A < 10 and B > 70 and C > 80 and D > 60 and E > 85 and (B + C + D + E) > (A + E) * 3, then output is 1
17. If A < 10 and B > 40 and C < 30 and D < 20 and E > 50 and (E / (A + B + C + D)) > 1.5, then output is 2
18. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C > 60 and D > 40 and E > 50 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 1.8, then output is 2
