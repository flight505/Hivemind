IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A > 70 and (D < 35 or (D > 90 and C > 90)) and (A - D) > 40 and ((A > 80 and E > 35) or (A > 70 and B > 30 and E < 25) or (A > 75 and D < 35 and E > 75))) or (A > 60 and D > 90 and C > 90 and B < 15), then output is 1

2. If E < 30 and ((A < 25 and C > 60) or (A > 90 and E < 10) or (A > 35 and B > 70) or (A < 30 and B < 10) or (A > 85 and C > 75)) and ((C + E) > (A * 0.3 + B * 0.2) or (A + B) < (C + D)) and ((A + C + E) > (B + D) or (C > 60 and B > 70) or (E < 25 and D > 40) or (B > 70 and C > 40)), then output is 2

3. If D > 70 and ((E < 25 and (A + B) > 60) or (E > 30 and A < 35)) and ((D + E) > (A + B + C) * 0.8 or (D > 75 and E < 40) or (E < 25 and D < 75)) and ((D / E) > 2.5 or (B > 80 and C > 75) or (D > 75 and E < 25) or (E > 60 and D > 80) or (D > 70 and E < 40 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 0.8) or (E < 25 and B > 80 and C > 90)), then output is 3

4. If A < 25 and B < 20 and E > 65 and (E / (A + B + 1)) > 2 and (E + C) > (A + B + D + E) * 0.6, then output is 4
