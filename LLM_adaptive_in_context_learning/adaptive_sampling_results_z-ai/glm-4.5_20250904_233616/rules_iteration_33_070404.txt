============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 90 and C < 45 and B < 30, then output is 1
2. If A > 90 and C < 30 and B > 50, then output is 1
3. If A > 70 and B > 70 and C < 25 and D > 30, then output is 1
4. If D > 80 and (A + B + C + E) < (D * 2.5) and A < 40, then output is 3
5. If A < 15 and B > 70 and E > 75 and (B + E) > (A + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 4
6. If E < 10 and B > 60 and C > 60, then output is 4
7. If A > 80 and B > 80 and C < 70 and D < 50, then output is 2
8. If C > 95 and D < 10, then output is 1
9. If B > 85 and D > 85 and E > 85 and A < 30 and C < 35, then output is 3
10. If A > 90 and E > 90 and C < 50, then output is 1
11. If A > 80 and B > 70 and C > 80 and D < 15, then output is 1
12. If C > 95 and E < 35, then output is 3
13. If A < 20 and D < 40 and E < 30, then output is 3
14. If C > 80 and D > 80 and A < 15 and B < 40, then output is 3
15. If A > 65 and E > 75 and C < 25 and (A + E) > (B + C + D), then output is 1
16. If E > 55 and D < 40 and B < 40 and (E / D) > 1.5, then output is 2
17. If E > 80 and D < 60 and A > 80 and C > 60, then output is 2
18. If C > 70 and E < 35 and (C / E) > 3, then output is 3
