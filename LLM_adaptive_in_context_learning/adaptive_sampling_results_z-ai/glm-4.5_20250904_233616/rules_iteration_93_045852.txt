PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 93
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A < 15 and B < 15 and C < 15 and D < 15 and E < 15 and (A + B + C + D + E) < 75, then output is 2
2. If E > 90 and A < 20 and B < 15 and C < 15 and D < 15 and E > (A + B + C + D) * 2, then output is 3
3. If (D > 70 and E > 70 and (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 1.5) or (B < 20 and D > 45 and (D / B) > 4 and (D > A or D > E)), then output is 4
4. If B > 85 and C < 35 and D < 40 and E > 60, then output is 3 if A < 25, otherwise output is 1
5. If C > 60 and E > 60 and A < 25 and B < 15 and D < 30 and (C + E) > (A + B + D) * 2, then output is 4
6. If (B > 60 and D > 60 and E > 70 and C < 20 and (B + D + E) > (A + C) * 2) or (A > 70 and C < 10 and E < 35 and (A / C) > 10 and (A / E) > 2), then output is 2
7. If A > 80 and B > 60 and C > 65 and D > 80 and E > 90 and (A + B + C + D + E) > 350, then output is 1
8. If (A > 80 and D < 15 and (A / D) > 7 and (A + E) > (B + C) * 1.5) or (A > 90 and A > B and A > C and A > D and A > E and (A / (B + C + D + E)) > 0.5), then output is 1
9. If (C > 85 and (A + B + D + E) < 250 and (C / (A + B + D + E)) > 0.4) or (B > 80 and (A + C + D + E) < 300 and (B / (A + C + D + E)) > 0.3), then output is 1
10. If (C > 70 and A < 25 and D < 50 and (C / A) > 3) or (C > 90 and D > 90 and E < 25 and (C + D) > (A + B + E) * 1.5) or (D > 85 and (B + C + E) < 200 and (D / (A + B + C + E)) > 0.4), then output is 3
