============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 80 and E > 80 and C < 30 and D < 40, then output is 1
2. If A > 70 and C < 15, then output is 1
3. If D > 90 and (B > 75 or C > 60), then output is 4
4. If B < 10 and D > 30 and (A + C + E) > 100, then output is 4
5. If D > 90 and B < 50, then output is 4
6. If (A + E) > 150 and B < 55 and C < 30, then output is 1
7. If (B + D) > 150 and A < 80, then output is 4
8. If A > 80 and E > 40 and (C + D) < 70 and (A / E) > 1.2, then output is 2
9. If A > 60 and C > 50 and E > 50 and (A + B + C + D + E) < 300, then output is 2
10. If C > 90 and E < 10 and D > 70, then output is 2
11. If A < 20 and B > 60 and C < 10 and D > 60, then output is 4
12. If B > 90 and C > 80 and E > 95, then output is 1
13. If B < 5 and C < 25 and D > 30 and E > 30, then output is 2
14. If B > 90 and C < 5 and E < 5, then output is 1

18. If B < 25 and C > 65 and D < 30 and E > 80 and (C + E) > (A + B + D), then output is 4
19. If (A - B) > 40 and C < 25, then output is 1
20. If E > 85 and (E / C) > 3.5 and B < 60, then output is 1
