============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C > 85 and E > 85 and B < 20 and D < 20 and (C + E) > (B + D) * 5, then output is 4
2. If C > 90 and (D > 90 or C > (A + B + D + E) / 2) and A < 25 and B < 25, then output is 3
3. If D < 15 and A > 40 and B > 40 and C > 60 and D < (A + B + C) / 4, then output is 2
4. If B > 80 and D > 75 and A < 35 and C < 25 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 1.5, then output is 2
5. If B > 80 and E < 5 and (B / E) > 10, then output is 3
6. If (A > 60 and E > 75 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.1) OR (E > 95 and E > (A + B + C + D) / 2), then output is 4
7. If A > 90 and E > 90 and C < 20 and (A + E) > (B + C + D) * 1.5, then output is 1
8. If A < 10 and B > 75 and (B / A) > 10, then output is 3
9. If A < 10 and B < 20 and C > 90 and C > (A + B) * 5, then output is 3
10. If A > 95 and B < 30 and C > 70 and (A / B) > 4, then output is 2
11. If A > 60 and B > 95 and C > 65 and D > 75 and E > 85 and B > (C + D + E) / 3, then output is 1
12. If A < 15 and C < 25 and D < 15 and E > 60 and E > (A + B + C + D) * 1.2, then output is 3
13. If A < 35 and B < 10 and C < 5 and D > 35 and D > (A + B + C + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
14. If A > 75 and D > 85 and B > 35 and C > 55 and E > 50 and (A / D) < (D / B), then output is 1
15. If C < 5 and A > 60 and B > 65 and D > 75 and E > 60 and (A * E) > (B * D), then output is 1
16. If A > 80 and B > 65 and D < 25 and C > 45 and E > 40 and (A / D) > 3, then output is 1
17. If B > 80 and D > 60 and A > 25 and C > 30 and E > 45 and (B + D) > (A + C + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
