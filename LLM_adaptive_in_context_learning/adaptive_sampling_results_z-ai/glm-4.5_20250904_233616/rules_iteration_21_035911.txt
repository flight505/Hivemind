============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C > 85 and A < 30 and D < 40 and (E > 30 and E < 50), then output is 3
2. If E > 90 and A < 30 and B > 60 and C > 70 and D < 35, then output is 4
3. If B < 15 and C > 80 and A < 50 and D < 35 and (C / B) > 5, then output is 4
4. If A > 55 and C < 20 and E > 70 and D < 10 and (A / D) > 10, then output is 1
5. If C > 75 and E < 10 and (A > 75 or D > 75), then output is 1
6. If A < 30 and B > 45 and C < 10 and D < 10 and E < 10, then output is 2
7. If A â‰¥ 95 and B < 15 and C < 25 and D < 10 and E > 60, then output is 2
8. If A > 70 and B > 45 and B < 55 and C > 90 and D < 40 and E > 90, then output is 2

10. If A > 95 and B < 30 and C > 50 and C < 70 and D < 25 and E > 50, then output is 1
11. If B > 65 and C > 70 and D > 40 and (B + C) > (A + D + E) * 1.2, then output is 4
12. If A > 70 and C < 10 and D > 60 and E < 10 and (A + D) > (B + C + E) * 2, then output is 1
13. If A < 20 and B > 60 and C < 20 and D > 95 and E > 55, then output is 3
