============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 80 and E > 70 and D < 25 and C < 40 and (A / (D + C)) > 4, then output is 1
2. If (B > 85 and C > 65 and D > 60 and E > 50) and (A + B + C + D + E) > (A + E) * 2.5, then output is 1
3. If A > 25 and B < 20 and C > 45 and D < 15 and E > 40 and (C / (B + D)) > 5, then output is 2
4. If (A + C + E) > (B + D) * 2 and C > 50 and E > 60 and D < 50 and (E / B) > 1.5, then output is 2
5. If B < 30 and C < 35 and D > 35 and E > 50 and (A + E) > (B + C) * 2.5, then output is 3
6. If B < 20 and C > 85 and D > 25 and E > 55 and (C / (A + B + D)) > 1.5, then output is 4
