IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A > 80 and D < 25 and (A + B + C) > (D + E) * 2, then output is 1

3. If D < 30 and E < 40 and (A + B + C) < 120, then output is 2
4. If C > 90 and D < 40 and E < 35, then output is 2
5. If D > 90 and A < 50 and (C + E) < 140, then output is 3
6. If B < 15 and D > 70 and E < 25, then output is 3
