PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 89
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 1.2*(A*E)/(S^2) — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction that outweighs D·E while B and C remain limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., D and E together drive the outcome via a dominant D·E interaction while A·B and A·E remain constrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D, A+E do not collectively dominate, C is moderate, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (D/S) <= 0.45 — i.e., A is the clear single-driver whose interactions with E and B are substantial enough to indicate class 1 even if D and E are nontrivial.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND C/S >= 0.25 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND E/S <= 0.45 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 — i.e., a strong A·C·D triple interaction with C important and B/D balance favors class 3.]

7. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D, E all contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains small.]

8. [Predict 2 (edge-case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + C))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND A/S <= 0.40 AND (C/S) <= 0.45 — i.e., B is predominant and its interactions with A or C support class 2 while D·E is not strong.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict label = index of M if M/S >= 0.28 AND (M * second_largest)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.12, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant feature plus its nearest interaction while still conditioning on the combined contribution of all five features.]
