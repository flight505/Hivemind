PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 142
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 when (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND D/S <= 0.36 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while C, B and D remain limited.]

2. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., B is the principal driver supported by a B·E interaction while A, C and the A·D interaction are not dominant.]

3. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C leads with a substantive C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and the triple A·B·E is small.]

4. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A, B and the A·C interaction remain limited.]

5. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 (secondary) when C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., three-way C·D·E support with low A·B.]

6. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 (secondary) when C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C important with supportive A+E and a meaningful A·C·D triple interaction while B and D are balanced.]

7. [Fallback global scoring: let S = A + B + C + D + E. Compute four normalized scores using all five features and pairwise/triple interactions:
   score1 = 0.34*(A/S) + 0.24*(E/S) + 0.18*(A*E/S^2) - 0.12*(C/S) - 0.10*(B/S) + 0.06*(D/S);
   score2 = 0.32*(B/S) + 0.22*(E/S) + 0.14*(B*E/S^2) - 0.10*(A/S) - 0.08*(C/S) + 0.10*(D/S);
   score3 = 0.36*(C/S) + 0.20*(D/S) + 0.12*(C*D/S^2) - 0.10*(A/S) - 0.08*(B/S) + 0.10*(E/S);
   score4 = 0.34*(D/S) + 0.26*(E/S) + 0.14*(D*E/S^2) - 0.10*(A/S) - 0.10*(B/S) + 0.06*(C/S).
   Predict the class with the highest score (score1→1, score2→2, score3→3, score4→4).]
