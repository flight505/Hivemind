PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 61
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.003 — i.e., A and E together strongly dominate, C and D are small, A·E interaction is meaningful, and the five-way joint magnitude is negligible so no other feature jointly rivals A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and the full five-way joint magnitude remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and no large five-way joint effect.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.004 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the five-way joint magnitude is low.]

5. [Predict 4 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.007 — i.e., E is extremely influential together with D, the A·E pair is not disproportionately larger than D·E, cross-contributions from B·C are limited, and the full five-way product remains modest, favoring outcome 4.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and there is no overwhelming five-way joint dominance.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares with a nontrivial triple C·D·E interaction while A·B remains low; when the full five-way magnitude is non-negligible in combination with a strong C·D·E pattern prefer 4.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and P <= 0.005, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and P <= 0.005, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and P <= 0.005, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the single dominant feature proportion but require the five-way joint magnitude to be small before trusting single-feature dominance).]
