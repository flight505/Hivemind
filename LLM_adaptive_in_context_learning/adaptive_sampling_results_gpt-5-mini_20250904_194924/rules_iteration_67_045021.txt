PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 67
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.24 AND D/S <= 0.40 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while B, C, D are collectively limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.03 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C contributes noticeably, and A·B and AB·C remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the primary driver, C·D is significant, B and D are balanced, and cross-products involving A and E are not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads with supportive B·D interaction while A and E do not jointly dominate and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND B/S >= 0.18 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., a three-way B·C·D balance with limited A and limited A·E interaction points to class 3.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D and E jointly contribute with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

7. [Predict 1 when borderline (fallback for A/E dominance) letting S = A + B + C + D + E: if A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 then predict 1.]

8. [Predict 2 when borderline (fallback for B dominance) letting S = A + B + C + D + E: if B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 then predict 2.]

9. [Predict 3 when borderline (fallback for C dominance) letting S = A + B + C + D + E: if C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 then predict 3.]

10. [Final fallback — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.02; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.02; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.02; otherwise predict 4 — ensuring every decision uses ratios and cross-products that involve all five features. ]
