PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 45
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0015 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, B and C are not large, and the full five-way interaction is at least minimal.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 AND C/S <= 0.34 — i.e., D and E together dominate with strong D·E interaction while A and B remain limited and the complete five-way product is not large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0009 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A+B restrained, and there is at least a small full-feature interaction.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B leads with supportive B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the five-way product is limited.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D balanced, A·C·D interaction strong, and all five features jointly contribute.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares with a meaningful triple interaction while A·B remains low and the five-way product is not dominant.]

7. [Predict 1 when none of the above apply but A and E together are clearly dominant relative to others, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0006 — i.e., fallback to class 1 when A and E lead but other middle interactions remain constrained while still including all five features.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) (normalized full interaction), compute normalized shares a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S; predict the class corresponding to the largest of {a,b,c,d,e} only if that largest share >= 0.30 AND P <= 0.025; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-feature decision but require full five-feature context through P and S).]
