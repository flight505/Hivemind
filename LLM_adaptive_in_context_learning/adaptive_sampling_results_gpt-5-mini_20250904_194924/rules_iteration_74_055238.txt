PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 74
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D are not proportionally large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E dominate, C materially supports them and A+B remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.35 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.36 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 — i.e., C is the clear primary contributor, C·D interaction is meaningful, A+E are small-to-moderate, and B and D are relatively balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads with B·D support while A+E and the A·C·E triple are constrained.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., three-way dominance by C, D and E with a nontrivial triple interaction and A,B relatively minor.]

6. [Predict 1 (override of B-dominant signals) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S >= 0.25 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.40 — i.e., even if B is large, a sufficiently strong A+E dominance and A·E interaction should favor class 1.]

7. [Predict 2 (override of D/E-dominant signals) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (D + E)/S <= 0.48 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 — i.e., B with strong B·D interaction and limited A+E support indicates class 2 even if D or E are moderate.]

8. [Interaction-max rule (tie-breaker): letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing normalized interactions I1=(A*E)/(S^2), I2=(B*D)/(S^2), I3=(C*D)/(S^2), I4=(D*E)/(S^2), if max{I1,I2,I3,I4} >= 1.15 * second_max AND max{I1,I2,I3,I4} >= 0.06 then predict the class corresponding to the maximal interaction (I1->1, I2->2, I3->3, I4->4) while also requiring (A+B+C+D+E)=S to ensure all five features are present in normalization.]

9. [Fallback dominant-proportion rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.70, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.70, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.70, predict 4 if M is D or E and (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportion with complementary constraints that reference all five features.]
