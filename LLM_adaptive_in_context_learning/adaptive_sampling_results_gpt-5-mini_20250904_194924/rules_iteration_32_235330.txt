PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 32
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND |B - A|/S <= 0.32 — i.e., A and E together dominate with substantive three-way A·B·E support, while C and D remain limited and A and B are not highly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.02 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.28 — i.e., a concentrated A+B+E majority with a strong A·E interaction and modest cross-support from B·C while D and C stay constrained.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a clear D·E interaction while the combined contribution and interaction of A,B,C remain limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D*A)/(S^3) >= 0.028 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is primary, supported by a meaningful C·D·A interaction, with A+E not dominant, B and D reasonably balanced, and B·E interaction small.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., B leads and is reinforced by B·D·E interaction while A+E together and A·C remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (multi-component) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., three-way C·D·E support indicates class 4 when A·B interaction is small.]

7. [Predict 3 (support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., strong C with an A·C·D interaction and moderate A+E support, with B and D balanced.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict the class corresponding to M if M/S >= 0.33 AND P <= 0.012, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use a clear single-feature dominance only when all five features collectively indicate low overall multiplicative dispersion; otherwise default to class 4.]
