PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 110
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) >= 0.028 AND max(B, D)/S <= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with substantial supporting C through a significant three-way A·C·E interaction while neither B nor D are overwhelmingly dominant.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.36 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.018 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction and C provides additional support while the combined influence of A and B (and their three-way with C) remains limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.008 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained and balanced with D, and cross-coupling A·E not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.048 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together are not large and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/(S) <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A and B remain collectively low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful while B·D is not overwhelmingly large.]

7. [Correct common misclassifications where two opposing rules compete: if two of the above rule-conditions are simultaneously true, choose the prediction whose normalized pairwise-sum product is larger where score_k = sum of selected rule's leading-feature shares * corresponding pairwise-product (e.g., for rule predicting X use Score = Σleading_i/S * Π(pairwise products among leading features)/S^m); implement tie-break by selecting the rule with larger (Πleading_features)/(S^n) to ensure preference for stronger multivariate interactions — i.e., resolve conflicts by comparing the strength of multifeature interactions rather than single-feature dominance.]

8. [Fallback complex decision rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and for each class compute a composite interaction score that uses all five features: Score1 = (A + E)/S * (A*E*C)/(S^3) * (1 - max(B, D)/S), Score2 = B/S * (B*D*A)/(S^3) * (1 - max(C, E)/S), Score3 = C/S * (C*D*B)/(S^3) * (1 - max(A, E)/S), Score4 = (D + E)/S * (D*E*C)/(S^3) * (1 - max(A, B)/S); predict the class with the largest Score (ensuring all five inputs influence the calculation).]
