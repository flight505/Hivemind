PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 138
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.28 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, C and D are limited, B is not large, and the A·E interaction is meaningful.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D, A and E together are restrained, C is moderate, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is primary, C·D is relevant, B and D are balanced, A+E are not dominant, and A·E interaction is not strong.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a solid D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction outweighs a low A·B.]

6. [Pair-competition rule — if no single feature dominates (max{A,B,C,D,E}/S < 0.35) and there exists a pair X,Y among {A,B,C,D,E} with (X + Y)/S >= 0.45 AND (X*Y)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND ((sum of the remaining three)/S) <= 0.40, then predict according to the dominant pair mapping: pair (A,E) -> 1; pair (B,D) -> 2; pair (C,D) or (C,B) -> 3; pair (D,E) or (C,E) -> 4. This enforces pairwise interactions while accounting for all five features via S and the remaining-features constraint.]

7. [Competition-score tie-breaker — letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute:
score1 = (A*E)/(S^2) + 0.45*(A + E)/S - 0.20*(B + C + D)/S;
score2 = (B*D)/(S^2) + 0.45*B/S - 0.20*(A + C + E)/S;
score3 = (C*D)/(S^2) + 0.45*C/S - 0.20*(A + B + E)/S;
score4 = (D*E)/(S^2) + 0.45*(D + E)/S - 0.20*(A + B + C)/S.
Predict the class with the largest score. This uses products, sums, and penalties ensuring all five features influence the decision.]

8. [High-C correction — letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if C/S >= 0.35 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (B/(1 + A + D)) <= 0.40 then predict 3. This ensures very strong C (with D support) is not overridden by A/E or a single large B.]

9. [High-A-with-low-E correction — letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if A/S >= 0.30 AND E/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.04 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.50 then predict 1. This prevents misclassification when A is clearly leading but E and joint interactions are weak.]

10. [Robust fallback requiring full-feature confirmation — letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if none of the above rules apply then compute normalized contributions rA=A/S, rB=B/S, rC=C/S, rD=D/S, rE=E/S and predict:
1 if rA + rE >= max{rB + rD, rC + rD, rD + rE} + 0.05;
2 if rB + rD >= max{rA + rE, rC + rD, rD + rE} + 0.05;
3 if rC + rD >= max{rA + rE, rB + rD, rD + rE} + 0.05;
otherwise predict 4.
This uses all five features via S and pairwise comparisons to make a conservative, multi-feature decision.]
