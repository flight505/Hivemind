PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 122
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A is the primary driver with meaningful A·E support, while C is not large and cross-terms among B, C, D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads and is reinforced by B·D, while A+E and the A·C·E triple do not dominate.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., C is dominant with a substantive C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, A·E not dominant, and B and D reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and the triple A·B·C remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D, and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is meaningful while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction matters, and B·E remains limited.]

7. [Fallback complex score — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores s1 = (A/S)*(E/S) - (B*C*D)/(S^3), s2 = (B/S)*(D/S) - (A*C*E)/(S^3), s3 = (C/S)*(D/S) - (A*B*E)/(S^3), s4 = (D/S)*(E/S) - (A*B*C)/(S^3); predict the class k corresponding to the largest sk provided max{s1,s2,s3,s4} >= 0.02, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use balanced multiplicative interactions among all five features as a tie-breaking global rule.]
