PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 34
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E are jointly dominant both individually and multiplicatively while C and B are not large relative to S.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (A*(S - A))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND D/S <= 0.45 — i.e., A is the clear leader, its interaction with E is meaningful, and the remaining features do not collectively overwhelm A.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is the principal contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together remain limited and the triple A·B·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the main driver with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not a major effect.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A, B and C do not jointly exceed supporting thresholds.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C, D and E all contribute substantially and their triple interaction favors class 4 while A·B remains small.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is substantial.]

8. [Fallback composite-scoring rule — if none of the above apply, compute scores for each class using all five features and predict the class with highest score where S = A + B + C + D + E:
   score1 = 1.6*(A/S) + 0.9*(E/S) + 1.2*(A*E/S^2) - 0.8*(C/S) - 0.4*(B/S) - 0.3*(D/S);
   score2 = 1.5*(B/S) + 0.9*(D/S) + 0.8*(B*D/S^2) - 0.6*(A/S) - 0.5*(C/S) - 0.4*(E/S);
   score3 = 1.7*(C/S) + 1.0*(D/S) + 0.9*(C*D/S^2) - 0.6*(A/S) - 0.4*(B/S) - 0.5*(E/S);
   score4 = 1.6*(D/S) + 1.1*(E/S) + 1.0*(D*E/S^2) - 0.5*(A/S) - 0.5*(B/S) - 0.6*(C/S).
   Use all five features in each score; predict the label corresponding to the largest score.]
