PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 155
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND D/S <= 0.20 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND B/(S) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while D is low and neither B nor C challenge the A+E dominance.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.08 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction, A and B are limited, and C contributes to the D/E-led group.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D support, A·E is weak, B and D are balanced, and A+B are not collectively dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads with B·D supporting interaction while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-feature consensus) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D and E all provide substantial shares and their triple interaction dominates while A·B is small.]

6. [Predict the class of the dominant feature M (A->1, B->2, C->3, D/E->4) as a tie-breaker when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = max(A,B,C,D,E) and N = second largest of {A,B,C,D,E}, M/S >= 0.30 AND (M*N)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (S - (M + N))/S <= 0.55 — i.e., one feature is clearly dominant, it has meaningful pairwise interaction with the next largest, and the remaining features do not together overwhelm them.]

7. [Override to predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, A·C·D triple interaction is strong, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

8. [Fallback conditional that always uses all five inputs: let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute scores for classes: score1 = (A + E) / S * (A*E)/(S^2) ; score2 = B/S * (B*D)/(S^2) ; score3 = C/S * (C*D)/(S^2) ; score4 = (D + E)/S * (D*E)/(S^2) ; predict the class with the largest score provided that its proportion term (A/S, B/S, C/S, or (D+E)/S respectively) >= 0.25; if none meet 0.25, predict 4. — i.e., compute interaction-weighted proportion scores using all five features and require a minimum share before selecting a class.]
