PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 81
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND min(B, C, D)/S <= 0.20 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.035 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate and interact strongly while the other three features are collectively small, with A and E not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND min(A,B)/S <= 0.15 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong pairwise and triple interaction while A and B remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (B/S) >= 0.10 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, A and E are constrained, B provides moderate support and B and D are balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B leads with B·D support, A and E do not jointly dominate, C is not dominant, and the five-way joint signal is weak.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low and the full five-way dominance is limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are relatively balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful while B·E remains limited.]

7. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.38 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.62 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 AND median({A,B,C,D,E})/S <= 0.22 — i.e., A and E together are clearly leading even if not extremely dominant, the middle-level contributions are limited, and the overall five-way joint signal is not strong.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, use the full-five-feature joint signal and dominant-proportion to decide: predict 1 if M is A or E and (M/S) >= 0.30 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02; predict 2 if M is B and (B/S) >= 0.30 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03; predict 3 if M is C and (C/S) >= 0.30 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the single-feature dominance only after evaluating the global five-way joint interaction and requiring all five features be considered. ]
