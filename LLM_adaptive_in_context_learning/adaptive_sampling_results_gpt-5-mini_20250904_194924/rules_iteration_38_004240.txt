PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 38
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 AND (D/(A + C + 1)) <= 0.60 — i.e., A is the clear leader in the full-sum context, A·E interaction is substantial, C is relatively small, B is not large compared with the A+E core, and D does not outweigh A when all five are considered.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A/(B + C + 1)) <= 0.80 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate the full-sum with a strong D·E interaction while A and B together remain limited relative to the D/E core.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the principal contributor in the five-way sum, C·D interaction is meaningful, A+B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and the A·E interaction is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads, supported by a B·D interaction, while A+E and the triple A·C·E are limited in the full five-feature context.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., three-way support from C, D and E creates a stable D/E-centered outcome even if none singly dominates, while A·B remains modest.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide meaningful support without overwhelming, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D three-way interaction is nontrivial.]

7. [Fallback decision rule (use only if none of the above rules apply), letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 then predict 1; else if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 then predict 2; else if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 then predict 3; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the five-feature normalized dominant signal plus a reinforcing pairwise interaction to decide. ]
