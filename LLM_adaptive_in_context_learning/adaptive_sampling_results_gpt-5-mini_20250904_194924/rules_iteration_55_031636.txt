PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 55
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.24 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction, C and D are limited, B is small relative to A+E, and the triple B·C·D is negligible.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a meaningful D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain constrained and the A·B·C triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a substantive C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, A·E not large, and high-order B·D·E interaction absent.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.31 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (A + C + D)/(S) >= 0.25 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor reinforced by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and the remainder of features give minimal support.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.016 AND (A + B)/(S) <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E each supply meaningful shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B and the combined A+B share remain limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.032 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important with A+E providing supportive share, B and D balanced, a meaningful A·C·D triple, and B·E kept modest.]

7. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.66 — i.e., A is strongly dominant and both A·B and A·E interactions are substantial while the competing C·D interaction is small and the remainder of features collectively provide background support.]

8. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (C/(A + B + 1)) <= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E jointly large with a meaningful D·E product, C small relative to A+B, higher-order A·B·C negligible, and A and B not extremely imbalanced.]

9. [Fallback general rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, predict 4 if M is D or E and (max(D,E))/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportion but require checks on high-order interactions among the other four features.]
