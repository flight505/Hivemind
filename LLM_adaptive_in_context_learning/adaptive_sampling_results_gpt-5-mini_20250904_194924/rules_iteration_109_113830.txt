PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 109
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., A and E jointly provide a clear dominant share and a strong A·E interaction while C is limited, the B·D interaction is not strong, and the five-way intensity is low.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.44 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND |B - C|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and C remain restrained and three-way A·B·C intensity is low.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.34 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.055 AND B/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and E do not jointly dominate, A·E interaction is small, and B is not large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D while A+E do not overpower and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.22 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (edge case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (C*B)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 AND |C - D|/S >= 0.10 — i.e., A is dominant and interacts strongly with D+E but the cross-support from C·B is weak and the overall five-way intensity is low, indicating an A-driven outcome.]

7. [Fallback complex tie-breaker — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.30 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.035; predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.30 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.035; predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.035; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the dominant feature proportion together with the product-of-the-rest constraint so all five features are considered).]
