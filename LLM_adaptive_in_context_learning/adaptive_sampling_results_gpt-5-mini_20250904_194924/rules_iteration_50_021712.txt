PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 50
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.12 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E together provide a large share, their pairwise interaction is the strongest normalized pair, and the competing B·D interaction is limited (all five features used via S and pairwise products).]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND A/S <= 0.38 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a substantial D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited (conditions reference all five features).]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the principal contributor supported by C·D, A and B are collectively moderate, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominant (uses all five features).]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads as a single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited (all five features included).]

5. [Predict the class corresponding to the dominant normalized pairwise interaction when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing P_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), P_BD=(B*D)/(S^2), P_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), P_DE=(D*E)/(S^2), P_AB=(A*B)/(S^2): if the maximum of {P_AE,P_BD,P_CD,P_DE} is at least 0.05 AND exceeds the next-highest pair by >= 0.02, then predict 1 if max is P_AE, predict 2 if max is P_BD, predict 3 if max is P_CD, predict 4 if max is P_DE — provided additionally that each feature's share A/S, B/S, C/S, D/S, E/S are all checked to ensure none is below 0.03 (so all five features participate via S).]

6. [Predict 4 when C, D and E provide coordinated support: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., a three-way C·D·E synergy drives class 4 while A·B remains weak (uses all five via S and product terms).]

7. [Resolve mixed-high-feature cases by net-support score when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute score1 = 0.6*(A/S) + 0.4*(A*E)/(S^2), score2 = 0.6*(B/S) + 0.4*(B*D)/(S^2), score3 = 0.6*(C/S) + 0.4*(C*D)/(S^2), score4 = 0.6*((D+E)/S) + 0.4*(D*E)/(S^2); if the top score exceeds the second-best by >= 0.06 and all five features have nonzero shares relative to S, predict the class with the top score (ensuring all five features enter the decision via S and pairwise terms).]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04, otherwise predict 4 (the fallback requires all five through S and pairwise interactions).]
