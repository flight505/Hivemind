PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 101
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, C is relatively small, B·D interaction is limited, and B and D are not strongly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C provides support but A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.44 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B together are restrained, A·E is not dominant, and B and D are reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B leads as the main contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the A·C·E triple interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is important with a meaningful A·C·D interaction, A+E give supporting share within bounds, B and D are balanced, and B·E interaction is limited.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E} and m = argmin{A, B, C, D, E}; predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 and (m*(S - M - m))/S^2 <= 0.04, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 and (m*(S - M - m))/S^2 <= 0.04, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 and (m*(S - M - m))/S^2 <= 0.04, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant feature proportion only when its dominance is clear relative to the smallest and the remaining combined mass, otherwise default to class 4.]
