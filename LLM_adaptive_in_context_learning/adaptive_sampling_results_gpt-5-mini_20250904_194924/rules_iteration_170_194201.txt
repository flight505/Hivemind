PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 170
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A - max(B, C, D, E))/S >= 0.12 AND (A*(C + D + E))/S^2 >= 0.20 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A is the clear leader relative to every other single feature, A has strong combined interactions with the C+D+E block and with E specifically, while B is not overwhelmingly large.]

2. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.25 AND (A*(B + E))/S^2 >= 0.14 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND B/S <= 0.50 — i.e., A leads and its pairwise interactions with B and E plus a supportive A·C·D triple indicate class 1 in the context of all five features.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A*(B + C))/S^2 <= 0.16 AND (B/S) <= 0.48 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A, B, C combined interactions are limited.]

4. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D, E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C*(A + D))/S^2 >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.22 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.62 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND |A - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C combined with A and D drives the label while B and E are supportive but not dominant, considering all five features.]

7. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads and its interaction with D is important while A+E do not dominate and the A·C·E triple remains limited.]

8. [Predict 2 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B*(A + C))/S^2 >= 0.10 AND B/S >= 0.26 AND (D + E)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (C/S) <= 0.45 — i.e., B-driven patterns with supporting interactions to A and C indicate class 2 under the full five-feature context.]

9. [Fallback scoring rule (use if none of the above apply): let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute class scores using all five features and cross-terms: Score1 = 1.4*(A/S) + 0.9*(A*E/S^2) + 0.6*(A*(C + D)/S^2) - 0.5*(D/S) - 0.4*(B/S); Score2 = 1.2*(B/S) + 0.8*(B*D/S^2) + 0.5*(B*(A + C)/S^2) - 0.4*(E/S) - 0.3*(C/S); Score3 = 1.3*(C/S) + 0.9*(C*D/S^2) + 0.6*(C*(A + E)/S^2) - 0.5*(B/S) - 0.3*(A/S); Score4 = 1.4*((D + E)/S) + 1.0*(D*E/S^2) + 0.5*((C + D + E)*A/S^2) - 0.4*(B/S) - 0.3*(C/S). Predict the class with the highest Score (this combines all five features and their interactions).]
