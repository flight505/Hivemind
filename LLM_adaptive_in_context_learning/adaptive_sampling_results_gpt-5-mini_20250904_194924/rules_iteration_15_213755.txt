PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, (A+E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.28 AND (B/(A+E+1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, C and D are small-to-moderate, B is not large relative to A+E, and the full five-way interaction is weak.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, (D+E)/S >= 0.40 AND ((C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 OR (A+E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.035) AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., D and E together are dominant and there is a substantive three-way C·D·E or strong C·D interaction (even when A+E are large), with the full five-feature pattern supporting class 4.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, C/S >= 0.28 AND |B-D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND E/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, E is not dominant, and the five-way product supports the pattern.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, (B+D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B+D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A+E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.004 — i.e., B (often with D) provides a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C is not the primary driver, the A·B·E triple is limited, and the five-way interaction is not strong.]

5. [Override-to-4 correction: Predict 4 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, (A+E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (D+E)/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., even when A+E are large (which often suggests class 1), a strong C·D interaction together with substantial D+E indicates class 4.]

6. [Resolve B-vs-C ambiguity: Predict 3 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, B = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (C+D)/S >= 0.38 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A+E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., even if B is the single largest feature, a substantial combined C+D and their interaction (plus the five-way context) favors class 3.]

7. [Edge-case favor-2: Predict 2 when, letting S = A+B+C+D+E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A+E)/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.002 — i.e., B (with D) is clearly dominant while A+E and full five-way interaction are limited.]

8. [Final multivariate scoring fallback (applies only if none of rules 1–7 match): let S = A+B+C+D+E and compute scores using all five features: score1 = 0.55*(A+E)/S - 0.25*(C+D)/S + 0.15*(A*E)/(S^2) + 0.05*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); score2 = 0.50*(B)/S + 0.30*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A+E)/S + 0.05*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); score3 = 0.60*(C)/S + 0.25*(A*C*D)/(S^3) - 0.15*(E)/S + 0.05*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); score4 = 0.50*(D+E)/S + 0.20*(C*D*E)/(S^3) - 0.20*(A*B)/(S^2) + 0.05*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5). Predict the class with the largest score — i.e., use a weighted multifeature interaction score that depends on all five inputs.]
