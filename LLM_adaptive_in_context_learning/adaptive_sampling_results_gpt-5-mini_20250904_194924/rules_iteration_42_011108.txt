PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 42
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, count{f in {A,B,C,D,E} : f/S >= 0.20} >= 3 AND ((A*E + A*B + B*E)/S^2) >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND min(A,B,E)/S >= 0.10 — i.e., three or more features share substantial mass, the A–B–E pairwise interactions are collectively strong while the C·D cross-interaction is limited, so class 1 reflects broad multi-feature strength concentrated on A/B/E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction, A·B remains limited and C is not large, so outcome 4 corresponds to a D–E driven regime.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A/E do not jointly dominate, so classify as 3.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E remain restrained, indicating class 2.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, count{f in {A,B,C,D,E} : f/S >= 0.20} >= 4 AND ((sum of the three largest pairwise products)/S^2) >= 0.40 AND min(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.10 — i.e., a nearly-uniformly high profile across most features with strong top-pair interactions indicates class 1.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., a three-way C–D–E concentration with nontrivial triple interaction and weak A·B implies class 4.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 when M = A and A/S >= 0.28, predict 2 when M = B and B/S >= 0.28, predict 3 when M = C and C/S >= 0.28, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion while requiring the global normalization by S so all five inputs influence the decision.]
