PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 21
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate both in sum and multiplicative interaction while C, D and B remain relatively small.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (|B - D|)/S >= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.02 — i.e., C is the primary driver, B and D are substantially imbalanced (so balance-based rules that predict other classes fail), A+E are not dominant, and the B·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.18 — i.e., D and E collectively dominate and the D·E·C triple interaction is substantial while A and B remain limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.55 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (|B - D|)/S <= 0.25 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate, reasonably balanced share, A+E do not dominate, C is not large, and the A·B·E triple interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A + B)/(S) <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially while the A·B interaction and A+B combined remain limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (|B - D|)/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.65 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share without dominating, B and D are not extremely imbalanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Tie-break / conflict-resolution rule — if more than one of the rules above applies, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute four class-scores that incorporate all five features: 
   score1 = 0.5*(A+E)/S + 0.5*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.3*C/S - 0.2*B/S - 0.1*D/S; 
   score2 = 0.4*(B+D)/S + 0.3*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.2*(A+E)/S - 0.2*C/S; 
   score3 = 0.5*C/S + 0.3*(B*C*D)/(S^3) - 0.2*(A+E)/S - 0.1*(A*B)/(S^2); 
   score4 = 0.5*(D+E)/S + 0.3*(C*D*E)/(S^3) - 0.2*(A+B)/S - 0.1*(A*B)/(S^2). 
   Predict the class with the highest score — this uses all five inputs to resolve overlapping patterns.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above numeric thresholds are met (i.e., data are near-uniform), let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized contributions a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S and the five-way interaction I = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); predict the class whose corresponding weighted affinity (class1_affinity = 0.45*a + 0.35*e + 0.20*I; class2_affinity = 0.40*b + 0.35*d + 0.25*I; class3_affinity = 0.60*c + 0.25*I; class4_affinity = 0.35*d + 0.35*e + 0.30*I) is largest — i.e., use a combined-sum-and-product affinity score that requires all five features. ]
