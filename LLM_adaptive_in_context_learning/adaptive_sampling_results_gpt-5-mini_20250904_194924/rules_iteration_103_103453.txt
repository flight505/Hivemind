PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 103
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.34 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND B/S <= 0.36 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, C and D are relatively small, the A·E interaction is substantial, and B is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.115 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 — i.e., C is primary, C·D is meaningful, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.29 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.0175 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A is dominant with supportive A·B·C and A·E interactions while D and C are not large.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, and an A·C·D interaction supports class 3.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict class corresponding to M if M/S >= 0.30 AND P <= 0.015, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use a dominant-single-feature decision only when one feature clearly dominates and the overall five-way product indicates lack of broad balance.]
