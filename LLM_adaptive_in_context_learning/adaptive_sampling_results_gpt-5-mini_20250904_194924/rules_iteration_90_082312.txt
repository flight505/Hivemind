PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 90
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.32 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, the combined middle contributors B·C·D are collectively small, B and D are not wildly imbalanced, and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.035 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the triple A·B·C is limited and C is not excessive.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.055 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A + B + E)/S >= 0.18 — i.e., C is the primary contributor supported by a meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is small, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the remaining features provide modest support.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor backed by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C remains moderate-to-small, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.65 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C/S) <= 0.35 — i.e., A is the strongest single contributor with meaningful A·E interaction, D is not proportionally overwhelming relative to A+E, B·C are small, and C is not dominant.]

6. [Predict 2 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/(A + E + 1) >= 0.50 AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.04 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.065 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is proportionally large even compared with A+E, A·E is weak, C·D is limited, and the A·C·E triple is small.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A/(B + C + D + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D, and E each provide substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low and A is not dominant versus the rest.]

8. [Fallback composite scoring rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores using all five features:
   score1 = (A + E)/S + 1.8*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.9*(B*C)/(S^2) - 0.9*(C*D)/(S^2);
   score2 = B/S + 1.6*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(C*D*E)/(S^3);
   score3 = C/S + 1.6*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(A*B)/(S^2);
   score4 = (D + E)/S + 1.6*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A*B)/(S^2) - 0.8*(A*C)/(S^2);
   Predict the class (1, 2, 3, or 4) with the largest score — i.e., use a weighted combination of per-feature shares and key pair/triple interactions that involves all five inputs.]
