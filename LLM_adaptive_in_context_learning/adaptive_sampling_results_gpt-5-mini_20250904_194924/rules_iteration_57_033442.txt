PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 57
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.20 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B + C)/(S) >= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while B is small, C·D is limited, and the remainder shares still involve all features.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D, A and E are restrained, C is not dominant, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B are collectively limited, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E jointly substantial with a nontrivial triple interaction while A and B together are limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C important with supporting A+E, B and D balanced, and a strong A·C·D triple interaction while B is not overwhelming.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08; otherwise predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.35 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., use dominant-feature logic only when supported by multifeature interactions and require conditions involving all five inputs.]
