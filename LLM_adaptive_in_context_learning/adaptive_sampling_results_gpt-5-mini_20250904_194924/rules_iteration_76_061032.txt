PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 76
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.28 — i.e., A is the principal contributor, A·E and A·B·D interactions are strong, C is restrained, and D+E provide supporting share.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while combined A,B and A·B·C remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., C is the main driver with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D balanced, A+E not dominant, and A·B·E interaction limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads, supported by B·D, while A+E and triple A·C·E are constrained.]

5. [Predict 1 (highly balanced/high-magnitude case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, min(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.22 AND A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) >= 0.045 AND (C/S) >= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 — i.e., all five features are simultaneously substantial and balanced but A is the largest and higher-order A·B·D·E interaction favors class 1.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A/S) <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 — i.e., the triple C·D·E interaction dominates and A is comparatively small, favoring class 4.]

7. [Resolve ambiguous high-total cases by scoring (fallback that still uses all features): letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute score1 = 0.45*(A/S) + 0.25*(A*E/S^2) + 0.15*(A*B*D/S^3) + 0.15*(D/S); score2 = 0.50*(B/S) + 0.20*(B*D/S^2) + 0.15*(B*C/S^2) + 0.15*(E/S); score3 = 0.50*(C/S) + 0.25*(C*D/S^2) + 0.15*(B/S) + 0.10*(1 - (A*E/S^2)); score4 = 0.45*((D + E)/S) + 0.25*(D*E/S^2) + 0.15*(C*E/S^2) + 0.15*(1 - (A/S)); predict the class with the largest score — i.e., use a combined normalized-interaction scoring relying on all five features.]
