PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 104
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.38 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 1.10*(A*E)/(S^2) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E together supply a large share, their pairwise interaction is substantial and at least not weaker than the competing D·E interaction, B is not simultaneously the dominant partner, and C is not dominant.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 1.10*(D*E)/(S^2) AND (B + C)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, A·E is not stronger, the remaining features do not collectively override D+E, and large three-way A·B·C is absent.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, the C·D interaction is meaningful, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·E is not dominating, and A+B remain collectively restrained.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E do not collectively dominate and the three-way A·C·E interaction is limited.]

5. [When the top two normalized pairwise interactions among {A*E, D*E, C*D, B*D, A*B} are within 10% of each other (let Pmax = max pairwise and P2 = second max), resolve by triple-interaction comparison: compute T1 = A*C*E, T2 = A*B*D, T3 = A*C*D, T4 = C*D*E (all normalized by S^3). Predict the class whose associated triple Tclass is maximal AND Tclass/(S^3) >= 0.018; additionally require that the feature-sum share for that class's primary features (e.g., A+E for class 1, B + D for class 2, C + D for class 3, D + E for class 4) >= 0.30. This uses all five features to break close pairwise ties by preferring stable three-way cohesion.]

6. [If none of the above specific patterns apply, use a structured dominance tie-breaker: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict class 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.60*max{(A*E),(D*E),(C*D),(B*D),(A*B)}; predict class 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.50*max{pairwise}; predict class 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.50*max{pairwise}; predict class 4 if M is D or M is E and (D+E)/S >= 0.28 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.50*max{pairwise}. This fallback enforces that a dominant single feature only decides the class when its supporting pairwise interaction (involving the second key feature) is also comparatively strong, incorporating all five features via S and pairwise maxima.]
