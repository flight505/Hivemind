PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 154
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND D/S <= 0.45 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate proportionally with a substantial A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max(A,B,C,D,E) AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.65 — i.e., A is the single largest contributor, its interaction with E is meaningful, and cross-support from B·D and C is restrained.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads with B·D support while A and E together and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND ((C*D) + (C*E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.65 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., C is a primary driver with substantial C·(D or E) interactions, A and B collectively restrained, B and D roughly balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.70 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., three-way support from C, D and E with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B is low.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C important with moderate A+E support, balanced B and D, and a meaningful A·C·D triple interaction.]

8. [Predict 2 (override for ambiguous high-B cases) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D + B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., B is dominant and supported by interactions with D or E while A, C and A·E interactions are limited.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and (A + E)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + C + D)/S >= 0.10, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.20, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.20, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion together with proportional constraints on the remaining features so all five inputs influence the decision.]
