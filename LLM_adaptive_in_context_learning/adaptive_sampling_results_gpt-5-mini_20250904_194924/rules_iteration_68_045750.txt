PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 68
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 when (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.54 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.36 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while the combined mass and interaction of B, C, D remain limited.]

2. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the primary single contributor supported by a B·D interaction, A+E are restrained, C is not dominant, and the triple A·C·E is small.]

3. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the leading contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained and balanced relative to D, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate with strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B interaction remain limited.]

5. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. When a single rule above is triggered, use it; when two or more class rules trigger concurrently, resolve by comparing the class-specific interaction strengths computed from all five features: for class1 use I1=(A*E)/(S^2); class2 use I2=(B*D)/(S^2); class3 use I3=(C*D)/(S^2); class4 use I4=(D*E)/(S^2). Predict the class with the largest Ii, provided that class's primary sum proportion (A+E for 1, B for 2, C for 3, D+E for 4) exceeds 0.28. This forces a decision that accounts for every feature through S and the cross-term interactions.]

6. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute materially and their triple interaction outweighs the A·B interaction.]

7. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 (secondary pattern) when C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, compute four class scores that use all five features: S1 = 0.6*(A + E)/S + 0.4*(A*E)/(S^2); S2 = 0.6*(B/S) + 0.4*(B*D)/(S^2); S3 = 0.6*(C/S) + 0.4*(C*D)/(S^2); S4 = 0.6*(D + E)/S + 0.4*(D*E)/(S^2). Predict the class with the largest Si, but only if that Si exceeds the runner-up by at least 0.04; otherwise predict the class whose combined triple interaction (A*B*C + B*C*D + C*D*E + A*D*E)/(S^3) is largest. This fallback forces every decision to depend on all five inputs.]
