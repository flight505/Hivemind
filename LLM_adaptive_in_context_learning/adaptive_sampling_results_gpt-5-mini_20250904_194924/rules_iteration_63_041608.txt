PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 63
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + D + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.26 AND (B + C)/S >= 0.15 AND (max{A,B,C,D,E} - min{A,B,C,D,E})/S <= 0.60 — i.e., A, D and E jointly supply a large share with a significant triple interaction while no single pair (D·E) totally dominates and B+C provide nontrivial support, indicating a multi-feature high-state that maps to class 1.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong pairwise interaction amplified by C while the A·B interaction remains small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B + E)/S >= 0.10 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B restrained and balanced with limited A·E influence.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND (A + C + E)/S >= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D while A and E do not collectively dominate and the triple A·C·E remains limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, the feature distribution is broadly balanced so that min{A,B,C,D,E}/S >= 0.08 AND max{A,B,C,D,E}/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0006 AND (A + D + E)/S >= 0.45 — i.e., all five features contribute meaningfully (balanced high-state) with A+D+E providing slight edge, mapping to class 1 over pair-dominant rules.]

6. [Predict 4 (CDE synergy) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is decisive for class 4.]

7. [Predict 3 (supportive-interaction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B)/(S) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important with A+E providing supporting share and a meaningful A·C·D triple while B remains limited, favoring class 3.]

8. [Fallback (balanced dominance) — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*(D+E))/(S^2) >= 0.06, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the dominant feature plus its cross-feature interactions to decide).]
