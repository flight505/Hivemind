PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 139
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (D/S) <= 0.60 AND ((A + E)/(S) - (B + C)/(S)) >= 0.08 — i.e., A is a clear primary contributor supported by E, the adverse B·C interaction is limited, D is not overwhelmingly dominant, and the A+E advantage over B+C is meaningful.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND ((B - max(A,C,E))/S) >= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor reinforced by B·D, A·E is not strong, C is not dominant, and B exceeds other features by a clear margin.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 AND ((C - max(A,B,E))/S) >= 0.04 — i.e., C is primary with a substantive C·D interaction, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·E is not dominant, and C exceeds other single features.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.115 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND ((D + E) - (A + B + C))/S >= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND ((C + D + E) - (A + B))/S >= 0.10 — i.e., a three-way C·D·E dominance with low A·B support.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.032 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.30 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful while B is not dominant.]

7. [Predict 1 (tie-breaker) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C/S) <= 0.38 AND ((A - B)/S) >= 0.03 AND ((A - D)/S) >= 0.03 — i.e., A has elevated share and A·E supports it while competing B·D interaction is limited and A modestly exceeds B and D.]

8. [Predict 2 (disambiguation) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.26 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A*E*C)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND (C/S) <= 0.40 AND ((B - C)/S) >= 0.03 — i.e., B leads with B·D support, the triple A·C·E is limited, and B exceeds C.]

9. [Predict 4 (safety) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C/(S)) >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (D*E*C)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND ((D + E) - B/S) >= 0.08 — i.e., D and E dominate, C contributes materially, A·B interaction is low, and the D·E·C joint effect exists.]

10. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting scores = {s1 = (A*E)/(S^2) - (B*C)/(S^2), s2 = (B*D)/(S^2) - (A*E)/(S^2), s3 = (C*D)/(S^2) - (A*B)/(S^2), s4 = (D*E)/(S^2) - (C*A)/(S^2)}, predict the class with the largest score among {1,2,3,4}; if all scores are within 0.01 of each other, predict the class corresponding to argmax{A, B, C, D, E} (requires all five features via S).]
