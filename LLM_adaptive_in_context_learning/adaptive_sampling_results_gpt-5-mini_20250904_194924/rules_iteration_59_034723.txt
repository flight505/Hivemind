PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 59
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND B/S <= 0.38 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A and E together dominate while C and D are limited, B is not comparatively large, and the A·E interaction is substantial.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.38 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E and A·B are restrained and C is not dominant.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary, C·D is meaningful, A and E provide a bounded supporting share, B and D are relatively balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while joint A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B stays low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share within bounds, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND |B - E|/S <= 0.32 — i.e., A is dominant with a reinforcing A·B·E interaction, C is limited, D·E is not overly strong, and B and E are not highly discrepant.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30, predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.40, otherwise predict the class whose pairwise highest product with another feature is maximal (i.e., compute pair products A·B, A·C, A·D, A·E, B·C, B·D, B·E, C·D, C·E, D·E and predict the class corresponding to the dominant feature participating in the largest product), ensuring all five features contributed to the decision through S and the product calculations.]
