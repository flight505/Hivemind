PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 3
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B)/S >= 0.52 AND (A * B)/(S^2) >= 0.18 AND (C * D * E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND A/E >= 1.05 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate the total with a strong pairwise interaction while the triple interaction of the remaining features is small and A is not small relative to E.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D)/S >= 0.45 AND (C * D)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND A/S <= 0.25 AND |B - E|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C and D together dominate with a strong mutual interaction, A is relatively small, and B and E are balanced.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (D * E * A)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E dominate the total with a significant three-way interaction involving A while B and C remain relatively small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S is between 0.22 and 0.55 AND (A + E)/S is between 0.25 and 0.65 AND (A * B * C * D * E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 AND max(A,B,C,D,E)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., B and D form a moderate share, A and E supply a complementary share, the full five-way product is not extreme, and no single feature completely dominates.]

5. [Predict 2 (balanced-case fallback) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, max(A,B,C,D,E)/S <= 0.30 AND min(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.08 AND variance{A,B,C,D,E}/S^2 <= 0.015 — i.e., the five features are relatively even with low relative variance, indicating a balanced interdependence best assigned to class 2.]

6. [Tie-break / override for high-interaction anomalies: for any prediction, if letting S = A + B + C + D + E the normalized five-way interaction (A * B * C * D * E)/(S^5) >= 0.02 AND one of the pairwise interactions (A*B, C*D, D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 strongly favors a class by aligning with rules 1–4 conditions, override to that class — i.e., when both a strong global five-way interaction and a dominant pairwise interaction co-occur, trust the combined-interaction signal.]
