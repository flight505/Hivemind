PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 62
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 1 when (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E together dominate, their interaction is substantial, C and D are relatively small, and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 1 when A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., strong A leadership amplified by A·D and supported by A·E while C is small and cross-noise from B·E is low.]

3. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

4. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 3 when C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary share, C·D is meaningful, A+ B are restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E does not dominate.]

5. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B leads with B·D support while A+E do not dominate and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

6. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 4 when C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., C, D and E each have substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction and A·B remains low.]

7. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, predict 3 when C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E, fallback decision: compute M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}. If (M/S) >= 0.30 AND (M*second_max)/(S^2) >= 0.05 then predict the class corresponding to M; otherwise predict the class corresponding to the largest two-way interaction among {A*E, B*D, C*D, D*E} normalized by S^2 (choose 1 for A·E highest, 2 for B·D highest, 3 for C·D highest, 4 for D·E highest) — i.e., require a dominant feature proportion plus a meaningful two-way interaction among all five features before committing. ]
