PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 25
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate the total, the C·D·E interaction is strong, A·B pair is weak, and the full five-way normalized product is not excessively large.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.008 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, B and D are balanced, A·C interaction is appreciable, A+E do not dominate, and the five-way product shows meaningful joint contribution.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are small-to-moderate, B is not large relative to A+E, and the normalized five-way product is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., B and D provide a clear moderate share, A+E do not dominate, C is not dominant, A·B·E triple interaction is limited, and full five-way product stays small.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.30 AND (D/S >= 0.18 OR C/S >= 0.22) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.07 — i.e., E is clearly large, supported by D or C, A·B remains low, and the normalized five-way product is moderate to low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S is between 0.12 and 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.006 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, and the five-way product indicates joint relevance.]

7. [Predict 1 when conflict between 1 and 2 arises and, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., A is the dominant single driver with others relatively smaller and the overall five-way product small.]

8. [Predict 2 when conflict between 2 and 4 arises and, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND E/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., B and D jointly outweigh E, three-way A·B·C is limited, and the five-way product is not large.]

9. [Fallback consolidated rule — if none of the above apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized contributions a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); predict the class whose normalized contribution plus scaled joint signal is largest: choose class1 if a + 0.8*P5 is maximal, class2 if b + d + 0.6*P5 is maximal, class3 if c + 0.9*P5 is maximal, class4 if d + e + 0.7*P5 is maximal — i.e., use all five features and the five-way product together to break ties.]
