PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 72
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.36 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a substantive A·E interaction while B and C remain limited and D is not dominant.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND ((A + B)*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate and their interaction is strong while A·B and C-related cross terms are constrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 — i.e., C is the main contributor, C·D is meaningful, A+B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the primary single contributor supported by B·D, while A+E and triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 2 (override for strong B dominance with low A and C) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.36 AND A/S <= 0.18 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (E/(S)) <= 0.50 — i.e., B clearly dominates with low A and C and sufficient B·D support even if D+E are moderate.]

6. [Predict 1 (override when A interacts with B and C despite D+E) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND E/S >= 0.12 AND D/S <= 0.42 — i.e., A is dominant and its pairwise interactions with B and C are substantive, tipping to class 1 even if D or E are nontrivial.]

7. [Predict 3 (multi-feature support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND E/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C-centered triple and pairwise interactions plus B/D balance support class 3.]

8. [Predict 4 (multi-component triple) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is meaningful while A·B and A+B do not dominate.]

9. [Fallback scoring rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores for each class using all five features: Score1 = 0.45*(A+E)/S + 0.30*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.15*(B+C)/S; Score2 = 0.50*(B)/S + 0.30*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.10*(A+E)/S; Score3 = 0.48*(C)/S + 0.28*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.12*(A*E)/(S^2); Score4 = 0.46*(D+E)/S + 0.28*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.14*(A*B)/(S^2). Predict the class with the highest score (i.e., use an all-five-feature interaction score-based tie-breaker).]
