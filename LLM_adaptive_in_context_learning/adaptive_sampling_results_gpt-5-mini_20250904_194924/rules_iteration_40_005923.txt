PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 40
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (B*(C + D))/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a substantive A·E interaction while B and the combined B·(C+D) influence remain limited and C is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND (C/(A + B + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with C reinforcing the D·E block while A·B and the absolute A+B share are restrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is limited, B and D are relatively balanced, and A+B do not collectively dominate.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads with support from B·D while A+E remain moderate-to-small, C not excessive, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 — i.e., the C–D–E trio provides balanced substantial shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B and A+B remain modest.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.032 AND (B/(S + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and B is not overwhelmingly large.]

7. [Resolve conflicts: if more than one rule applies, compute rule scores Rk for each applicable rule k as the minimum z-normalized satisfaction across that rule's conditions (treat each condition as a normalized score between 0 and 1 using S-based denominators) and choose the rule with highest Rk; if tie within 0.03, prefer rule with larger product-of-key-interactions (e.g., A*E for rule 1, D*E*C for rule 2/5, C*D for rule 3, B*D for rule 4).]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if (A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (B + C)/(S) <= 0.60), predict 2 if (B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.60), predict 3 if (C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08), otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature logic only after verifying minimal interaction-based consistency across all five features.]
