PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 172
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C and the C·D interaction remain limited and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND C/(D + E + 1) <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B jointly are restrained and C is not large relative to D+E.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (B/(A + C + D + E + 1)) <= 0.55 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak, and B is not overwhelming relative to the rest.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, and the A·B interaction is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Predict 1 when A–E dominance competes with D–E dominance: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.9*(D*E)/(S^2) AND B/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., when A+E jointly dominate and the A·E interaction is at least comparable to the D·E interaction while B and C are not too large, prefer class 1.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion while conditioning on the full-sum S).]
