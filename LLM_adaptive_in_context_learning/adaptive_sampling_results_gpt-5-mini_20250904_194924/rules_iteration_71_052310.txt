PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 71
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, B·D is weak, C is not dominant, and the full five-way normalized product remains limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and the five-way product are limited.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain constrained.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is primary with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+B collectively restrained, B and D reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple supports the C-led outcome.]

5. [When both (A + E)/S >= 0.35 and (D + E)/S >= 0.35 (competing A+E vs D+E dominance), let S = A + B + C + D + E; if (A*E)/(S^2) >= 1.1*(D*E)/(S^2) AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.40 predict 1; else if (D*E)/(S^2) >= 1.1*(A*E)/(S^2) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.40 predict 4 — i.e., resolve A+E vs D+E conflict by comparing A·E and D·E interactions while checking B and C contributions.]

6. [Override to predict 2 even when C is large: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if C/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S >= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 predict 2 — i.e., strong B·D support and substantial B can shift a C-dominant profile to class 2.]

7. [Override to predict 3 when D-driven profiles would otherwise predict 4: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if D/S >= 0.30 AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (E/(S)) <= 0.30 predict 3 — i.e., when C·D interaction is strong enough relative to A·B and E, choose class 3 over class 4.]

8. [Fallback structured decision: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1=(A+E)/S, P2=B/S, P3=C/S, P4=(D+E)/S, compute pairwise interaction scores I1=(A*E)/(S^2), I2=(B*D)/(S^2), I3=(C*D)/(S^2); if max{P1+I1, P2+I2, P3+I3, P4+(D*E)/(S^2)} corresponds to P1+I1 predict 1, corresponds to P2+I2 predict 2, corresponds to P3+I3 predict 3, otherwise predict 4 — ensuring all five features influence the comparative scores through S and the interaction terms.]
