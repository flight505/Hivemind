PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C/S) >= 0.15 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.75 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate while C is a meaningful contributor, the A·B interaction is small, and the C·D·E triple interaction is large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND D/S >= 0.28 AND (B/S) <= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A and E give a big share but a substantial D shifts the pattern to class 4, with B small and A·E interaction present.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND |B - D| <= 0.18 * S AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND E/S <= 0.30 AND (A + B + E)/S >= 0.18 — i.e., C is primary, B and D are balanced, A·C interaction is appreciable, E is not dominant, and other features supply supporting mass.]

4. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 — i.e., A and E together clearly dominate while C and D are small-to-moderate and B is not large relative to A+E.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate-to-large share, A and E do not dominate, C is not dominant, and the A·B·E triple interaction is limited.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and the triple C·D·E interaction pushes to class 4 while A·B remains low.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (B/S) <= 0.35 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide a supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction exists, and B is not overly dominant.]

8. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B/S) <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (D/S) <= 0.28 — i.e., A and E strongly dominate, C and D are modest, B is not large, and A·E interaction supports class 1.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized fractions fA=A/S, fB=B/S, fC=C/S, fD=D/S, fE=E/S and also compute the five-way balance metric B5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); predict 1 if fA is the unique maximum AND fA >= 0.26 AND B5 <= 0.01; predict 2 if fB is the unique maximum AND fB >= 0.26 AND B5 <= 0.01; predict 3 if fC is the unique maximum AND fC >= 0.26 AND B5 <= 0.02; predict 4 if fD or fE is the unique maximum OR B5 > 0.02 — i.e., use the largest normalized contributor together with the full five-way interaction to decide when none of the complex multi-feature patterns above match.]
