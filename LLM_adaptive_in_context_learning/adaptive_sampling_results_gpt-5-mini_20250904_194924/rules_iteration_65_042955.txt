PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 65
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.25 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate the total, their pairwise interaction is strong, C is relatively small, and all five features are considered via S.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C provides supporting share, A and B are not jointly dominant, and the rule depends on all five inputs.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.33 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND B/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, A and E provide limited support, B is restrained, and every feature enters through S and product terms.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D, A and E do not jointly dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the condition uses all five features.]

5. [When no single-sum dominance rule clearly applies, resolve by strongest normalized pairwise interaction: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and I_AE = (A*E)/(S^2), I_BD = (B*D)/(S^2), I_CD = (C*D)/(S^2), I_DE = (D*E)/(S^2), and T = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), if max{I_AE,I_BD,I_CD,I_DE} >= 0.12 AND T <= 0.035 then predict 1 if I_AE is the max, predict 2 if I_BD is the max, predict 3 if I_CD is the max, otherwise predict 4 if I_DE is the max — i.e., choose the class whose defining pairwise interaction is strongest while confirming higher-order quintuple interaction is not dominant.]

6. [Handle high-uniform sums (balanced high values) by triple-interaction contrast: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and T1 = (A*C*D)/(S^3), T2 = (A*C*E)/(S^3), T3 = (C*D*E)/(S^3), T4 = (A*B*D)/(S^3), if max{T1,T2,T3,T4} >= 0.035 AND min{A,B,C,D,E}/S >= 0.08 then predict 3 if T3 is max, predict 1 if T2 is max, predict 2 if T4 is max, otherwise predict 4 if T1 is max — i.e., use dominant triple interactions among all five features to disambiguate balanced-high cases.]

7. [Fallback/general tie-breaker — if none of the above rules fires, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute dominance scores: S1 = (A*(A+E))/(S^2) + (A*B*C)/(S^3), S2 = (B*(B+D))/(S^2) + (A*B*D)/(S^3), S3 = (C*(C+D))/(S^2) + (A*C*D)/(S^3), S4 = (D*(D+E))/(S^2) + (C*D*E)/(S^3). Predict the class with the largest Si. This tie-breaker uses sums, products and combined interactions of all five features to produce a general prediction when specific patterns do not apply.]
