PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 48
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (A + B)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND P5 <= 0.020 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate in share and pairwise interaction while the triple interaction of the remaining features is limited and the five-way normalized interaction is small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND P5 <= 0.030 — i.e., D and E together drive the outcome with a strong D·E interaction, C provides supporting mass, A·B remains weak, and the full five-way interaction is not large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND P5 <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the clear dominant contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and E are collectively limited, B and D are balanced, and the overall five-way interaction is modest.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND P5 <= 0.030 — i.e., B leads as the single largest share with supporting B·D interaction while A and E do not collectively dominate and the five-way interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND P5 >= 0.012 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, A·B is low, and the normalized five-way interaction is at least moderate.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND P5 <= 0.028 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share within bounds, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D triple is meaningful, and the five-way interaction remains limited.]

7. [Fallback conditional (use only if none of the above apply) — let S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) and let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; then: if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06 predict 1; if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06 predict 2; if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.05 predict 3; otherwise if (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.08 predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportions together with constraints on the complementary four-way interaction to decide.]
