PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 39
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.35 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., B is the clear leader reinforced by B·D, A and E together are small, C is restrained, and the triple A·C·E is negligible.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is dominant with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B are collectively moderate, B and D are balanced, and cross-products with A or E are limited.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B axis remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative multi-feature pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D, E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction dominates while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (supporting interaction pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support, B and D are balanced, and A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful while B·E is limited.]

7. [Predict 1 when mixed dominance favors A but E moderates the outcome: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., A is the dominant single contributor and its interaction with E is nontrivial while other pairwise interactions are weak.]

8. [Fallback balanced-rule (uses all five features): if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(B*D)/(S^2), P3=(C*D)/(S^2), P4=(D*E)/(S^2), and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, then predict:
   - 1 when M is A and A/S >= 0.26 and P1 >= max(P2,P3,P4)/2,
   - 2 when M is B and B/S >= 0.30 and P2 >= max(P1,P3,P4)/2,
   - 3 when M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and P3 >= max(P1,P2,P4)/2,
   - 4 otherwise (i.e., choose the class whose dominant feature has a sufficient proportion and whose relevant pair/triple interaction is comparably strong).]
