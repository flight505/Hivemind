PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 162
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C is small-to-moderate, the B·D support is limited, and B and D are not highly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is weak, A+B collectively restrained, and B/D are reasonably balanced.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B pair remain limited and triple A·B·C is small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the clear leading contributor supported by B·D, A+E do not collectively dominate, C is not excessive, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., three-way support from C, D, E with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Conflict-resolution scoring rule — compute three class scores using all five features: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, Score1 = 1.6*(A + E)/S + 2.0*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(C + D)/S - 0.6*(B/(S+1)), Score2 = 1.6*(B)/S + 1.4*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.7*(A + E)/S - 0.5*(C/(S+1)), Score3 = 1.8*(C)/S + 1.6*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.7*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.5*(B/(S+1)), Score4 = 1.7*(D + E)/S + 1.9*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(A + B)/S - 0.5*(C/(S+1)); predict the class with the highest Score (requires all five features in every term).]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply (no rule thresholds met or tied scores), letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1 = (A + E)/S * (A*E/(S^2)), P2 = (B)/S * (B*D/(S^2)), P3 = (C)/S * (C*D/(S^2)), P4 = (D + E)/S * (D*E/(S^2)); predict class k with largest Pk, breaking ties by selecting the class whose complementary pairwise interactions with the remaining features are strongest (use (A*B*C)/(S^3), (A*B*E)/(S^3), (B*C*D)/(S^3), (C*D*E)/(S^3) respectively) — this fallback uses all five features for every decision.]
