PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 147
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND B/(A + E + 1) >= 1.05 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., B is the clear single leader relative to A and E, supported by a meaningful B·D interaction while the triple A·C·E and the overall five-way concentration remain limited.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B is small, C·D is limited and the five-way product is not large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a significant C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and no dominant all-feature product.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B interaction remain limited and overall five-way concentration is low.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.040 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains small and no extreme five-way concentration.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful without a dominant five-way product.]

7. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND B > A AND B/(A + 1) >= 1.10 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.050 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., B is the plurality and strictly exceeds A with supporting B·D interaction while A·C·E and overall five-way concentration are limited.]

8. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND A > B AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.050 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.003 — i.e., A is dominant (and stronger than B) with meaningful A·E coupling but not overwhelmed by mid-level B·C·D coupling and with a non-negligible five-way presence.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), compute relative shares rA=A/S, rB=B/S, rC=C/S, rD=D/S, rE=E/S; then:
   - predict 1 if rA = max{rA,rB,rC,rD,rE} AND rA >= 0.28 AND P5 <= 0.035;
   - else predict 2 if rB = max{rA,rB,rC,rD,rE} AND rB >= 0.28 AND P5 <= 0.035;
   - else predict 3 if rC = max{rA,rB,rC,rD,rE} AND rC >= 0.28;
   - otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature share together with the five-way product to resolve ambiguous dominance.]
