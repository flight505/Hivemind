PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 43
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A (with supporting E) dominates the total, the A·E interaction is substantial, B is not comparatively large, and C+D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B is the lead contributor reinforced by B·D, A and E together do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, triple A·C·E is limited, and A and E are not extremely imbalanced.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D reasonably balanced, and A·E interaction not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (supporting pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.25 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.38 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A leads and forms moderate reinforcing interactions with B and E while combined C+D are limited and the B·D interaction is not dominant.]

7. [Fallback decision (apply only if none of the above rules match): let S = A + B + C + D + E and let M be the feature with maximum value among {A,B,C,D,E}; predict the class corresponding to M (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D/E) only if M/S >= 0.28 AND the largest pairwise normalized product involving M, max_{X != M}((M*X)/(S^2)) >= 0.05 AND the sum of the two smallest feature proportions <= 0.30; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature plus at least one meaningful interaction and require the weaker features to be collectively small before trusting a single-feature dominance.]
