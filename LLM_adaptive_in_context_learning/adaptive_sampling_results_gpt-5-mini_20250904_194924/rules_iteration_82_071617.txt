PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 82
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S <= 0.34 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND D/S <= 0.34 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while the other three features remain collectively limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.10 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A, B and C do not form a competing interaction.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (B/(A + D + E + 1)) <= 0.28 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and E are restrained, and cross-products involving A·B·E are small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B leads and is supported by B·D while A, C, E do not collectively rival B.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 — i.e., C, D, E jointly substantial with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.04 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C important, A+E provide balanced support, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful while B·E is limited.]

7. [Predict by dominant pair-product when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute normalized pair products P_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), P_BD=(B*D)/(S^2), P_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), P_DE=(D*E)/(S^2); if max(P_AE,P_BD,P_CD,P_DE) >= 0.08 AND the corresponding pair sum (X+Y)/S >= 0.48 AND (product of the remaining three features)/(S^3) <= 0.08 then map pair to class: pair A&E -> predict 1, pair B&D -> predict 2, pair C&D -> predict 3, pair D&E -> predict 4 — i.e., when a specific pair both sums and multiplies to dominate while the other three features are collectively limited, choose the class associated with that dominant pair.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict the class associated with M if M/S >= 0.30 AND (product of the other four features)/(S^4) <= 0.05; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the single strongest normalized contributor only when the remaining four are collectively weak, otherwise default to class 4.]
