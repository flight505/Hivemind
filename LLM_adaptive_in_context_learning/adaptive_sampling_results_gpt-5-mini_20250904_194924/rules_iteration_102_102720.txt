PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 102
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND max(B, C, D)/S <= 0.35 AND ((B - C)^2 + (C - D)^2 + (B - D)^2)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain individually limited and mutually balanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, ((D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10) OR ((C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020), AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., D and E (or the triple C·D·E) collectively dominate with a nontrivial D·E or C·D·E interaction while the A·B interaction stays low.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, C·D interaction is meaningful, B and D are balanced, A·E is limited and A+B do not jointly dominate.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor backed by a B·D interaction while A+E remain constrained, C is not excessive, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Resolve A-versus-B ambiguity: Predict 1 versus 2 when A and B are both substantial, letting S = A + B + C + D + E: if A/S >= 0.26 AND B/S >= 0.26 then compare cross-interactions — if (A*E)/(S^2) >= (B*D)/(S^2) + 0.02 AND (A + E)/(S) >= (B + D)/S - 0.03 then predict 1; else if (B*D)/(S^2) >= (A*E)/(S^2) + 0.02 AND (B + D)/S >= (A + E)/S - 0.03 then predict 2 — i.e., break ties by which dominant feature has the stronger supportive interaction with its natural partner (A with E, B with D), considering all five features via S.]

6. [Handle low-A, high-CDE cases: Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S <= 0.20 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.70 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., when A is subdued and the C-D-E block jointly dominates with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B is small.]

7. [Ambiguity fallback using structured tie-breaks: If none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, choose according to interaction-weighted dominance — predict 1 if M=A and (A/S >= 0.28) and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055; predict 2 if M=B and (B/S >= 0.28) and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055; predict 3 if M=C and (C/S >= 0.28) and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08; predict 4 if M in {D,E} and ((D + E)/S >= 0.40) and (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09; otherwise predict the class whose leading-feature product-with-neighbor (A*E, B*D, C*D, D*E, E*D) is maximal when normalized by S^2 — i.e., use dominance plus its strongest cross-feature support, referencing all five features through S.]
