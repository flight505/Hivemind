PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 124
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*E)/((B + C + D) + 1) >= 0.18 AND A/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.16 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate in share and interaction and their interaction outweighs the combined influence of B, C and D.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (D*E)/((A + B + C) + 1) >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.17 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate and their pairwise interaction is stronger than the combined effect of A, B and C.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C*D)/((A*E) + B + 1) >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., C (with supporting D) is primary, C·D interaction dominates A·E and B is balanced with D.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*D)/((A*C*E) + 1) >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B leads with D support and the B·D interaction outweighs the combined triple influence of A, C and E.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/((A + B) + 1) >= 0.015 — i.e., C, D and E provide substantial balanced shares and their three-way interaction dominates A and B.]

6. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (A*C*D)/((B + E) + 1) >= 0.012 — i.e., C is important, A and E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful relative to B and E.]

7. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*B*C*D)/(S^4) <= 0.02 AND (A*E)/((B + C + D) + 1) >= 0.12 AND E/S >= 0.10 — i.e., A is a dominant single contributor with meaningful A·E support while the combined product of the other features is small.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B*D)/((A + C + E) + 1) >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (C/(S)) <= 0.25 — i.e., B is strongly dominant and its interaction with D clearly outweighs the combined influence of A, C and E.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = {A* (B + C + D + E), B*(A + C + D + E), C*(A + B + D + E), D*(A + B + C + E), E*(A + B + C + D)}, predict 1 if A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*(B + C + D + E))/S^2 >= max(P)/5, predict 2 if B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + C + D + E))/S^2 >= max(P)/5, predict 3 if C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*(A + B + D + E))/S^2 >= max(P)/5, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature share together with its aggregate interaction with the other four features. ]
