PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 152
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate even if A·B is nontrivial, with all five features considered through S and pairwise products.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A and E together drive class 1 while B, C·D interactions remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C (with D) dominates while A·E is not overpowering and B/D are balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B (supported by D) dominates without large A·C·E triple interaction.]

5. [Override to 4 when the apparent single-feature leader is contradicted by D/E co-dominance: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.03 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.30 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.04 then predict 4 — i.e., even with a strong A, insufficient A·E interaction plus substantial D+E and B·C support shifts to 4.]

6. [Predict 3 in mixed C/D regions: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if (C + D)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) >= 0.008 AND B/S <= 0.22 then predict 3 — i.e., C and D together lead but A/E give supporting interaction and B is small.]

7. [Predict 2 when B and E jointly dominate: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND D/S <= 0.25 then predict 2 — i.e., B·E interaction drives class 2 while A·C and D remain limited.]

8. [Balanced-score fallback (uses all five features): letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores:
   score1 = 2*(A + E)/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B + C + D)/S;
   score2 = 2*B/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - (A + C + E)/S;
   score3 = 2*C/S + (C*D)/(S^2) - (A + B + E)/S;
   score4 = 2*(D + E)/S + (D*E)/(S^2) - (A + B + C)/S.
   Predict the class with the largest score; if the top two scores differ by < 0.05, break the tie by selecting the class whose defining pairwise product (A*E for 1, B*D for 2, C*D for 3, D*E for 4) is largest (all calculations normalized by S^2).]
