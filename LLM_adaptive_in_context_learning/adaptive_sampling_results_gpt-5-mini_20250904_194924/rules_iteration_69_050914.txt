PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 69
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND A/S <= 0.12 AND (A*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., E is a clear leader interacting strongly with B and C while A is comparatively small and A·D is weak.]

2. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.24 AND (B + C + D)/S >= 0.55 AND A/S <= 0.18 AND (B*C*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., E plus the combined middle features dominate while A remains limited and the B·C·E triple interaction is meaningful.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND (A*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (B*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A is the primary driver with a supporting A·D interaction while cross-products linking C and E are weak.]

4. [Predict 2 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A leads together with a nontrivial A·B coupling while C and E do not together dominate and B and D are not highly imbalanced.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., C is primary with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·B·E triple influence is small.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with strong D·E interaction while A·B and A·C·E remain limited.]

7. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., the triple C·D·E contribution is nontrivial while A·B is low.]

8. [Fallback dominant-check rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, then: predict 1 if A/S >= 0.28 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05; predict 2 if B/S >= 0.28 AND (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06; predict 3 if C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., require a dominant single feature plus supporting interactions across all five features before selecting that class.]
