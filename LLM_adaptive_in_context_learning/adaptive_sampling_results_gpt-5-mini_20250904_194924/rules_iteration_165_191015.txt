PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 165
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., A and E jointly provide a clear dominant share with a meaningful A·E interaction, B is not too large, C is limited, and cross-support from B·D is weak.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B leads the profile, the B·D interaction is supportive, A+E do not dominate, C is not dominant, and the triple A·C·E is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a substantive C·D interaction, A and B remain collectively restrained, B and D are fairly balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B·C triple remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., C, D, and E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is meaningful while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

7. [Fallback complex tiebreaker — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting pA=A/S, pB=B/S, pC=C/S, pD=D/S, pE=E/S: if max{pA,pB,pC,pD,pE} < 0.36 then predict 4 when (D+E)/S >= 0.34 OR (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015; otherwise predict the class whose pairwise product with its most supportive partner is largest (choose 1 if (A*E) = max((A*E),(B*D),(C*D),(D*E),(A*B)) and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05, choose 2 if (B*D) is max and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06, choose 3 if (C*D) is max and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07, otherwise choose 4 — i.e., resolve ambiguous, balanced profiles by comparing the strongest two-way interactions while still referencing all five features.]
