PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 92
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.38 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.40 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 — i.e., A and E together provide a substantial share, their pairwise interaction is dominant relative to S^2, C and D are not both large, and B is not larger than the A+E block.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·E is not dominant, and A+B do not collectively overwhelm C.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited relative to the D/E block.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor with reinforcing B·D interaction, A+E are not collectively dominant, C is not excessive, and the triple A·C·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND A/S >= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.45 AND B/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A is the single largest feature with nontrivial support from E, and the combined C+D and B shares are restrained.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important, the A·C·D triple and C·D pairwise interactions are meaningful, B and D are not extremely unbalanced, and A·E remains limited.]

7. [Global fallback scoring rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores using all five features:
   score1 = ((A + E)/S) * ((A*E)/(S^2)) * (1 - C/S),
   score2 = (B/S) * ((B*D)/(S^2)) * (1 - E/S),
   score3 = (C/S) * ((C*D)/(S^2)) * (1 - (A*E)/(S^2)),
   score4 = ((D + E)/S) * ((D*E)/(S^2)) * (1 - B/S).
 Predict the class with the highest score (i.e., argmax{score1,score2,score3,score4}) — this uses all five inputs and balances dominant shares, pairwise interactions, and opposing contributions.]
