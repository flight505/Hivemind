PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 143
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.02 — i.e., A and E strongly dominate, their pairwise interaction is substantial, B is small relative to A+E, C and D are limited, and the remaining three-way remainder is negligible.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.09 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.02 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and any A·B·C three-way effects remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.02 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and cross-support from A·E/A·B·E is minimal.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., B leads as the single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and three-way C·D·E effects remain constrained.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.003 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B and full five-way saturation remain low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share without dominating, B and D are reasonably balanced, and a meaningful A·C·D interaction exists while cross B·E support is limited.]

7. [Conflict-resolution: if two or more predictive conditions above hold simultaneously, compute class scores using all five features and choose the class with the largest score, where letting S = A + B + C + D + E: score1 = 2*(A*E)/(S^2) + (A + E)/S - (B + C + D)/S; score2 = 2*(B*D)/(S^2) + B/S - (A + C + E)/S; score3 = 2*(C*D)/(S^2) + C/S - (A + B + E)/S; score4 = 2*(D*E)/(S^2) + (D + E)/S - (A + B + C)/S — i.e., resolve ties by weighted normalized pairwise interactions and total shares across all five features.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict the class corresponding to M only if M/S >= 0.30 AND (product of the other four features)/(S^4) <= 0.02; otherwise predict the class with the largest stabilized score from rule 7 — i.e., require a clear dominant feature while using the full five-way context to avoid ambiguous multi-feature cases.]
