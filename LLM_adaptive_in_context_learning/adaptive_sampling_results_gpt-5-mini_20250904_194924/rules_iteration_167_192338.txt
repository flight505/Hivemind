PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 167
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S <= 0.28 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain relatively small and the normalized five-way product is low.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.47 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.09 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) are limited and the overall five-way product remains small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.33 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, A·E small, and the normalized five-way product not large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and the five-way product is not large.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.005 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, A·B is low, and the normalized five-way product indicates a multi-feature supporting pattern.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.004 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful, and the five-way product signals multi-feature support.]

7. [Predict 2 (edge case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (C/(A + B + D + E + 1)) <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., B leads with B·D support, A·E not dominant, C relatively restrained versus the rest, and the normalized five-way product remains moderate-to-low.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-proportion tie-breakers while requiring the normalized five-way product condition so all five features influence the decision).]
