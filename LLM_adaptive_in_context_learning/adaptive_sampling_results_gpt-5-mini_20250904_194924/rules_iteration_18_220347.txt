PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A * E)/(S^2) >= 0.18 AND (C * D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate both by sum and product while the C·D interaction and B are relatively limited, so the A–E coupling determines class 1.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C * D * E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A * B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.50 AND |D - E|/S <= 0.45 — i.e., D and E collectively dominate and participate in a strong three-way C·D·E interaction while the A·B interaction is weak.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A * C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (C * D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND E/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., C is the primary contributor supported by A·C and C·D interactions, E is not dominant, and B and D are reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B * D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A * B * E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B and D jointly provide a substantial share with a strong B·D interaction while A and E do not dominate and the triple A·B·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A * B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.60 — i.e., C, D and E together make up a clear majority and A·B remains low, favoring class 4.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A * C * D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND B/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, indicating class 3.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E} (tie-broken by largest product with the second-largest feature), predict 1 if M is A, predict 2 if M is B, predict 3 if M is C, predict 4 if M is D or E — i.e., use the overall-max feature within the full five-feature context as a final decision.]
