PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 127
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.52 AND B/S <= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A and E together clearly dominate in proportion and via their interaction while B, C and D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.22 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate both in share and via a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C remain restrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is the primary contributor supported by meaningful C·D and C·E interactions while A and B are collectively limited and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., B leads with supporting B·D interaction, A+E are limited, C is not excessive, and higher-order A·C·E / A·B interactions remain small.]

5. [When A, D and E all have substantial shares and the model must choose between 1 and 4, predict 1 if, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*(B + C + D))/(S^2) >= 0.12 — i.e., prioritize the A·E driven pattern when A's interaction with E and A's overall cross-feature support outweigh the D·E interaction.]

6. [When C, D and E are all substantial and there is confusion between 3 and 4, predict 3 if, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., favor C-driven outcomes when C's pairwise interactions with D and E are jointly meaningful and A·B is weak.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E} and N = the second-largest of {A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (A*(B + C + D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (B*(A + C + D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (C*(A + B + D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-proportion plus its combined interaction with the other four features to decide).]
