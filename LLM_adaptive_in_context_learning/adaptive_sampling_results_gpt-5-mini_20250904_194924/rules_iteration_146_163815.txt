PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 146
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.32 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while the middle features B,C,D do not collectively outweigh A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.02 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B (and their joint effect with C) remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the principal contributor supported by D, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., a three-way C·D·E partnership drives the outcome while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important with A+E providing supporting share, B and D balanced, A·C·D interaction meaningful, and B·E not overpowering.]

7. [Predict 1/2/3/4 by dominant-feature with interaction guard as fallback: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, if (M/S) >= 0.28 AND (product of the other four features)/(S^4) <= 0.035 then predict the class corresponding to M (A->1, B->2, C->3, D or E->4); otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use a dominant-feature decision only when the remaining four do not collectively indicate a significant multivariate interaction, otherwise default to class 4.]
