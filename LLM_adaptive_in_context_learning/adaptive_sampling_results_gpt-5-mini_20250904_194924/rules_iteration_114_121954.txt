PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 114
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 — i.e., C is the primary driver, C·D interaction is meaningful, A and B are collectively restrained, A·E is not dominant, and B and D are reasonably balanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.26 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong interaction while C and A·B influence remain limited.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E together dominate and interact substantially while C is small, B is not large relative to A+E, and B·D support is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·C·D triple interaction contributes.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute nontrivially and their triple interaction is meaningful while A·B remains low.]

7. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S >= 0.05 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., A is clearly large and cooperates with E but A·B and the triple B·D·E are limited.]

8. [Fallback composite scoring rule — let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute score1 = 0.5*(A*E)/(S^2) + 0.5*(A/S) - 0.3*(B*C)/(S^2), score2 = 0.55*(B/S) + 0.45*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.25*(C*E)/(S^2), score3 = 0.55*(C/S) + 0.45*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A*E)/(S^2), score4 = 0.45*(D/S) + 0.45*(E/S) + 0.4*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A*B)/(S^2); predict the label with the highest score — i.e., a balanced decision that uses all five features through proportions and pairwise/triple interactions.]
