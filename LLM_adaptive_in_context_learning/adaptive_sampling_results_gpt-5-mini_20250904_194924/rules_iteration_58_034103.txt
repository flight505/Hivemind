PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 58
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.26 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a substantial A·E interaction while B, C, D remain constrained and the full five-way product is small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.62 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B collectively are limited and the five-way product is not large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, C·D is meaningful, A and E do not together dominate, B and D are balanced, and the full five-way interaction is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B leads with supporting B·D interaction while A+E remain restrained, C is not dominant, and higher-order five-way influence is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 — i.e., C, D, E all provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B and the five-way effect are limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (supportive/correction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., C important with A+E supporting, B and D balanced, and the A·C·D interaction meaningful while overall five-way dominance is limited.]

7. [Conflict-resolution rule — if multiple above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute class scores: score1 = 2*(A+E)/S + 3*(A*E)/(S^2) - (B+C+D)/S; score2 = 2*B/S + 2*(B*D)/(S^2) - (A+C+E)/S; score3 = 2*C/S + 2*(C*D)/(S^2) - (A+B+E)/S; score4 = 2*(D+E)/S + 3*(D*E)/(S^2) - (A+B+C)/S. Predict the class with the highest score, but only if that class's five-way normalized product (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04; otherwise predict 4.]

8. [Fallback strict-dominance (only when none above apply) — letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), if P > 0.04 predict 4 (high mixed interaction); else predict the class M with M_score = (M_share) + 0.5*(pairwise strongest interaction involving M)/S where M_share is max(A,B,C,D,E)/S and the pairwise interaction uses the other feature most correlated with that max (e.g., if A max use max(A*B,A*C,A*D,A*E)/(S^2)).]
