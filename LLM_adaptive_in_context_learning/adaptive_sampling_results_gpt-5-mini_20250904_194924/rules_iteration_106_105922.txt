PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 106
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND (A/(B + 1)) >= 1.2 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B is small, C·D is limited, and A is large relative to B.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.60 AND |B - C|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E dominate with a robust C·D·E triple interaction while A·B remains limited and no single A+E takeover.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is weak, and B/E together do not overwhelm C.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A and E remain moderate and A·C·E triple interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A == max(A,B,C,D,E) AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND E/S >= 0.12 — i.e., A is the clear dominant feature but decision requires verifying E support and that the other three together are not jointly strong.]

6. [Fallback multi-feature scoring — compute scores using all five features and predict the class with largest score when none of the above apply: letting S = A + B + C + D + E,
score1 = 1.8*(A + E)/S + 2.5*(A*E)/(S^2) - 1.2*(B/S) - 0.8*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.6*(B*C*D)/(S^3);
score2 = 1.9*(B/S) + 2.1*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A + E)/S - 0.7*(C*E)/(S^2) - 0.5*(A*C*E)/(S^3);
score3 = 1.7*(C/S) + 1.6*(C*D)/(S^2) - 1.0*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.6*(B/S) - 0.4*(A*B*C)/(S^3);
score4 = 1.6*(D + E)/S + 1.8*(C*D*E)/(S^3) - 1.1*(A*B)/(S^2) - 0.5*(A*C)/(S^2);
predict argmax{score1,score2,score3,score4} — i.e., use a composite interaction-based score that simultaneously considers all five features and their pairwise/triple interactions.]
