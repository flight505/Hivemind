PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 159
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND D/S <= 0.36 — i.e., A is a leading contributor with strong pairwise support from B, C and E while D is restrained.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND |B - C|/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E together drive the outcome, their triple interaction with B is nontrivial, C provides substantive support and features are not extremely imbalanced by D.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is dominant with B·D reinforcement while A and E remain limited and the triple A·C·E is small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.26 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.22 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) >= 0.012 — i.e., B-led regime supported by D and moderate balanced A/E, with limited C.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary, C·D interaction meaningful, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

6. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C-driven cases where A and E provide supporting share, the A·C·D triple is meaningful, B and D are reasonably balanced, and B·E is not dominant.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., D and E together dominate with strong D·E interaction while A·B and cross-term C·(A+B) remain limited.]

8. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.62 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.28 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., the trio C,D,E collectively dominate with a meaningful triple interaction while A and B are jointly limited and balanced.]

9. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., D and E provide the decisive support, cross A·C and B·D interactions are limited, and A+B do not collectively overwhelm.]

10. [Fallback consolidated rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and T = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5 + 1), predict 1 when A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.60, predict 2 when B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + C + E)/S <= 0.62, predict 3 when C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B + E)/S <= 0.66, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportions together with pairwise/triple interactions across all five features as a robust final decision rule.]
