PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 99
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.40 AND (A - max(B,C,D))/S >= 0.10 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B is limited, C and D are collectively smaller, and A exceeds the other single features.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (B*(A + E))/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., B is the main contributor supported by a meaningful B·D interaction while A and E together remain constrained and C is not dominant.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a substantive C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not strong.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E and triple C·D·E support while A·B remains limited.]

5. [When two or more pairwise normalized interactions among {A*E, B*D, C*D, B*C, D*E} exceed 0.10 (i.e., (X*Y)/(S^2) >= 0.10 for at least two pairs), resolve by selecting the class tied to the largest pairwise interaction: largest A*E -> predict 1; largest B*D -> predict 2; largest C*D or B*C -> predict 3; largest D*E -> predict 4. Always compute using S = A + B + C + D + E so all five features influence the normalization.]

6. [If a dominant triple interaction is present, use triple-based assignment: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND C/S >= 0.20 AND E/S <= 0.40 then predict 3; if (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.30 then predict 1; if (B*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND B/S >= 0.20 then predict 2 or 4 by whether D*E > A*B (if D*E larger predict 4 else predict 2). These checks use all five features via S and the complementary share constraints.]

7. [Handle mixed-high, nearly-uniform cases by weighted interaction scoring: letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute class scores
   score1 = 1.3*(A + E)/S + 1.8*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.9*(B/S) - 0.6*(C/S) - 0.6*(D/S);
   score2 = 1.4*(B)/S + 1.6*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.7*(A/S) - 0.5*(C/S) - 0.5*(E/S);
   score3 = 1.5*(C)/S + 1.6*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.7*(A/S) - 0.6*(B/S) - 0.4*(E/S);
   score4 = 1.4*(D + E)/S + 1.7*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(A/S) - 0.6*(B/S) - 0.5*(C/S).
   Predict the class with the largest score. Each score formula references A,B,C,D,E and S so all five features are considered.]

8. [Fallback (strict multi-feature threshold) — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute dominance margins mA = (A - (B+C+D+E)/4)/S, mB = (B - (A+C+D+E)/4)/S, mC = (C - (A+B+D+E)/4)/S, mD = (D - (A+B+C+E)/4)/S, mE = (E - (A+B+C+D)/4)/S; if the largest margin >= 0.12 predict the corresponding class (A->1,B->2,C->3,D->4 if E is largest use rule 4 when E pairs strongly with D: require (D+E)/S>=0.40 else map E-dominant to class 1 if (A+E)/S >= 0.40), otherwise use rule 7 scoring to break ties. This fallback enforces comparisons involving all five features.]
