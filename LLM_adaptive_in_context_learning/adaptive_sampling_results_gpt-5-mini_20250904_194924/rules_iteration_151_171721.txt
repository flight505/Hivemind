PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 151
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain relatively small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., D and E lead, C is a meaningful secondary contributor and the D·E and C·D·E interactions are nontrivial.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.42 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is primary, C·D interaction matters, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, at least three of {C/S, D/S, E/S} >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., a three-way C–D–E dominance with low A·B interaction.]

6. [Predict 1 or 2 for cases with both A and B substantial when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND B/S >= 0.28 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.40 AND E/S <= 0.40: if (A*E)/(S^2) >= (B*D)/(S^2) + 0.03 then predict 1 else predict 2 — i.e., break ties between high A and B by comparing cross-feature supports involving the other features.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + C + D)/S >= 0.55 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND E/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C-led situations where A and D provide strong supporting interaction with C and B is balanced with D.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (B + C + D + E)/S <= 0.70, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + C + D + E)/S <= 0.70, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B + D + E)/S <= 0.70, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion but require contextual checks involving all five features.]
