PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 95
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND P5 <= 0.015 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, C and D are small, B is modest relative to A+E, and the full-five-product is low (so dominance is concentrated in A and E).]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), B/S >= 0.32 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND P5 <= 0.020 — i.e., B is the principal contributor reinforced by a B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is not large, and the full-five interaction remains limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND P5 <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the main driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E and full-five-product are not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND P5 >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited and the five-way product is non-negligible (supporting multi-feature coupling around D/E/C).]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND P5 >= 0.009 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantial shares, their triple interaction is material, A·B is low, and the five-way product is consistent with multi-feature support.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND P5 <= 0.030 — i.e., C is important with A+E giving supporting share, B and D reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and the full-five product does not indicate uniform large values across all five.]

7. [Corrective rule for A-dominant ambiguity: Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), A/S >= 0.28 AND B/S >= 0.20 AND (B/A) >= 0.45 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 AND P5 <= 0.020 — i.e., although A is large, a substantial relative B plus a B·D interaction shifts the outcome toward class 2 when A·E is not strong and the five-way product remains limited.]

8. [Tie-breaker multi-interaction fallback: If none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), compute dominance scores DA = (A + 0.5*E + 0.3*(A*E)/S)/S, DB = (B + 0.4*D + 0.25*(B*D)/S)/S, DC = (C + 0.35*D + 0.25*(C*D)/S)/S, DD = (D + 0.4*E + 0.25*(D*E)/S)/S, DE = (E + 0.3*A + 0.2*(C*E)/S)/S; then predict the class corresponding to the largest score among {DA->1, DB->2, DC->3, max(DD,DE)->4} provided the chosen score >= 0.28 and P5 is used to nudge ties (if P5 >= 0.02 prefer class 4, if P5 <= 0.01 prefer class 1) — i.e., resolve ambiguous cases by combined weighted dominance of all five features and their key pairwise interactions.]
