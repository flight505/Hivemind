PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 130
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C and D remain limited and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.12 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a meaningful D·E interaction, C provides substantive support, and the A·B pair is weak.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a solid C·D interaction, A·E is small, B and D are balanced, and A+B are restrained.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads the sum supported by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate and the triple A·C·E remains limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary multi-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E all contribute materially with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary interaction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide balanced support, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Correct for high-global-magnitude conflicts (fallback complex) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and V = (A*B + B*C + C*D + D*E + A*E)/(S^2), if none of the above rules apply then: predict 1 when A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12; predict 2 when B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08; predict 3 when C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12; otherwise predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.34 AND V >= 0.10 — i.e., use a composite of normalized sums and pairwise interactions across all five features to resolve high-magnitude conflicts.]
