PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 98
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and the B·C·D triple are limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B is the primary contributor supported by a meaningful B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain restrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C leads, C·D is substantial, A·E is small, B and D are relatively balanced and A+B are not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.15 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E interaction while A·B and the A·B·C triple are limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.35 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with a nontrivial triple interaction and A·B remains low and not highly skewed.]

6. [Predict 3 (supporting pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important supported by A+E, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D triple is meaningful while B is not dominant.]

7. [Resolve mixed-dominance conflicts: when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, the top two features' combined share T = (largest + second_largest)/S is between 0.40 and 0.60 AND the product of those two features divided by S^2 is >= 0.06 AND the remaining three-feature product (product of the three smaller features)/(S^3) <= 0.03, then predict according to which pair includes (A,E)->predict 1, includes (B,D)->predict 2, includes (C,D)->predict 3, includes (D,E)->predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant interacting pair pattern while accounting for the subdued contribution of the other three features.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, compute dominance score for each class that combines single-feature share and a supporting pair interaction: Score1 = A/S + (A*E)/(S^2), Score2 = B/S + (B*D)/(S^2), Score3 = C/S + (C*D)/(S^2), Score4 = (D + E)/(S) + (D*E)/(S^2); predict the class with the highest Score provided that its Score exceeds the next highest by at least 0.04, otherwise predict the class whose dominant feature M satisfies M/S >= 0.28 — i.e., use combined single-share plus pair-interaction scoring across all five features as a robust fallback.]
