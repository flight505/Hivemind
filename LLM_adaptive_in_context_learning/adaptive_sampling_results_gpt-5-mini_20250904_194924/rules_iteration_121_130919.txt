PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 121
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.26 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·B·E support, C and D are constrained, and the full five-way signal is present.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.085 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.0012 — i.e., B is the primary driver reinforced by A·D support while C·E and the full five-way magnitude remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0006 — i.e., C is dominant with meaningful C·D interaction, A and E are restrained, B and D balanced, and the five-way pattern supports class 3.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0009 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B remain limited and the global five-way signal favors class 4.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0007 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with a strong triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.54 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.002 — i.e., A is the single largest contributor with meaningful A·E interaction and the remaining features do not overwhelm the A/E signal.]

7. [Fallback conflict-resolution rule — if multiple rules apply or none apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and define scores: score1 = 2*(A+E)/S + (A*B*E)/(S^3) - (C+D)/S; score2 = 2*(B)/S + (B*(A+D))/(S^2) - (C+E)/S; score3 = 2*(C)/S + (C*D)/(S^2) - (A+E)/S; score4 = 2*(D+E)/S + (D*E)/(S^2) - (A+B)/S; choose prediction = argmax{score1,score2,score3,score4} provided the corresponding (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0003 else choose the class whose single-feature proportion (M/S) is >= 0.30 where M = max(A,B,C,D,E) — i.e., resolve overlaps by multivariate score that uses all five inputs.]
