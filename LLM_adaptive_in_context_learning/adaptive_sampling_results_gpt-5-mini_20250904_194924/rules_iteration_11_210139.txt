PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 11
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND ((C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 OR (D*E)/((A*B)+1) >= 0.70) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.25 AND C/S >= 0.08 — i.e., D and/or E strongly dominate the total, the triple C·D·E or the D·E pair is large even after accounting for A·B, A·B remains relatively small, and C provides at least a minimal supporting share.]

2. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, max(D,E)/S >= 0.22 AND (D+E)/S >= 0.34 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (C/(A + B + 1)) >= 0.10 AND (A*B* C)/(S^3) <= 0.15 — i.e., one of D or E is individually substantial, D+E together are a clear plurality, A and B are not dominant, C is non-negligible, and high-order A·B·C interaction is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, A+E provide supporting share, the A·C·D interaction is meaningfully large, B and D are reasonably balanced, and B is not excessively large alone.]

4. [Predict 3 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (C* (A + E))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08 AND (D+E)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C together with A+E drives the outcome, B·D interaction is limited, high-order A·B·E interaction is small, and D+E do not overwhelm.]

5. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C is small, D is modest, B is not large relative to A+E, and the A·E pair is a meaningful reinforcing interaction.]

6. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B and D together provide a moderate-to-strong share without A+E dominating, C is not the primary driver, high-order A·B·E interaction is limited, and C with A/B does not overwhelm.]

7. [Predict 2 (tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.15 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.35 — i.e., B and D jointly form the strongest reinforcing pair, A·E is weak, C is not dominant, and A and E are not highly imbalanced.]

8. [Fallback nuanced rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = {pA=(A* (E + C))/(S^2), pB=(B*(D + A))/(S^2), pC=(C*(A + D))/(S^2), pD=(D*(B + E))/(S^2), pE=(E*(C + B))/(S^2)}; predict the class corresponding to argmax{pA,pB,pC,pD,pE} with a minimum margin requirement argmax value >= 1.05 * second highest, otherwise predict the class of argmax{A,B,C,D,E} — i.e., use pairwise reinforced contributions across all five features to decide, and fall back to single-feature plurality only when reinforced signals are ambiguous.]
