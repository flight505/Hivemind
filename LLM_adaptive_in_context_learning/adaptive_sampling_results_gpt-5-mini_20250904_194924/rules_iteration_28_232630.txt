PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 28
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B + C)/S >= 0.65 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) >= 0.080 AND E/S <= 0.14 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.22 — i.e., the top three features A,B,C collectively dominate and have a strong triple interaction while E is small, A and B are balanced, and D is limited.]

2. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D/S) <= 0.25 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction supported by B·C, D not excessive, and all five features contribute non-negligibly to the overall pattern.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.38 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND A/S <= 0.18 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.035 AND |C - D|/S <= 0.36 — i.e., B is the leading contributor with a meaningful B·D interaction, A is small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and C and D are not extremely divergent.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0015 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a substantial C·D interaction, A and B are collectively restrained, A·E is not dominant, and all five features participate in the global interaction.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and A·B interactions remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is meaningful, A·B is low, and all five features jointly inform the pattern.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0012 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction is significant, and every feature contributes to the global interaction.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 and (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.08, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 and (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.08, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion together with multiplicative constraints that involve all five features to avoid single-feature-only decisions.]
