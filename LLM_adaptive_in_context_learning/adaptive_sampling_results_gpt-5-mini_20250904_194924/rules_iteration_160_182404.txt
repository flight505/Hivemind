PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 160
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.25 AND (A*(B + E))/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., A is the primary driver, the joint A·(B+E) support is strong, C and D are not dominant, and the mid-range product B·C·D remains limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.012 — i.e., D and E interact strongly, B·D provides additional support, A and C are not collectively dominant, and the C·D·E triple interaction is nontrivial.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is the main contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B together are restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E does not dominate.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Correct high-total cases: Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), S >= 350 AND A/S >= 0.18 AND (A*(B + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND P >= 0.0008 AND (C/S) <= 0.30 — i.e., for very large total magnitude where A remains a leading contributor and the normalized full-product shows coordinated high features with moderate C, choose 1.]

8. [Fallback dominant-with-balance rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.29 AND P <= 0.03, predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.29 AND P <= 0.03, predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.29 AND P <= 0.03, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant feature proportion together with the normalized full-product to avoid misclassifying highly balanced high-magnitude cases.]
