PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 36
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.52 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D are relatively limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A and E remain restrained and the A·C·E triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A·E interaction is weak.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C contributions are limited.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.40 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., the triple C·D·E interaction drives class 3 while A and B remain relatively low and balanced.]

6. [Ambiguity-resolution rule: let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(B*D)/(S^2), P3=(C*D)/(S^2), P4=(D*E)/(S^2); if max{P1,P2,P3,P4} >= 0.06 AND (A + B + C + D + E) == S, then predict 1 if P1 is max, predict 2 if P2 is max, predict 3 if P3 is max, predict 4 if P4 is max — i.e., choose the class whose pairwise normalized interaction among the five features is strongest.]

7. [Fallback dominant-product rule: let S = A + B + C + D + E and P_all = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); if max(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.30 AND P_all <= 0.020 then predict the class corresponding to argmax{A,B,C,D,E} (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D/E pair disambiguated by D vs E product dominance) — i.e., when one feature dominates and the overall five-way interaction is small, pick the dominant feature's class.]

8. [Tie-break and regularization rule: let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized pair-sum scores S1=(A+E)/S, S2=(B+D)/S, S3=C/S, S4=(D+E)/S; if |S1 - S2|/1 <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.015 then choose the class whose corresponding normalized pair or single score is largest after penalizing by (A*B)/(S^2) and (C*D)/(S^2) (i.e., subtract 0.5*((A*B)/(S^2)+(C*D)/(S^2)) from each score) — this resolves close ties using full five-feature interactions.]
