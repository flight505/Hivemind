PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate, the triple C·D·E interaction is relatively large, and the A·B interaction is small.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND E/S <= 0.36 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, A·C·D product is significant, and neither B nor E are dominant.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.15 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., A and E together strongly dominate, A·E interaction is strong, while B·D is small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B and D supply a substantial middle share, C is not dominant, A+E do not dominate, and A·B·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 2 (secondary condition for B-dominant patterns) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.25 AND A/S <= 0.35 — i.e., B is the principal driver supported by D, while C·E remains limited and A is moderate-to-small.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary condition for multi-high D/E/C) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., C, D and E all contribute materially and their triple interaction favors class 4 while A·B is low.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary condition when C supported by balanced B/D and A+E moderate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND |B - D| <= 0.20 * S AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., C is important, B and D are balanced, A+E provide supporting share, and A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

8. [Predict 1 (secondary condition for strong A/E pairing) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.40 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 — i.e., A is dominant, E strongly supports A, the B·C·D triple is small, and A·E is a strong interaction.]

9. [Fallback composite-score rule — if none of the above apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute class scores using all five features: score1 = A/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B*C*D)/(S^3); score2 = B/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - (A*C*E)/(S^3); score3 = C/S + (A*C*D)/(S^3) - (B*E)/(S^2); score4 = (D + E)/S + (C*D*E)/(S^3) - (A*B)/(S^2). Predict the class with the highest score (ties broken by the larger triple-product term for that class).]
