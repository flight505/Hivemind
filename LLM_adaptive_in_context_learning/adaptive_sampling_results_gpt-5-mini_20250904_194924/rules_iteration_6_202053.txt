PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate, C is a clear supporting contributor, A·B interaction is small, and the full five-way normalized product is not large (so dominance is concentrated in C,D,E).]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND |B - D| <= 0.18 * S AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., C is the primary driver, B and D are balanced, A+E provide measurable support, and mid-order products including A,B,D are nontrivial.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.16 AND D/S <= 0.28 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.070 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are small-to-moderate, B is not large, and the A·E coupling is substantial.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.58 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.065 — i.e., B and D supply a moderate-to-strong share, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the A·B·E triple interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D)/(S^4) <= 0.020 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially while A·B remains low and higher-order A·B·C·D coupling is not dominant.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.085 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and B·E is not overly large.]

7. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.040 — i.e., B and D dominate together, A+E are limited, C is not dominant, and cross-coupling among A,C,E is small.]

8. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*E*B)/(S^3) >= 0.030 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with each contributing materially, C is small, B·D interaction is small, but A·E coupled with some B support is nontrivial.]

9. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., the triple C·D·E normalized interaction is high while A and B together are minor contributors.]

10. [Fallback rule — if none of the above match, let S = A + B + C + D + E and let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.20 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.20 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06; predict 4 if M is D or M is E and max(D,S) or max(E,S) >= 0.20 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.09 — i.e., use the largest contributor but require the remaining four-way product to be sufficiently small so the max truly dominates.]
