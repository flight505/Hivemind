PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 153
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.28 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.003 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited and the full five-way interaction is small.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S >= 0.48 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND A/S <= 0.32 AND E/S <= 0.32 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND |C - E|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.003 — i.e., B (supported by D) is the leading driver while A and E are restrained, the A·C·E triple is small, and no strong simultaneous five-way amplification exists.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.004 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak, A·C·D provides reinforcement, and there is no dominating five-way product.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.003 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and A·B remain limited and no extreme five-way amplification is present.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0007 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, A·B is low, and there is a measurable multi-feature (all-five) contribution supporting a 4 outcome.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0005 — i.e., C is important with A+E providing supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, B is not excessive relative to A+E, and a modest full-feature interaction exists.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (B+C+D+E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005, predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (A+C+D+E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005, predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (A+B+D+E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-share logic but require that the other features collectively still contribute and that the five-way product condition is respected.]
