PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 51
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.32 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 — i.e., A and E together dominate relative to the total while C and D are limited, B is not large relative to A+E, and the A·E interaction is substantial.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C provides meaningful support, while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with important C·D support, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple A·C·E remains limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while the A·B interaction is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05; predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04; predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the dominant feature proportion together with a minimal supporting interaction involving all five features through S).]
