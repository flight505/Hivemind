PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 123
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.45 AND |A - (D + E)|/S >= 0.12 AND (B*D*C)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., A is the clear dominant share, A·E is a strong pairwise interaction, B and C are jointly limited, A is meaningfully larger than the combined D+E or balances them only when its A·E interaction is strong, and the B·D·C triple is small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B remain collectively limited and the A·B·C triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., C is the principal contributor, C·D is a significant support interaction, A and E are not jointly dominant, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·B·E triple is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited.]

5. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*E)/(S^2) >= 1.15 * max((B*D)/(S^2),(C*D)/(S^2),(D*E)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND A/S >= 0.22 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.65 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., the normalized A·E interaction strictly dominates all other pairwise interactions, A has substantial share, other features are collectively not dominating, and the full five-way product is not extreme.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |C - D|/S <= 0.18 — i.e., C, D and E jointly form a nontrivial triple interaction with D+E share high while A·B remains low and C and D are not wildly imbalanced.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C supported by D/E together dominates, A and B are limited, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not a competing strong interaction.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B*D)/(S^2) >= 1.05 * max((A*E)/(S^2),(C*D)/(S^2),(D*E)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND B/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., the normalized B·D interaction dominates pairwise alternatives, B has notable share, A+E are not jointly dominant, C is moderate-to-small, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing normalized pairwise interactions P_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), P_BD=(B*D)/(S^2), P_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), P_DE=(D*E)/(S^2), P_AB=(A*B)/(S^2), predict 1 if P_AE = max{P_AE,P_BD,P_CD,P_DE,P_AB} AND A/S >= 0.20, predict 2 if P_BD = max{...} AND B/S >= 0.20, predict 3 if P_CD = max{...} AND C/S >= 0.20, otherwise predict 4 (tie-breakers require the corresponding feature share >= 0.20 and all comparisons use the full S to ensure all five features are considered).]
