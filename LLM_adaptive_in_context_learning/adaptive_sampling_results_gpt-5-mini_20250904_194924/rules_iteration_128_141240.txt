PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 128
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B + E)/S >= 0.62 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.10 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND |C - D|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A, B and E together overwhelmingly dominate, their triple interaction is strong, C and D are jointly limited, and C and D are not wildly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B is the main driver supported by a B·D interaction while A and E are collectively restrained, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple cross-term A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.27 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 0 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and E provide limited support, the A·B·E interaction is small, and B and D are relatively balanced.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.09 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND |A - C|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong C·D·E triple interaction while A·B remains low and A and C are not extremely different.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple product is nontrivial while A·B and A+B remain limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) >= 0.02 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.50 — i.e., C is important, A and E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and a four-way interaction among A, C, D, E is meaningful while B is not overpowering.]

7. [Predict 1 when a high-A structural pattern exists despite mixed others: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.10 AND (A/(B + C + D + E + 1)) >= 0.30 AND |B - E|/S <= 0.45 — i.e., A is the dominant single contributor with reinforcing A·E interaction while the combined product of the other three is limited.]

8. [Fallback generalized decision when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.12; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.12; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.12; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature proportion but require a limiting multi-feature product that involves all five variables to avoid over-relying on a single feature.]
