PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 96
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND (A - max(B,C,D,E))/S >= 0.08 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, their interaction is substantial, C and B are relatively restrained, and A is clearly ahead of every other single feature.]

2. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0009 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 — i.e., A is the dominant contributor even when all five features contribute nontrivially, with a supporting A·E interaction.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B leads, supported by a B·D interaction, while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary, C·D is meaningful, A and B collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C >= max(A,B,D,E) AND C/S >= 0.26 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 — i.e., C is the single largest feature, its C·D interaction contributes nontrivially, A+E provide moderate support, and A·B stays limited.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.125 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C is not oversized, A·B is small, and the C·D·E triple is meaningfully large.]

7. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D, E together supply the bulk of the mass with a nontrivial triple interaction while A and B stay limited.]

8. [Fallback scoring rule (apply only if none of the above conditions fire): let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute four class scores that combine all five features:
   score1 = 0.60*(A + E)/S + 0.40*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.30*(B + C + D)/S;
   score2 = 0.60*(B)/S + 0.40*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.30*(A + C + E)/S;
   score3 = 0.60*(C)/S + 0.40*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.30*(A + B + E)/S;
   score4 = 0.60*(D + E)/S + 0.40*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.30*(A + B + C)/S;
   Predict the class with the largest score (ties broken by the largest single-feature proportion). This enforces a decision that always integrates all five features mathematically.]
