PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 64
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate the total, their multiplicative interaction is strong, and B, C, D remain secondary.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.36 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B are limited and C contributes noticeably.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is the clear leader with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A+E are not dominant, and A·B remains small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple are limited and C is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 1 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D*E*B)/(S^3) <= 0.025 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*(B + C + D + E))/S^2 >= 0.18 — i.e., A and E jointly strong with low disruptive three-way interaction from D·E·B, C small, and A sufficiently influential across the remaining features.]

6. [Predict 4 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (D*(A + B + C + E))/S^2 >= 0.16 — i.e., D and E dominate, the triple C·D·E is meaningful, A·B is small, and D exerts a broad influence across the other features.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (B*(A + C + D + E))/S^2 <= 0.20 — i.e., C is important, the A·C·D triple interaction is significant, B and D are balanced, A+E provide supporting share, and B's broad influence is limited.]

8. [Fallback consolidated decision when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A and (A*(B + C + D + E))/S^2 >= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.28; predict 2 if M is B and (B*(A + C + D + E))/S^2 >= 0.18 AND B/S >= 0.28; predict 3 if M is C and (C*(A + B + D + E))/S^2 >= 0.18 AND C/S >= 0.28; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-feature interactions with the rest of the features to break ties).]
