PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 86
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction, C is limited, B·D is small, and the normalized full-product is not excessive.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and the overall five-way normalized product remain constrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, A+B are restrained, B and D are balanced, and the five-way normalized product is moderate.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B leads as the single contributor supported by B·D, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the normalized five-way product is limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.15 AND B/S >= 0.18 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.008 — i.e., many features are substantively large but A and E still provide the decisive A·E interaction while the full five-way interaction is also nontrivial.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.009 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares, their triple interaction is meaningful, A·B is small, and the normalized five-way product confirms multi-feature reinforcement toward class 4.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., C is important with balanced B and D and supporting A/E, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful while the full five-way product remains moderate.]

8. [Predict 2 (correction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.18 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND E/S >= 0.40 AND D/S <= 0.18 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.09 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., a strong B·E partnership with very large E and limited A·C favors class 2 despite other moderate contributions.]

9. [Predict 4 (correction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND C/S >= 0.22 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.006 — i.e., D+E plus C jointly form a multiway reinforcement toward class 4 while A·B remains low.]

10. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., require dominance thresholds and a five-way normalized-product check to use single-feature dominance).]
