PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 70
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.040 AND A/S <= 0.18 AND (B/(S)) >= 0.12 — i.e., C and E together provide substantial share with a meaningful C·E interaction while A is relatively small and B is non-negligible.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly drive the case with a notable A·E interaction while B, C, D do not overwhelm.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.030 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a B·D interaction, A+E remain limited, and the triple A·B·E is small.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND A/S <= 0.25 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E dominate with a substantial D·E interaction while C and A are not dominant.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.070 AND (A + B + E)/S >= 0.12 — i.e., C is primary with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is limited, and the remaining features collectively contribute modestly.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, and the A·B interaction is weak.]

7. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.030 AND B/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., A and E jointly important with a measurable A·E product while cross interactions that would favor other labels are limited.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.30, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.30, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.30, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant-feature decision but require the whole five-feature context via S and complementary-share checks.]
