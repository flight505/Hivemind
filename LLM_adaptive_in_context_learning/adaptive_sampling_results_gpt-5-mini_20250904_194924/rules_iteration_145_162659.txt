PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 145
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.65 AND ((C*D + D*E + C*E)/(S^2)) >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.40 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., the triad C,D,E collectively dominates with strong pairwise C·D/C·E/D·E interactions while A·B remains weak and A,B are not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate and interact substantially while the B·C·D triple is limited and C is not dominant.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., C is the primary share with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, A·E small, and B,D reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·A or B·D interactions while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.45 — i.e., D and E dominate but C provides a nontrivial supporting share through a triple interaction while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + C + D)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (B)/(S) <= 0.35 — i.e., C is important, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, B is not overwhelming, and B and D remain reasonably balanced.]

7. [Fallback composite decision rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute composite scores that use all five features:
   score1 = (A*E)/(S^2) * (A + E)/S - (B*C*D)/(S^3)
   score2 = (B)/(S) * (B*(A + D))/(S^2) - (C*E)/(S^2)
   score3 = (C)/(S) * (C*D)/(S^2) - (A*B*E)/(S^3)
   score4 = (D + E)/S * (D*E)/(S^2) + C/S - (A*B)/(S^2)
   Predict the class corresponding to the largest score (1 if score1 is largest, 2 if score2 is largest, 3 if score3 is largest, 4 if score4 is largest) — i.e., choose the label whose normalized interaction-driven composite (involving all five features) is strongest.]
