PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 52
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND D/S >= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.004 — i.e., A is a strong contributor with a substantial A·E interaction, the triple A·B·C support is nontrivial, D provides supporting share, and the five-way product indicates multiple high features favoring class 1.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 — i.e., A with E jointly dominate while A·B and A·C·D interactions exist and the remainder features are sufficiently engaged to indicate class 1 rather than class 4.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*B*C*D)/(S^4) <= 0.015 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by B·D, A·E is limited, C is not dominant, and the higher-order product remains small consistent with class 2.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., C dominates with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A+E are not overly large, and the five-way product is not so large as to indicate a different multi-feature pattern.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.020 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E, C is not too large, A·B is limited and the overall five-way intensity is moderate, indicating class 4.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/(S) <= 0.50 — i.e., triad C-D-E provides substantial shared mass and interaction while A·B and A+B remain limited, favoring class 4.]

7. [Predict 3 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important with an A·C·D interaction, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, and cross-support from B·E is limited, indicating class 3.]

8. [Fallback multi-feature decision when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(B*D)/(S^2), P3=(C*D)/(S^2), P4=(D*E)/(S^2): if max{P1,P2,P3,P4} == P1 and A/S >= 0.18 then predict 1; if max{P1,P2,P3,P4} == P2 and B/S >= 0.26 then predict 2; if max{P1,P2,P3,P4} == P3 and C/S >= 0.28 then predict 3; if max{P1,P2,P3,P4} == P4 and (D+E)/S >= 0.38 then predict 4 — i.e., use the strongest normalized pairwise interaction together with each feature's share to decide, requiring all five features via S and the pairwise products.]
