PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 150
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.32 AND B/(A + E + 1) <= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, C and D are comparatively small, B is not large versus A+E, the A·E synergy is substantial, and the full five-way product is small (so dominance comes from A/E rather than all variables being large).]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E and C supports to form a C·D·E synergy, while A·B remains limited and the overall multi-way product indicates multiple contributors (not a single-feature outlier).]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D reasonably balanced, A·E not dominant, and the full-product small so C-driven pattern is primary.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not jointly dominate, C is moderate-to-small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and the full five-way product is not large (so class 2 is driven by B/D structure).]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is nontrivial, A·B remains low, and the overall product confirms multiple strong contributors consistent with class 4.]

6. [Predict 3 (supportive-interaction) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.040 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share but do not dominate, B and D reasonably balanced, the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful, and the five-way product is not so large as to indicate an all-features-elevated case.]

7. [Resolve close/conflicted cases by computing normalized synergy scores for each class using all five features: let S = A + B + C + D + E and define
score1 = ((A*E)/(S^2)) * ((A + E)/S) - 0.5*(B + C + D)/S + 2*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
score2 = ((B*D)/(S^2)) * (B/S) - 0.5*(A + C + E)/S + 2*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
score3 = ((C*D)/(S^2)) * (C/S) - 0.5*(A + B + E)/S + 2*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
score4 = ((D*E)/(S^2)) * ((D + E)/S) - 0.5*(A + B + C)/S + 2*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5).
If the largest score exceeds the second-largest by >= 0.03 predict the corresponding class; this tie-breaker uses all five features (via S and the five-way product) and balances pairwise synergies against the rest of the variables.]

8. [Fallback (balanced-distribution rule) — if none of the above conditions apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute weighted composite scores using all five features:
s1 = 0.45*(A + E)/S + 0.25*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*(B + C + D)/S + 0.30*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
s2 = 0.45*(B + D)/S + 0.25*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + C + E)/S + 0.30*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
s3 = 0.50*(C + D)/S + 0.20*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + B + E)/S + 0.30*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
s4 = 0.45*(D + E)/S + 0.25*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + B + C)/S + 0.30*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5).
Predict the class with the largest s-score. This fallback always uses all five inputs and combines sums, pairwise products, and the full five-way product to capture complex interdependencies.]
