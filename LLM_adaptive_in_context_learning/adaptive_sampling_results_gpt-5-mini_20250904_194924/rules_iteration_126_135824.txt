PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 126
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., A and E together overwhelmingly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, cross-swing B·D is limited, C is not overly large, and the full five-way amplification is not extreme.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (C*(B + D))/S^2 <= 0.20 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., A is the clear single leader with meaningful support from E, while combined influence from C, B and D is restrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a solid C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A·E influence is limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S >= 0.22 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., C and D jointly dominate (C primary) even if E contributes, while A and B remain collectively lower.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.26 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together are not dominant and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.040 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.30 AND E/S >= 0.22 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.70 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.045 — i.e., D (with E) is the principal force even if A/B/C have nontrivial shares, provided three-way A·B·C amplification is limited.]

8. [Fallback decision rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, then: predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 and (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (A + E)/S <= 0.60; predict 4 if M is D or M is E and (D + E)/S >= 0.44; otherwise predict the label whose component has the largest product interaction with its most supporting partner (max of {A*E, B*D, C*D, D*E, A*B}/S^2).]
