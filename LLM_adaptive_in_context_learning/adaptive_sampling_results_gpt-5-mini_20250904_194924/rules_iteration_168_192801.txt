PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 168
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, C and D are relatively small, B is not large compared to A+E, and the full five-way normalized product remains low.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.02 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., D and E dominate with strong D·E interaction, C contributes substantially, A and B are collectively limited and not extremely imbalanced, and the five-way interaction is nontrivial.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D support, A and B are collectively constrained, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak, and the overall five-way product remains modest.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and the five-way product is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.015 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares, their triple interaction is meaningful, A·B remains low, and the five-way product indicates multi-feature reinforcement.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.012 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and the overall five-way interaction is present.]

7. [Predict 2 (correction for A-dominant but B-supported contexts) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.32 AND B/S >= 0.20 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 AND |C - E|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., A is large but B provides decisive support through B·D, A·E is weak, the five-way product is modest, and C and E are not extremely divergent.]

8. [Predict 1 (correction for E-A cooperative contexts) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.28 AND A/S >= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and E are jointly prominent with nontrivial A·E interaction, B and C together are not dominant, C·D is limited, and the five-way product is not large.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), compute normalized dominance scores DA=A/S, DB=B/S, DC=C/S, DD=D/S, DE=E/S and composite scores:
   S1 = 0.35*(DA + DE) + 0.15*P,
   S2 = 0.35*DB + 0.15*(B*D)/(S^2) + 0.10*P,
   S3 = 0.35*DC + 0.15*(C*D)/(S^2) + 0.10*P,
   S4 = 0.35*(DD + DE) + 0.15*(D*E)/(S^2) + 0.10*P;
   predict argmax among {S1->1, S2->2, S3->3, S4->4} but require the chosen score >= 0.28 otherwise predict the class corresponding to the largest single normalized component among DA, DB, DC, DD, DE — i.e., use a five-feature composite that blends dominance, pairwise interactions and full five-way interaction before falling back to single-feature leadership.]
