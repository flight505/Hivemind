PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 133
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, min(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A*E)/(S^2) + (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + C + D)/S >= 0.50 — i.e., all five features contribute meaningfully (no tiny values), the A·E pair and the B·C pair jointly explain a large share of interactions, A+E are an important paired driver, and the remaining three features together remain substantial (captures "many-high" balanced patterns that map to class 1).]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND min(A,E)/S >= 0.18 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.12 AND (A + E)/(S) >= (B + C + D)/(S) * 0.65 — i.e., A and E form a strong dominant interaction while the triple product of the other three is limited, so the A·E-dominant multi-feature pattern indicates class 1.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND min(D,E)/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.08 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., D and E dominate overall with substantial D·E interaction, the triple C·D·E is nontrivial, and the A·B·C support is small (captures strong tail-end dominance patterns mapping to class 4).]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND max(A,B)/S <= 0.30 AND std_dev([A,B,C,D,E])/S >= 0.18 — i.e., the upper three features C,D,E together create a dominant triple interaction while A and B are limited and the feature spread is moderate-to-high, indicating class 4.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.34 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.18 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., C is clearly primary, A+E are restrained, B and D are balanced and interact meaningfully with C, indicating class 3.]

6. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (B/(A + C + D + E + 1)) >= 0.25 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor with a supporting B·D interaction, A and E are limited and the triple A·C·E is small, indicating class 2.]

7. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B* (A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND min(A,D)/S >= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., B leads with asymmetric support from A or D, C and E are not jointly strong, and the full five-way interaction is low, mapping to class 2.]

8. [Fallback hierarchical decision when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and H = sorted proportions pA=A/S, pB=B/S, pC=C/S, pD=D/S, pE=E/S: if pA + pE >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 predict 1; else if pD + pE >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 predict 4; else if pC >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 predict 3; else if pB >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.06 predict 2; otherwise predict the class corresponding to argmax{pA,pB,pC,pD,pE} (ensuring all five features were considered in the proportional checks).]
