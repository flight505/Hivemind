PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 73
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.125 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and the combined A+B share are restrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the principal contributor, supported by C·D, with A·E not dominant and B and D reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D while A+E and triple A·C·E are limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each have substantial shares and their triple interaction matters while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Predict 1 when A is the clear individual leader but other features are non-negligible: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max(A,B,C,D,E) AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., A is the dominant single feature, reinforced by its interaction with E while the middle three do not jointly overwhelm A.]

8. [Fallback — compute normalized interaction scores using all five features and choose the class with the largest score: letting S = A + B + C + D + E,
Score1 = A/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B*C)/(S^2),
Score2 = B/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - (A*E)/(S^2),
Score3 = C/S + (C*D)/(S^2) - (A*B)/(S^2),
Score4 = (D + E)/S + (D*E)/(S^2) - (A*B)/(S^2);
predict the class with the maximum Score (i.e., use a balanced composite of single-feature share, a reinforcing pairwise interaction, and a penalty for opposing pairwise interactions, so all five inputs determine the outcome).]
