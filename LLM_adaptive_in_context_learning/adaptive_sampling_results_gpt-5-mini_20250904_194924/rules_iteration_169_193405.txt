PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 169
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, their pairwise interaction is strong, B,C,D collectively remain small (all five features considered via S and the triple product).]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.025 — i.e., D and E lead with strong D·E interaction supported by C while A and B are jointly limited (condition involves all five features).]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND ((C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 OR (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.06) AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D or B·C interaction, B and D balanced, and A/E collectively restrained (all five features used via sums/products).]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited (rules reference all five features).]

5. [Predict 4 when C, D and E all contribute substantially: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., a three-way C·D·E interaction dominates while A·B is low (uses all five via S and A·B).]

6. [Predict 1 when A is overwhelmingly dominant but supported by C and E: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A-driven cases where A interacts with C and E while B,D are limited (all five included).]

7. [Predict 3 when mid-level balance between C and supporting partners occurs: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C important with A/E supporting and an A·C·D triple interaction while B·E remains limited (all features present).]

8. [Fallback scoring rule (use when no above rule applies): let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute class scores using all five features: score1 = 0.6*(A + E)/S + 0.4*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.25*(B*C*D)/(S^3); score2 = 0.6*B/S + 0.4*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A*C*E)/(S^3); score3 = 0.55*C/S + 0.25*(C*D + B*C)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A*E)/(S^2); score4 = 0.5*(D + E)/S + 0.45*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A*B)/(S^2). Predict the class with the highest score provided its score exceeds the next highest by at least 0.05; if no score exceeds the next by 0.05 predict 4. (All five features enter every score via S and product terms.)]
