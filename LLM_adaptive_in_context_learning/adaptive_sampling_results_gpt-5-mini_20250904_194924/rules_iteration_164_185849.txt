PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 164
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= max((B*D)/(S^2),(C*D)/(S^2),(D*E)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND B/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND D/S <= 0.36 — i.e., A and E together provide the largest joint interaction relative to all other pairwise interactions while the remaining features (B, C, D) do not collectively outweigh A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= max((A*E)/(S^2),(C*D)/(S^2),(B*D)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND A/S <= 0.40 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.36 — i.e., the D·E pairwise interaction dominates and A,B,C do not together overwhelm the D+E contribution.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= max((A*E)/(S^2),(D*E)/(S^2),(B*D)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a strong C·D interaction, A and B are collectively moderate, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·E interaction is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= max((A*E)/(S^2),(C*D)/(S^2),(D*E)/(S^2),(A*B)/(S^2)) AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads as a single contributor supported by a dominating B·D interaction while A+E and triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Resolve strong-interaction conflicts: if two normalized pairwise interactions are within 0.02 of each other (e.g., |(X*Y)/(S^2) - (U*V)/(S^2)| <= 0.02 for any pairs) then predict the class associated with the pair whose larger single-member has the greater share of S (compare max(X,Y)/S vs max(U,V)/S); require in the decision that the losing pair's complementary features (the three other variables) do not collectively exceed 0.50 of S — i.e., break ties by which interacting pair has the stronger principal contributor while ensuring the rest of the features don't overwhelm the choice.]

6. [Catch cases where a dominant single feature is overruled by multi-feature interactions: if max(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.30 but the largest normalized pairwise interaction not involving the max feature satisfies (pair)/(S^2) >= 1.2 * (maxFeature * secondLargest)/(S^2) AND the sum of the two features in that dominant pair >= 0.34*S, then predict the class tied to that dominant pair (mapping pairs to classes: A·E ->1, B·D->2, C·D->3, D·E->4); require additionally that the three remaining variables collectively have (sum)/S <= 0.50 so all five are considered.]

7. [Predict based on stable triple interactions when pairwise signals are weak: if all normalized pairwise interactions (A*E, B*D, C*D, D*E, A*B) are < 0.08 but a normalized triple interaction (e.g., (C*D*E)/(S^3) or (A*C*D)/(S^3) or (A*B*E)/(S^3)) >= 0.030 AND the sum of the variables in that triple >= 0.36*S while the excluded two variables each <= 0.22*S, then predict the class associated with that triple where mapping is: triple containing (A,E,?) favors 1, containing (B,D,?) favors 2, containing (C, D, ?) favors 3, containing (D,E,?) favors 4.]

8. [Fallback multifeature scoring rule (applies when no earlier rule fires): compute S = A+B+C+D+E and for each class compute a score that uses all five features:
score1 = 1.0*(A+E)/S + 4.0*(A*E)/(S^2) - 1.0*(B+C+D)/S
score2 = 1.0*(B)/S + 3.5*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A+C+E)/S
score3 = 1.0*(C)/S + 3.5*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A+B+E)/S
score4 = 1.0*(D+E)/S + 4.0*(D*E)/(S^2) - 1.0*(A+B+C)/S
Predict the class with the largest score; ties broken by comparing the corresponding dominant pairwise interaction values. This rule always includes all five features in the scoring and resolves remaining ambiguous cases.]
