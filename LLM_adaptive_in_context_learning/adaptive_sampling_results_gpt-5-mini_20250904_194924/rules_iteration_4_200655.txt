PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C / S) >= 0.30 AND ((D + E) / S) >= 0.35 AND (A / S) <= 0.30 AND ((B * C * D) / S^3) >= 0.015 — i.e., C is a clear leader, D+E together are large, A is not dominant, and the B·C·D interaction is appreciable.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D / S) >= 0.32 AND ((B + E) / S) >= 0.28 AND (C / S) <= 0.28 AND ((A * D * E) / S^3) >= 0.012 AND (B / S) >= 0.05 — i.e., D is dominant with substantial B and E support, C is subdued, and the A·D·E triple interaction contributes.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, ((A + B) / S) >= 0.46 AND ((A * B) / S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C / S) <= 0.30 AND (D / S) <= 0.40 AND ((E * A) / S^2) >= 0.03 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate, their product is large, C is not dominant, and E provides modest reinforcement.]

4. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A / S) >= 0.35 AND ((A * D) / S^2) >= 0.07 AND ((B + C + E) / S) <= 0.65 AND ((B * E) / S^2) <= 0.18 AND |C - D|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A is the primary driver with meaningful A·D interaction while the remaining features collectively remain moderate.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, ((B + E) / S) >= 0.40 AND (D / S) >= 0.10 AND (C / S) <= 0.25 AND ((B * E) / S^2) >= 0.06 AND ((A * D) / S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., B and E form the core share, D contributes moderately, C is small, and B·E interaction is meaningful while A·D remains limited.]

6. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, ((B + D) / S) >= 0.34 AND (E / S) >= 0.18 AND (C / S) <= 0.22 AND ((A * B * E) / S^3) <= 0.020 AND |A - D|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B and D together are a stable majority with supportive E, C is small, and extreme A·B·E interaction is not present.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C / S) >= 0.30 AND ((A + E) / S) >= 0.15 AND ((A * C) / S^2) >= 0.06 AND (|B - D| / S) <= 0.25 AND ((B * D * C) / S^3) >= 0.008 — i.e., C is dominant, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and C interacts sufficiently with B and D.]
