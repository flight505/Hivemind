PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 135
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A/(B + C + D + E + 1)) >= 0.18 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., A is the clear single leader with a meaningful A·E support, B·D interaction is limited, and the full five-way interaction is not simultaneously large (so A-driven cases are chosen even when one other feature is moderately large).]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.47 AND (C/(A + B + D + E + 1)) <= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., B is the dominant single contributor with supporting B·D interaction, A+E are not jointly dominant, C is not comparatively large, and the overall five-way product is not large enough to indicate a different multi-feature regime.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B are collectively restrained and B vs D are balanced, and the full five-way interaction does not dominate (so C-driven patterns map to class 3).]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.040 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A is restrained and A·B is limited (true multi-D/E regimes map to class 4).]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.015 — i.e., when C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low, favor the multi-feature class 4 regime.]

6. [Resolve A vs D/E conflict: predict 1 (A) rather than 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.38 AND A/(D + E + 1) >= 0.70 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., if D+E look large but A is proportionally dominant relative to D+E and has meaningful A·E support, prefer class 1 to avoid misclassifying strong-A cases as class 4.]

7. [Resolve B vs 4 conflict: predict 2 (B) rather than 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND B/(D + E + 1) >= 0.60 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., if D+E are moderately large but B remains the working dominant contributor with B·D support and the full five-way product is not large, prefer class 2.]

8. [Tie-break / fallback (all-five check) — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5): compute normalized contributions a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S and M = argmax{a,b,c,d,e}; then predict:
    - 1 if a >= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND P5 <= 0.045;
    - 2 if b >= 0.26 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND P5 <= 0.045;
    - 3 if c >= 0.26 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND P5 <= 0.045;
    - otherwise 4 (i.e., use dominant-proportion rules that still require checks on pairwise support and the full five-way interaction).]
