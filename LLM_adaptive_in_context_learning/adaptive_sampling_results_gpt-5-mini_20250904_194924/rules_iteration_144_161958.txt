PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 144
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and the triple B·C·D are limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and A·B·C remain limited.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E and the triple A·C·E are restrained.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, A+B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.68 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., the trio C,D,E jointly dominate (strong triple interaction) while A·B remains small and the full five-way product is limited.]

6. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., A is the clear leader with supportive E interaction and remaining cross-products small.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is important even when B is large, provided C·D interaction exists, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak, and the A·B·C triple is limited.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C*(A + E))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B drives the outcome supported by interactions with A or D while C with A/E and D·E remain limited.]

9. [Final fallback — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.06, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-feature mapping but require the remaining four-way product to be limited so the dominance is meaningful).]
