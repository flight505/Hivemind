PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 22
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., A and E together dominate the total, C is small, and the B·D interaction is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND ((C/S >= 0.18) + (D/S >= 0.18) + (E/S >= 0.18)) >= 2 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate, at least two of C,D,E contribute substantially, and A·B is relatively small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D| <= 0.20 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, A+E are not dominant, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.55 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate share, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the A·B·E triple interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (high-C supporting) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is meaningful while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (A-dominant tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., A is the single largest contributor, A+E together are large, C is small, and B·D is limited.]

7. [Predict 3 (C-with-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., C is largest, A+E do not overpower, B+D are not overwhelmingly dominant, and the A·B·D interaction is small.]

8. [Predict 2 (B/D-coupled) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B = max{A,B,C,D,E} OR D = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND |B - D| >= 0.10 * S — i.e., one of B or D is the single largest contributor, together B+D give a clear share, A·E is small, C is not dominant, and B and D are not perfectly matched.]

9. [Predict 4 (D/E synergy overrule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C/S >= 0.15 OR (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND (A + E)/(S) <= 0.60 — i.e., D and E synergy is strong, supported by C or C·D interaction, A·B remains limited, preventing misclassification as 1 or 2.]

10. [Fallback general rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P_A=(A* (A+E))/(S^2), P_B=(B*(B+D))/(S^2), P_C=(C*(C+ A))/(S^2), P_D=(D*(D+E))/(S^2), P_E=(E*(E+D))/(S^2); predict the class corresponding to the largest P_X (predict 1 for P_A, 2 for P_B, 3 for P_C, 4 for P_D or P_E) — i.e., use normalized second-order self-plus-partner interactions that incorporate all five features as a robust tie-breaker.]
