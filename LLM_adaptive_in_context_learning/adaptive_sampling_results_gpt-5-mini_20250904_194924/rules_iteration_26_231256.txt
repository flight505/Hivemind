PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 26
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.55 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., the combined mass of C,D,E dominates the total, their triple interaction is strong, and the A·B interaction is relatively weak.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.26 — i.e., A and E together provide a large share and interact strongly, C is small, and the B·D interaction is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND ((B - D)^2)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND E/S <= 0.35 — i.e., C is the principal contributor, B and D are balanced, A·C is appreciable, and E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.35 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.62 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B and D together supply a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C is not dominant, and the triple A·B·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternate pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, min(C/S, D/S, E/S) >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND ((A + B)/(C + D + E)) <= 0.45 — i.e., C, D, and E each contribute substantially while A·B and the A+B share remain comparatively small.]

6. [Predict 3 (alternate pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D| <= 0.28 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide a supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

7. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A/(B + D + 1)) >= 0.60 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (E/(C + 1)) >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.30 — i.e., A is clearly strong relative to the other contributors, C is small, E contributes meaningfully to A, and B·D interaction is not dominant.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (C/(A + B + D + E + 1)) <= 0.28 — i.e., B and D both provide stable shares with a meaningful interaction, A+E do not dominate, and C is relatively smaller compared with the rest.]

9. [Fallback decision (use only if no above rule applies): letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(B*D)/(S^2), P3=(A*C)/(S^2), P4=(C*D*E)/(S^3): if max{A,B,C,D,E}/S >= 0.33 predict the class of that max (A→1,B→2,C→3,D or E→4); otherwise predict 4 if P4 > max(P1,P2,P3), predict 1 if P1 = max(P1,P2,P3), predict 2 if P2 = max(P1,P2,P3), else predict 3 — i.e., use the relative largest single feature when decisive, otherwise use normalized multi-feature interaction strengths.]
