PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 129
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C and D together dominate with a strong C·D interaction while A+E are restrained, B is not dominant, and the triple A·B·E is limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.70 AND min(C/S, D/S, E/S) >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., the three-way C·D·E core dominates (each sizeable and their triple product is nontrivial) while A·B remains limited.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.65 — i.e., A and E together drive the outcome with a strong A·E interaction, while C and D are modest and B is not overwhelmingly larger than A+E.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a meaningful B·D interaction, A+E are restrained, C is not dominant, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND E/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND C/S >= 0.12 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate (strong D·E interaction and E sizeable) with A·B limited and C providing at least a modest supporting share.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (B/(A + D + 1)) <= 0.42 AND E/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C is primary with a meaningful C·D pairwise and A·C·D triple interaction, B is moderate relative to A+D, and E is not dominant.]

7. [Predict 1 (tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.020 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (E/(B + C + 1)) >= 0.10 — i.e., A is the dominant single contributor supported by A·E interaction while B·D is weak and C is limited.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.015, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.015, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.015, predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.01, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature checks only when combined pairwise interactions and all five-feature proportions confirm the dominance.]
