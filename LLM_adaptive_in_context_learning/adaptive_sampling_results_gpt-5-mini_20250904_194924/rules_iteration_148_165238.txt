PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 148
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.25 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain comparatively small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·E, C and B are limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 1 (tie-breaker for A-dominant patterns) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND D/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A is the clear leader with reinforcing interaction with E and non-negligible A·B while C and D are moderate-to-small.]

7. [Fallback predictive rule when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M be the largest of {A,B,C,D,E} and N be the second-largest, predict the class corresponding to M (1 if M is A, 2 if M is B, 3 if M is C, 4 if M is D or E) only if M/S >= 0.28 AND (M*N)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND ((A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5)) <= 0.10; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant feature together with its interaction with the runner-up and the global five-way dispersion as a final decision.]
