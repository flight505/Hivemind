PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 132
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND A/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.12 AND B/S <= 0.34 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while B·C·D remains limited and all five features are considered.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND A/S <= 0.30 — i.e., the upper trio C,D,E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B are not jointly large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D support, A·E does not dominate, and B and D are balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B is the leading contributor reinforced by B·D while A and E remain restrained and triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - (B + C)|/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D and E jointly substantial with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B stays low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND B/S <= 0.34 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Tie-breaker scoring rule (uses all five features) — letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute scores:
   score1 = ((A + E)/S) * ((A*E)/(S^2)) * (1 - B/S) * (1 - C/S) * (1 - D/S);
   score2 = (B/S) * ((B*D)/(S^2)) * (1 - (A + E)/S) * (1 - C/S);
   score3 = (C/S) * ((C*D)/(S^2)) * (1 - (A*E)/(S^2)) * (1 - |B - D|/S);
   score4 = ((C + D + E)/S) * ((D*E)/(S^2)) * (1 - (A*B)/(S^2));
   Predict the class with the largest score (requires evaluating all five features); if the top score < 0.015 predict 4 as conservative fallback.]

8. [Fallback dominance rule — letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 AND (B + C + D)/S >= 0.05, predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A + C + E)/S >= 0.05, predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A + B + E)/S >= 0.05, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., require a dominant feature but only after checking its interactions with the other four features.]
