PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 158
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.32 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, B is small relative to A+E, C and D are limited, and the B·C·D triple is negligible.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.025 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C provides supporting share, and A·B (and A·B·C) remain small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., C is primary with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A+E do not dominate, and A·B·E is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D, A+E are restrained, the A·C·E triple is small, and the five-way normalized product is negligible.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute materially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains small.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide moderate support, B and D are fairly balanced, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and B·E is limited.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict: M's class (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D or E) only if M/S >= 0.28 AND ((product of the other four features)/(S^4)) <= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant normalized feature but require that dominance to be strong and the combined support from the other features to be limited, with the condition involving all five features.]
