PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 79
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND P5 <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C and D remain limited and the overall five-way product is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND A/S <= 0.28 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND P5 >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E dominate with a significant D·E interaction while A is relatively smaller and the multi-feature product indicates multiple substantial contributors.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND P5 <= 0.04 — i.e., C is the primary driver with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak, and overall five-way influence is not extreme.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND P5 <= 0.045 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate and the full-product remains moderate.]

5. [When two competing pairwise interactions are both strong, compute I_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), I_DE=(D*E)/(S^2), I_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), I_BD=(B*D)/(S^2) with S = A + B + C + D + E; predict the class corresponding to the largest interaction if that interaction is at least 1.15× the next-largest interaction AND the associated sum share condition holds: for I_AE require (A+E)/S >= 0.45, for I_DE require (D+E)/S >= 0.40, for I_CD require C/S >= 0.28, for I_BD require B/S >= 0.30; also require P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 to avoid cases where all five are uniformly high.]

6. [Override to predict 1 when A and E individually exceed moderate thresholds relative to S even if another rule would apply: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), A/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND P5 <= 0.05.]

7. [Override to predict 4 when D and E individually exceed moderate thresholds relative to S even if another rule would apply: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), D/S >= 0.26 AND E/S >= 0.26 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND P5 >= 0.008.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized dominance scores DA = (A + (A*E)/(S))/(S), DB = (B + (B*D)/(S))/(S), DC = (C + (C*D)/(S))/(S), DD = (D + (D*E)/(S))/(S), DE = (E + (A*E)/(S))/(S); predict the class whose score among {DA, DB, DC, DD, DE} is maximal only if that maximal score >= 0.28 and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.07, otherwise predict 4 as the conservative default.]
