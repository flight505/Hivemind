PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 78
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, S >= 300 AND ((A*B*C*D)/(S^4) >= 0.002 OR (S/5 >= 60 AND (stddev(A,B,C,D,E)/(S/5)) <= 0.22)) AND (E/S <= 0.35 OR ((A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08)) — i.e., the overall magnitude is very large (high total or high mean) and the four-way A·B·C·D structure or balanced-high profile drives class 1, with E not overturning that pattern.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B together with E is the primary driving pair while A and C remain limited and no large triple A·C·D interaction competes.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., C dominates with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and E remain supportive but not dominant, B and D are reasonably balanced, and cross-product A·B·E is small.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the A·B·C block is weak.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., the triple C·D·E provides the dominant multivariate signal while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B + C + D)/S >= 0.68 AND (A*B*C*D)/(S^4) >= 0.0018 AND (E/S) <= 0.40 AND ((max(A,B,C,D) - min(A,B,C,D))/S) <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., the four-feature block A,B,C,D collectively overwhelms E and their multivariate interaction signals class 1.]

7. [Fallback dominance rule when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 and (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.12 then predict 1; else if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.12 then predict 2; else if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 and (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.10 then predict 3; else if (D + E)/S >= 0.40 and (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 then predict 4; otherwise predict 1.]
