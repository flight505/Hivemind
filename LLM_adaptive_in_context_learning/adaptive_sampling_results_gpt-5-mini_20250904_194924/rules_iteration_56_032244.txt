PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 56
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.12 AND D/S <= 0.22 AND (E/(A + B + 1)) <= 0.45 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate with a strong A·B interaction, C provides moderate support, D is limited, and E is not large relative to A+B.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND A/S <= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the primary driver amplified by B·E, A is relatively small, cross C·D is limited and triple A·C·E is negligible.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.33 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C leads with significant C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND A/S <= 0.22 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E interaction while A and the B·C cluster remain limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND B/S >= 0.18 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., A and E together dominate with strong A·E synergy, B provides modest support, C is not dominant, and B·D interaction is small.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |A - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., C is central supported by an A·C·D triple interaction, B and E collectively restrained, A and D are comparable, and B·E is limited.]

7. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with nontrivial triple interaction while A·B and A+B remain constrained.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting W_A = (A/S) + (A*B)/(S^2) - (C + D)/(2*S), W_B = (B/S) + (B*E)/(S^2) - (A + C)/(2*S), W_C = (C/S) + (C*D)/(S^2) - (A + E)/(2*S), W_D = (D/S) + (D*E)/(S^2) - (B + C)/(2*S), W_E = (E/S) + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B + D)/(2*S), compute W = argmax{W_A,W_B,W_C,W_D,W_E} and predict 1 if W = W_A, predict 2 if W = W_B, predict 3 if W = W_C, predict 4 if W in {W_D,W_E} — i.e., a balanced decision using normalized shares and pairwise interactions across all five features.]
