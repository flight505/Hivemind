PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C * D * E) / (S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND (A * B) / (S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., D and E together are large, C is a meaningful contributor, the triple C·D·E interaction is strong, and A and B are not jointly dominant.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND |B - D| <= 0.18 * S AND (A * C) / (S^2) >= 0.06 AND E/S <= 0.35 AND (A + B + D)/S >= 0.40 — i.e., C is the primary driver, B and D are balanced, A·C interaction is appreciable, E is not dominant, and the remainder supports C.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.15 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B / (A + E + 1)) <= 0.35 AND (A * C * D) / (S^3) <= 0.025 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are small-to-modest, B is small relative to A+E, and cross-interactions with C/D are weak.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A * B * E) / (S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., B (often with D) provides a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C is not dominant, and the triple A·B·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Override to predict 1 when A is clearly dominant even with large D/E: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.12 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (B / (A + 1)) <= 0.50 AND (A * C * D * E) / (S^4) <= 0.02 — i.e., A's dominance and very low C make class 1 most consistent despite large D/E.]

6. [Predict 4 when C, D and E jointly drive the instance: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A * B) / (S^2) <= 0.16 AND (C * D * E) / (S^3) >= 0.028 — i.e., three-way contribution from C, D, E is substantial while A·B remains small.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when C is important and supported by balanced A+E and B~D: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A * C * D) / (S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is the lead, A+E provide support, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

8. [Final multifeature fallback — if none of the above rules apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute four composite scores using all five features: score1 = 0.35*A + 0.10*B + 0.05*C + 0.25*D + 0.25*E; score2 = 0.10*A + 0.40*B + 0.10*C + 0.20*D + 0.20*E; score3 = 0.10*A + 0.10*B + 0.50*C + 0.15*D + 0.15*E; score4 = 0.15*A + 0.10*B + 0.10*C + 0.40*D + 0.40*E. Predict the class with the largest composite score — i.e., use a balanced weighted combination of all five features as a final decision rule.]
