PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 54
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate (strong A·E interaction), C is small, B is not large relative to A+E, and the remaining features do not form a competing triple interaction.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND ((A*E)/(S^2)) <= ((D*E)/(S^2)) + 0.02 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B·C remains limited and D·E is not overtaken by A·E.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is primary, C·D interaction is meaningful, A and B collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together do not dominate and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Resolve strong-interaction conflicts between (A·E) and (D·E) by comparing their normalized interactions: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 then predict 1 if (A*E - D*E)/S >= 0.005, otherwise predict 4 if (D*E - A*E)/S >= 0.005; if their difference is smaller, use rule 8 tie-break scoring — i.e., when both A·E and D·E are large, choose by their relative interaction strength while still normalizing by total S.]

6. [Correct cases where single-feature dominance is misleading by enforcing cross-feature suppression: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if max(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.40 BUT the complementary triple product (product of the other three features)/(S^3) >= 0.04 then downweight the single-feature prediction and instead predict the class whose characteristic pairwise interaction is strongest among {(A*E),(B*D),(C*D),(D*E)} (all normalized by S^2) — i.e., large single features must be overridden when other three-way interactions are substantial.]

7. [Handle B-vs-C tradeoffs: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if B/S in [0.26,0.40] AND C/S in [0.24,0.40] AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= (C*D)/(S^2) + 0.02 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 then predict 2; conversely, if (C*D)/(S^2) >= (B*D)/(S^2) + 0.02 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 then predict 3 — i.e., use the B·D vs C·D interaction gap to decide when B and C shares are comparable.]

8. [Fallback multi-interaction score: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute four normalized scores that use all five features:
    Score1 = ((A + E)/S)*((A*E)/(S^2)) - 0.5*((B + C + D)/S)
    Score2 = (B/S)*((B*D)/(S^2)) - 0.4*((A + C + E)/S)
    Score3 = (C/S)*((C*D)/(S^2)) - 0.4*((A + B + E)/S)
    Score4 = ((D + E)/S)*((D*E)/(S^2)) - 0.4*((A + B + C)/S)
    Predict the class with the highest Score (Score1→1, Score2→2, Score3→3, Score4→4). This tie-break uses all five features, their pairwise/triple interactions, and penalizes competing mass across the other features.]
