PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 80
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., the A–E pair jointly dominates the total share and their normalized product is the strongest interaction while B is relatively limited and the C·D interaction is not overly large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a substantial D·E interaction and the triple C·D·E is meaningfully large while A·B remains comparatively small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+E are not dominating, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·B is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.52 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by its interactions with D and/or E while A+E and the triple A·C·E are not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while the A·B interaction remains low.]

6. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.22 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a clear A·E interaction and neither B nor the C·D or B·D interactions are large enough to override A–E dominance.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important and the A·C·D triple interaction supports class 3 while B–D balance holds and B·E is not dominant.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing normalized pairwise interactions PXY = (X*Y)/(S^2) for all pairs, let Pmax be the largest PXY: predict 1 if Pmax corresponds to A·E and (A + E)/S >= 0.35; predict 4 if Pmax corresponds to D·E and (D + E)/S >= 0.35; predict 3 if Pmax corresponds to C·D or C·A and C/S >= 0.25; predict 2 if Pmax corresponds to B·D or B·E and B/S >= 0.28; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant normalized pairwise interaction together with global share thresholds that involve all five features.]
