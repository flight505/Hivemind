PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + C)/S >= 0.55 AND |A - C|/S <= 0.18 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.18 AND (A * C)/(S^2) >= 0.10 — i.e., A and C together strongly dominate, they are relatively balanced, B and E are small, D is small, and the A·C interaction is substantial.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND E/S <= 0.35 AND A/S is between 0.08 and 0.30 AND (B * D)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND (A/E) is between 0.6 and 1.6 — i.e., B and D form the primary share, C is small, E is not dominant, A is moderate, and the B·D interaction is strong while A and E are comparable.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.36 AND (A + E)/S is between 0.12 and 0.45 AND D/S >= 0.15 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A * C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., C is clearly dominant, A and E provide supporting share, D is a meaningful contributor, B and D are balanced, and A·C is appreciable.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.30 AND (B + E)/S >= 0.38 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND A/S <= 0.25 AND (B * D * E)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND D/C >= 1.20 — i.e., D is large relative to C, B and E together are substantial, C and A are relatively small, and the B·D·E triple interaction is significant.]

5. [Predict 1 when none of rules 2–4 apply but the joint A/C dominance is moderate and B and E are jointly minimal: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + C)/S between 0.45 and 0.55 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.22 AND (A * C)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND D/S <= 0.22 AND |B - D|/S >= 0.20 — i.e., fallback to class 1 when A and C lead moderately, B and E are very small, D is not large, and B vs D are not tightly balanced.]

6. [If multiple rules above fire simultaneously or none fire, compute scores using all five features and choose the class with the highest score where scores are defined as: 
   Score1 = 3*(A+C)/S + 2*(A*C)/(S^2) - 2*(B+E)/S - D/S;
   Score2 = 3*(B+D)/S + 2*(B*D)/(S^2) + 1*(A/E) - 2*C/S;
   Score3 = 3*C/S + 2*(A*C)/(S^2) + 1*D/S - 1*|B-D|/S;
   Score4 = 3*D/S + 2*(B+E)/S + 1*(B*D*E)/(S^3) - 2*C/S;
   then predict the class whose Score is maximal — this tie-breaker uses all five inputs and their interdependent products/ratios.]
