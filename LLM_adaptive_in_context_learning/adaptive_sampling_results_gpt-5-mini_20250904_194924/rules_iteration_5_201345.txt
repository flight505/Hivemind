PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.040 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate the total, the triple interaction C·D·E is large, and the A·B interaction is relatively small.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND |B - D| <= 0.20 * S AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND E/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, B and D are balanced, A·C is appreciable, and E is not dominant.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.15 AND D/S <= 0.25 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C is small, D is modest, and B is not large relative to A+E.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.55 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate share, A and E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple A·B·E interaction is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S is between 0.15 and 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict 1 if M is A, predict 2 if M is B, predict 3 if M is C, predict 4 if M is D or E — i.e., use the feature that singly contributes the largest fraction as a final decision while all five features are used to determine the maximum.]
