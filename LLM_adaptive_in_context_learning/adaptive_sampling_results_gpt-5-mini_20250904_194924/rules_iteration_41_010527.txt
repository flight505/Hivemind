PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 41
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.24 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, their interaction is substantial, B is not large relative to A+E, C and D are restrained, and the overall five-way product is limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and cross-terms with C remain limited and the five-way product is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.014 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is not dominant, and the global five-way product remains modest.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., B leads (possibly supported by B·D), A+E are not dominating, C is moderate-to-small, the A·C·E triple is limited, and the full five-way product is not large.]

5. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B and the full five-way product remain limited, favoring class 3 over class 4 in such balanced C-D-E scenarios.]

6. [Predict 1 (override) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND |C - E|/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., A is the leading single contributor with supportive A·B and A·E interactions while the other features collectively contribute, indicating class 1 when A-centric interactions coexist with non-negligible contributions from all features.]

7. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.28 AND E/S >= 0.28 AND (D*E*C)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0015 — i.e., strong D and E shares combined with a meaningful C contribution push toward class 4 when A and B are relatively smaller but all five features participate in the interaction.]

8. [Predict 2 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.25 AND E/S >= 0.25 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.40 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B and E jointly drive the outcome toward class 2 when A and C are limited, D is not large, and the global five-way product remains moderate-to-small.]

9. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., C is dominant but meaningful support from at least one of A,B,D exists and the five-feature interaction is non-negligible, steering the prediction to class 3.]

10. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), compute the five normalized shares a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S; predict 1 if a >= max{b,c,d,e} AND a >= 0.28 AND P <= 0.03; predict 2 if b >= max{a,c,d,e} AND b >= 0.28 AND P <= 0.03; predict 3 if c >= max{a,b,d,e} AND c >= 0.28 AND P <= 0.03; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., select the dominant normalized share only when supported by the five-way product constraint, otherwise default to class 4).]
