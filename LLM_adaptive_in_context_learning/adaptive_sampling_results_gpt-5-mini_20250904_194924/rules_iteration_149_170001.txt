PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 149
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.32 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are small-to-moderate, the A·E interaction is substantial, B is not large relative to A+E, and the full five-way scale confirms a robust multivariate pattern.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited and the overall five-feature interaction supports class 4.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0005 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, A and B are collectively restrained, C·D interaction is meaningful, B and D are balanced, A·E is not dominant, and the five-way product confirms the pattern.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND ((A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5)) <= 0.0025 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C remains moderate-to-small, the triple A·C·E is limited, and the full five-way interaction does not indicate an alternative class.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0009 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low and the five-way product supports a cooperative C-D-E regime.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND ((B*(A + E))/(S^2)) <= 0.18 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share without dominating, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful, and B relative to A+E is limited.]

7. [Fallback multivariate dominance rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.29 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.08; predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.29 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.08; predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.29 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.08; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., require a clear dominant feature plus constrained joint support from the other four features before assigning the dominant class, otherwise assign class 4 as the cooperative-background class.]
