PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 75
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND A/S >= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.60 AND B/S <= 0.32 — i.e., A and E together provide a dominant share, their pairwise interaction is substantial, while C+D are not collectively overwhelming and B is not large.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B is the main single contributor supported by a B·D interaction, A and E do not jointly dominate, C is limited, and the A·C·E triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the clear leader with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+B are collectively restrained, B and D are relatively balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong interaction while A·B and the A·B·C triple remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., three-way support from C, D and E with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is significant.]

7. [Predict 1 (tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.72 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., A is the single largest contributor, A·E interaction is nontrivial, the rest are not collectively dominant, and the full five-way interaction is not extreme.]

8. [Predict 2 (tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, M is B AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A + C + E)/S <= 0.72 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is dominant with supporting B·D interaction and no extreme five-way dominance.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing normalized contributions a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S, predict the class whose corresponding pairwise-support metric is largest: compute M1 = a*e + a+b - (c+d)*0.5, M2 = b*d + b+a - (c+e)*0.5, M3 = c*d + c - (a+b+e)*0.4, M4 = d*e + d+e - (a+b+c)*0.4; predict 1 if M1 is maximal, 2 if M2 maximal, 3 if M3 maximal, otherwise 4 — i.e., use combined all-five-feature interactions and normalized sums to resolve ambiguous cases.]
