PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 47
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/(A + E + 1) <= 0.40 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C and the C·D interaction are limited and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., D and E together dominate and their pairwise interaction is strong while A·B and the combined A+C support remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+E are not dominant, B and D are relatively balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction supports class 3.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor with a reinforcing B·D interaction while A+E do not dominate and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their three-way interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Disambiguation by dominant pairwise interaction: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and Pxy = (X*Y)/(S^2) for all pairs {X,Y} from {A,B,C,D,E}, compute Pmax = max(Pxy) and P2 = second-largest pair. If Pmax >= 0.06 AND Pmax >= 1.5 * P2 then predict according to the maximizing pair: predict 1 if Pmax = (A*E)/(S^2), predict 2 if Pmax = (B*D)/(S^2), predict 3 if Pmax = (C*D)/(S^2), predict 4 if Pmax = (D*E)/(S^2). This uses all five inputs to choose the class by the strongest inter-feature coupling.]

7. [Fallback dominant-share + interaction check: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A,B,C,D,E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 — i.e., use the dominant feature but require supporting pairwise interactions and the full-sum S to resolve ambiguity.]
