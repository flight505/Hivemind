PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 7
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.010 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate the distribution, their pairwise interaction is strong, the B·D interaction is weak, C is small, and the five-way product is low.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., B and D provide a substantial, mutually reinforcing share, A and E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and higher-order interactions that would pull prediction elsewhere are limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D| <= 0.18 * S AND E/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.005 — i.e., C is the clear primary contributor with a meaningful A·C interaction, B and D are balanced, E is not dominant, and the overall five-way interaction is non-negligible.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.040 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E together dominate while the C·D·E triple interaction is large, A·B remains small, and the overall multivariate interaction supports class 4.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.060 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially, A·B is low, and the five-way product is not so extreme as to indicate a different balanced pattern.]

6. [Tie-break and conflict resolution (use all five features): if multiple class rules apply, compute for each candidate class k a rule-score R_k that multiplies the class-specific dominant interactions used above (e.g., for class1 use (A+E)/S * (A*E)/(S^2) / max( (B*D)/(S^2), 1e-6 ), for class2 use (B+D)/S * (B*D)/(S^2) / max( (A+E)/S, 1e-6 ), for class3 use C/S * (A*C)/(S^2) / max(|B-D|/S, 1e-6), for class4 use (D+E)/S * (C*D*E)/(S^3) / max((A*B)/(S^2), 1e-6) ). Predict the class with the largest R_k — i.e., resolve overlaps by comparing the multivariate interaction strength computed from all five features.]

7. [Fallback rule (applies only if none of the above rules produce a decisive prediction): letting S = A + B + C + D + E and f_A=A/S, f_B=B/S, f_C=C/S, f_D=D/S, f_E=E/S, compute the normalized five-way balance index BIDX = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) and the entropy H = -sum_{X in {f_A,f_B,f_C,f_D,f_E}} X*log(max(X,1e-9)). If H <= 0.85 (low diversity) predict the class with largest f_X; if H > 0.85 (high diversity) predict the class whose canonical interaction score defined in rule 6 is maximal — i.e., use both the distribution shape and the full five-feature interaction to decide.]
