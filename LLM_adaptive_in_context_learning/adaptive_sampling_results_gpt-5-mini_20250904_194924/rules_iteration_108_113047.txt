PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 108
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B and C remain limited and the overall five-way normalized product is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a substantial D·E interaction while A, B and C do not collectively compete.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, B and D are balanced, A·E is not dominant, and there is a minimum level of contribution across all five features.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together remain constrained and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low and five-way dominance is moderate.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction matters, and extreme five-way dominance is absent.]

7. [Correct for high-multi-feature ambiguity: Predict 1 if (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.02 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.38; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.02 AND A/S <= 0.38 AND B/S <= 0.38 — i.e., resolve cases where many features are large by requiring both strong pairwise interaction and a nontrivial baseline across all five features.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict the class corresponding to M (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D or E) only if M/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.08; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature logic but require the decision to be supported by the joint normalized product so all five features influence the fallback.]
