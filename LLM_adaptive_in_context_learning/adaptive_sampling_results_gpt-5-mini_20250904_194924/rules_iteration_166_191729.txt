PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 166
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(D*E + A*E + 1) >= 0.55 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND (C*(A + E))/(S^2) >= 0.03 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction that outweighs any D·E effect while B is not dominant and C provides supporting mass.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.04 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction and A·E is comparatively weak while B and C are not collectively overwhelming.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and A·B·E is not large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (correction for D+E confusion) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.35 AND C/S >= 0.20 AND (A*E*C)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 1.2*(A*E)/(S^2) AND B/S <= 0.50 — i.e., even if D+E are sizable, A·E together with C produce a dominant multi-way interaction that justifies class 1.]

6. [Predict 4 (multi-component signal) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

7. [Predict 2 (rescue from C-dominant misclassifications) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is substantial and its interaction with A or D supports class 2 even when C is moderate but C·D interaction is not dominant.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.72, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.72, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.72, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the dominant feature proportion while requiring thresholds that involve all five features).]
