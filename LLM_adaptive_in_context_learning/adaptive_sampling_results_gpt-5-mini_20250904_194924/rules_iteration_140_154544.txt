PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 140
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.18 AND (A*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.045 AND B/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A is a substantial single contributor, the A·D·E triple interaction is strong, B and C are not overwhelming, and B and D are not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B leads with a supporting B·E interaction, A+E do not dominate overall, the C·D interaction is limited, and the A·C·E triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND ((A*C) + (C*D))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND E/S >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C is the primary driver with meaningful C·A or C·D interactions, B is not dominant, E provides support, and B and D are reasonably balanced.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the A·B pair and C are limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute materially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A and B remain collectively secondary.]

6. [Predict 1/2/3/4 by dominant pairwise interaction when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and computing P_AE = (A*E)/(S^2), P_BD = (B*D)/(S^2), P_CD = (C*D)/(S^2), P_DE = (D*E)/(S^2): if P_AE = max{P_AE,P_BD,P_CD,P_DE} AND P_AE >= 0.06 then predict 1; else if P_BD = max{...} AND P_BD >= 0.06 then predict 2; else if P_CD = max{...} AND P_CD >= 0.07 then predict 3; else if P_DE = max{...} AND P_DE >= 0.10 then predict 4 — i.e., use the largest normalized pairwise interaction (which involves all five values through S) to choose the class when a clear pairwise interaction dominates.]

7. [Fallback — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.18, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.20, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the dominant feature proportion together with cross-feature interaction limits to decide when no stronger multi-feature pattern holds.]
