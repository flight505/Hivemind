PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 87
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + D + E)/S >= 0.62 AND (A*D + A*E + D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.20 AND max(B, C)/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005 — i.e., the A–D–E block jointly dominates with strong pairwise interactions while B and C remain limited and the full five-way product is small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., D and E dominate, C supports them with a notable triple interaction while A and B are jointly limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.008 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and E together are restrained, B and D are balanced, and the overall five-way coupling is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.25 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., B leads with supporting B·D interaction while A and E are balanced, C is limited and higher-order five-way interaction is small.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., a three-way C–D–E balance with nontrivial triple interaction and jointly small A and B.]

6. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E + A*D)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND B/S <= 0.22 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., A is dominant and its interactions with E and D are strong while B and C are small and the full five-way product is limited.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., C is important, A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful, B and E are collectively restrained and B vs D are balanced.]

8. [Conflict-resolution rule — if two or more of the above rules apply, compute four class scores using all five features: score1 = (A*D + A*E + A*B)/(S^2), score2 = (B*D + B*C + A*B)/(S^2), score3 = (C*D + C*E + A*C)/(S^2), score4 = (C*D + D*E + C*E)/(S^2); then predict the class whose score is largest; ties are broken by selecting the class whose leading interaction term has the largest absolute difference from the next competitor, ensuring all five features influence the decision.]
