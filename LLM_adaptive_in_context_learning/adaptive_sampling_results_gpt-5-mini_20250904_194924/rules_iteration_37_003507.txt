PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 37
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and the B·C·D triple remain limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by a B·D interaction while A·C·E triple influence is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is dominant with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A·B·E remains limited.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.12 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction and C contributes enough to support a D/E-led outcome while the A·B·C triple is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Override-to-1 correction when B is large but A+E jointly indicate class 1: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., even with a big B, a substantial A+E pair with strong A·E and limited B·D and global five-way product indicates class 1.]

7. [Prefer 4 when D/E dominance competes with high C but the three-way C·D·E indicates outcome 4: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND |B - D|/S >= 0.18 — i.e., D/E dominance together with a meaningful C·D·E triple and low A·B favors class 4.]

8. [Fallback structured tie-break when none of the above rules apply: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting i = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, let Xi be that max and let YZ be the sum of the next two largest features, predict A->1, B->2, C->3, (D or E)->4 when Xi/S >= 0.34 AND (Xi * YZ)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (product of the remaining two features)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., require a clear dominant feature supported by at least one substantial partner while the smallest pair remain limited before assigning the dominant class.]
