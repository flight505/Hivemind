PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., D and E together dominate, C is a meaningful contributor, the triple C·D·E interaction is strong, A·B interaction is limited, and B and D are not extremely different.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.33 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*(B + D))/(S^2) >= 0.16 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is the primary driver, A and E provide supporting share, the combined B+D support C sufficiently, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·B·E triple is not excessive.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.52 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.45 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C is small, A·E interaction is appreciable, B+D are limited, and B·C·D triple is negligible.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND C/S >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B and D supply a moderate-to-large share while C is moderate, A+E are not dominant, the A·B·E triple is limited, and C·D is not overly dominant.]

5. [Secondary Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.030 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially, the high-value triple among C,D,E is present, and A·B remains low.]

6. [Secondary Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, and B·E is not dominating.]

7. [Conflict-resolution scoring rule (uses all features) — if more than one rule above fires, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute scores:
   score1 = 0.35*(A/S) + 0.25*(E/S) - 0.20*(C/S) - 0.10*(B/S) - 0.10*(D/S);
   score2 = 0.40*(B/S) + 0.30*(D/S) - 0.15*(A/S) - 0.15*(E/S) - 0.10*(C/S);
   score3 = 0.55*(C/S) + 0.20*( (B + D)/S ) - 0.25*( (A + E)/S );
   score4 = 0.30*(D/S) + 0.30*(E/S) + 0.20*(C/S) - 0.20*(A/S) - 0.10*(B/S);
   Predict the class whose score is largest (tie broken by the highest product among A*B, B*C, C*D, D*E, A*E).]

8. [Hard override for strong triple signals — letting S = A + B + C + D + E: if (A*E*B)/(S^3) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.20 then predict 1; if (B*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.09 AND (B + D)/S >= 0.35 AND A/S <= 0.30 then predict 2; if (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.09 AND C/S >= 0.20 then predict 4. These override weaker rules to capture decisive three-way interactions.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute normalized vector V = (A/S, B/S, C/S, D/S, E/S); predict class = argmax{ 0.9*A/S + 0.1*E/S - 0.2*C/S, 0.9*B/S + 0.1*D/S - 0.15*C/S, 1.0*C/S - 0.2*(A+E)/S, 0.6*D/S + 0.6*E/S + 0.2*C/S } (choose the class with the largest value) — i.e., use a composite score that depends on all five features. ]
