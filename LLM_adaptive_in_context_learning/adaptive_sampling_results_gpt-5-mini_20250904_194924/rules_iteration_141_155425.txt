PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 141
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND D/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain limited relative to S.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by a B·D interaction, A+E are restrained, C is not excessive, and no full-five-way dominance exists.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., C is the main contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is not strong, B and D are relatively balanced and A+B are not collectively dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternate pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D, E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction drives the outcome while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 1 (alternate pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., A is overwhelmingly dominant, A·E supports it, and the other features together do not produce competitive interactions.]

7. [Predict 3 (supporting pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Fallback (score-based) — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute four class scores that each use all five features: score1 = 2*(A + E)/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B + C + D)/S; score2 = 2*(B)/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - (A + C + E)/S; score3 = 2*(C)/S + (C*D)/(S^2) - (A + B + E)/S; score4 = 2*(D + E)/S + (D*E)/(S^2) - (A + B + C)/S. Predict the class with the highest score (ties broken by the largest single-feature share A,B,C,D,E).]
