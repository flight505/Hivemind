PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 156
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while the combined B·C·D support is limited and the overall five-way product is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND A/S <= 0.35 AND B/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the A·B·C block is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, A·E is not dominant, B and D are balanced, and the five-way product remains moderate.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.01 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D, while A+E and the triple A·C·E are limited.]

5. [Predict 1 (robust A+E rule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.60 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., even if B is nontrivial, a clear A+E dominance with a substantive A·E interaction should yield class 1.]

6. [Predict 4 (C-D-E cooperative pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary C-support rule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Fallback decision (dominant-interaction fallback) — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.08; predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08; predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.35 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.10; if none of these hold, predict 4 by default. All fallback branches also require (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.03 to ensure the full five-way context is considered.]
