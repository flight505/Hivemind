PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 66
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND A/S >= 0.24 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.90 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.07 — i.e., a substantial A·E interaction with A a clear contributor, C and D not jointly dominant, B not overwhelming relative to A+E, and the triple B·C·D small.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND A/S >= 0.20 AND B/S >= 0.20 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 — i.e., A and B jointly strong with limited C and limited D·E, and a supporting A·E term.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the primary driver amplified by B·E, while A+E do not jointly dominate and C·D and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C leads with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+E are moderate, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A+C and A·B remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., three-way strength in C,D,E with nontrivial triple interaction and limited A·B and A·E contributions.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D balanced, the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful, and B·E is limited.]

8. [Correct edge-class conflicts by predicting 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, max(A,B)/S >= 0.24 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (C + D + E)/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E + B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., when top two contributors are A and B with their interaction strong, the remainder present but not jointly overpowering, and cross-pair support exists toward class 1.]

9. [Fallback tie-breaker — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 and (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 and (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 and (A*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 and (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 (ensuring every decision uses sums and cross-feature products involving all five features).]
