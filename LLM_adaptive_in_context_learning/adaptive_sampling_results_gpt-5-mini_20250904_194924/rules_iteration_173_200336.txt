PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 173
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND E/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND B/S <= 0.33 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND D/S <= 0.50 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a significant D·E interaction and A/B/C are not overwhelming.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is primary, C·D is meaningful, B and D are balanced, and cross-products involving A are limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., B leads and is supported by B·D while A/E and A·C·E remain subdued.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute materially and their triple interaction drives class 4 while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C important with supporting A+E, balanced B/D, and a meaningful A·C·D interaction.]

7. [Fallback (tie-break) rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.09; else predict 2 if B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06; else predict 3 if C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportions but require compound interactions and constraints involving all five features.]
