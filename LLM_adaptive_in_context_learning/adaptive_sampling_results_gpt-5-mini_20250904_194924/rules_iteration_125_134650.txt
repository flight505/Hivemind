PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 125
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate with a strong A·B interaction, C is limited, A·E provides supporting interaction, and the C·D·E triple is small.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.25 AND (A*(B + E))/(S^2) >= 0.18 AND (C + D)/S <= 0.40 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.01 — i.e., A is the primary driver supported by B+E, C and D are jointly restrained, B·D is not dominant, and higher-order interactions are limited.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) >= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is the clear leader with a meaningful B·D support, B is large relative to A+E, C is not dominant, and the A·C·E triple is small.]

4. [Predict 2 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND A/S <= 0.20 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.002 — i.e., B leads while A is subdued, B·E provides support, C·D is limited, and no large five-way interaction exists.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is dominant with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·E is not overpowering, and A+B remain moderate.]

6. [Predict 3 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.02 — i.e., C drives the outcome with supporting A+E and a significant A·C·D interaction while B·D remains limited.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C is not dominant, and A·B interaction remains small.]

8. [Predict 4 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B is limited.]

9. [Fallback composite scoring (use when none of the above rules apply): letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute four scores that each combine all five features:
   score1 = 1.2*(A + B)/S + 0.8*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.6*(C + D)/S,
   score2 = 1.2*(B)/S + 0.9*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.5*(A + E)/S,
   score3 = 1.2*(C)/S + 0.9*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.4*(A*E)/(S^2),
   score4 = 1.2*(D + E)/S + 0.9*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.5*(A + B)/S;
   predict the class with the largest score — i.e., choose argmax{score1, score2, score3, score4}, ensuring every decision uses interdependent combinations of all five features.]
