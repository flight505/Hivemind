PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 9
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 when (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.16 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E together strongly dominate while C is small, B and D do not together overwhelm, and the A·E interaction is substantial.]

2. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND C/S >= 0.12 — i.e., D and E dominate the mass, the triple interaction C·D·E is meaningful, and A and B are relatively small.]

3. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND |B - D| <= 0.22 * S AND E/S <= 0.32 AND (A + C)/S >= 0.36 — i.e., C is the principal contributor, A·C interaction is appreciable, B and D are balanced, and E is not dominant.]

4. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 2 when (B + D)/S >= 0.32 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.58 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.058 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B and D jointly provide a moderate-to-large share while A+E and C remain limited and the A·B·E triple interaction is small.]

5. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 (secondary condition) when C/S >= 0.24 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E all contribute substantially while the A·B interaction and A+E share remain limited.]

6. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 (secondary condition) when C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.028 AND B/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is nontrivial.]

7. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. If none of the above apply compute normalized contributions a=A/S, b=B/S, c=C/S, d=D/S, e=E/S; compute class scores using all five features: score1 = (a + e) * ((a*e) + 0.01) / (b + c + d + 0.01); score2 = (b + d) * ((b*d) + 0.01) / (a + c + e + 0.01); score3 = c * ((a*c + c*d) + 0.01) / (a + b + d + e + 0.01); score4 = (d + e) * ((c*d*e) + 0.01) / (a + b + 0.01). Predict the class with the highest score — i.e., a final decision that combines sum- and product-based interactions across all five features.]
