PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 46
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A is the clear leader, the A·E interaction is strong, the disruptive B·D interaction is limited, C is small, and B and D are not highly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (B*(C + D))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A and E together dominate and their pairwise effect is meaningful while cross-terms with B,C,D remain small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a notable C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor reinforced by B·D, while A and E together do not dominate and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.47 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., C, D, and E each contribute substantially, their triple interaction is nontrivial, and A·B and A+B are not dominant.]

7. [Fallback scoring rule (use if none of the above match): let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute four composite scores that use all five features:
   Score1 = 1.6*(A/S) + 1.1*(A*E/S^2) - 0.9*(B*D/S^2) - 0.7*(C/S);
   Score2 = 1.7*(B/S) + 1.1*(B*D/S^2) - 0.9*(A*E/S^2) - 0.6*(C/S);
   Score3 = 1.5*(C/S) + 1.2*(C*D/S^2) - 0.8*(A*B/S^2) - 0.6*(A*E/S^2);
   Score4 = 1.6*((D + E)/S) + 1.3*(D*E/S^2) - 0.9*(A*B/S^2) - 0.6*(C/S).
   Predict the class with the highest Score (requires all five features via S and interaction terms).]
