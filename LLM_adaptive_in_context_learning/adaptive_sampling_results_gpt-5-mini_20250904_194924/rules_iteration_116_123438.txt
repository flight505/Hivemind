PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 116
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited, considering all five features together.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C are constrained, with all five inputs considered.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D balanced and A·E limited, using all five features.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited, accounting for all five inputs.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0007 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low, with all five features included.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., C important with A+E supporting, B and D reasonably balanced and a meaningful A·C·D interaction, using all five inputs.]

7. [Resolve D/E vs A/E conflicts toward 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.9*(D*E)/(S^2) AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.028 — i.e., when both A+E and D+E are large but the A·E interaction is at least as strong as D·E and the A-side triple interactions are limited, prefer 1 while considering all five features.]

8. [Resolve B-dominant ambiguity toward 4 when B and D support D/E dominance: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND A/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., even with substantial B, if B co-occurs with high C and the D+E block is strong the outcome shifts to 4, using all five features.]

9. [Fallback complex-dominance rule when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting P = (A*E)/(S^2), Q = (B*D)/(S^2), R = (C*D)/(S^2), T = (D*E)/(S^2), U = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5): predict 1 if P = max{P,Q,R,T} AND (A + E)/S >= 0.30 AND U <= 0.04; predict 2 if Q = max{P,Q,R,T} AND B/S >= 0.26 AND U <= 0.05; predict 3 if R = max{P,Q,R,T} AND C/S >= 0.26 AND U <= 0.05; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use the largest normalized pairwise interaction among A·E, B·D, C·D, D·E together with normalized full-product checks so all five features influence the decision).]
