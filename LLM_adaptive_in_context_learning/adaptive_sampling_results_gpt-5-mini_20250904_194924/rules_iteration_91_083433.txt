PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 91
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.24 AND C/S <= 0.26 AND D/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.004 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain constrained and the full five-way product is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.002 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A, B, C are limited but the joint scale of all features supports a D/E outcome.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, A and E are restrained, B and D are balanced, and the full five-way product is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D, with A+E limited, C moderate-to-small, and the five-way interaction not large.]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0015 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B remains low and the global joint scale supports a combined C/D/E outcome.]

6. [Predict 1 (A/E preference) in close A vs B contests when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND B/S >= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= (B*D)/(S^2) AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.005 — i.e., when A and B are both large but A·E interaction exceeds B·D and the remainder features do not elevate the global five-way product.]

7. [Predict 3 (C-preference tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND E/S <= 0.40 AND |A - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.006 — i.e., C is significant and its interaction with A and D favors a C outcome while B and E are limited and the full five-way product remains modest.]

8. [Fallback dominant-interaction rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = { (A*E)/(S^2), (B*D)/(S^2), (C*D)/(S^2), (D*E)/(S^2), (A*B)/(S^2) }, predict the label corresponding to the feature-pair with the largest value in P (map pairs to labels: A·E -> 1, B·D -> 2, C·D -> 3, D·E -> 4, A·B -> tie-break to 1) ONLY if that pair's value >= 0.06 AND the five-way normalized product (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.008; otherwise predict the single largest feature M where M/S >= 0.30 (map M=A->1,B->2,C->3,D->4,E->4).]
