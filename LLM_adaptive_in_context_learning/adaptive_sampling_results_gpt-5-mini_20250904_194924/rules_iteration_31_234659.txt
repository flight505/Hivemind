PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 31
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND D/S <= 0.20 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 — i.e., A and B jointly dominate with a strong A·B interaction while D is small, the cross C·E effect is limited, and A·E provides a supporting interaction.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B is the primary driver with a meaningful B·D interaction while A·B remains limited and A+E and C do not dominate.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND E/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C is an important contributor with a substantive C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·B is not dominant, and E is not overwhelmingly large.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A+B remain constrained and C and A·E interactions are limited.]

5. [Predict 3 (override for high-E edge cases) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND A/S >= 0.10 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., even when E is large, a substantive C·E interaction combined with moderate A and weak B·D favors class 3.]

6. [Predict 1 (tie-break for A/B contested cases) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + B)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E + B*C)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND D/S <= 0.25 AND |C - E|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and B together are strong with nontrivial cross-interactions with C and E, D is limited, and C and E are not extremely imbalanced.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and for each class define its supporting interaction: class1_support = (A*B)/(S^2), class2_support = (B*D)/(S^2), class3_support = (C*D)/(S^2), class4_support = (D*E)/(S^2). Predict the class with the largest support value provided that the corresponding feature sum fraction ((A+B)/S, (B)/S, (C)/S, (D+E)/S respectively) is >= 0.28; otherwise predict 4.]
