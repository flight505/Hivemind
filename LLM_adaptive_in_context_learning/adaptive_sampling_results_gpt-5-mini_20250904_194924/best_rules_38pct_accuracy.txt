PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + C)/S >= 0.48 AND D/S <= 0.20 AND (B * E)/S^2 <= 0.08 — i.e., A and C together dominate the total while D is modest and the cross-interaction of B and E is small.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S is between 0.25 and 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (A/E) < 1.2 AND (A * B)/S^2 <= 0.10 — i.e., B and D form a moderate share, C is small, A is not large relative to E, and A·B remains low.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.35 AND (A + E)/S is between 0.15 and 0.40 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A * C)/(S^2) >= 0.08 — i.e., C is the dominant contributor, A and E provide a supporting share, B and D are balanced, and A·C is appreciable.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.30 AND (B + E)/S >= 0.25 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND A/S <= 0.20 AND (B * D * E)/S^3 >= 0.02 — i.e., D is large, B and E together are substantial, C and A are relatively small, and the triple interaction B·D·E is significant.]
