PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 157
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND D/S <= 0.45 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., A is the primary driver with a meaningful A·E interaction, B provides supporting share, C and D are restrained, and the A·B·C triple is limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND (C*(A + D))/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., B leads supported by B·D interaction while A+E remain limited, C is moderate-to-small, and cross-products that would indicate other classes are low.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., C is dominant with a substantive C·D interaction, A+B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E or other cross-triples are not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction and C amplifies D+E while A·B and A·C remain limited.]

5. [Secondary predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A/(S)) <= 0.30 — i.e., three-way C·D·E support indicates class 4 even if no single feature overwhelmingly dominates.]

6. [Secondary predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E and a meaningful A·C·D triple while B·E remains small.]

7. [Resolve A-vs-4 ambiguity: predict 1 rather than 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.24 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.30 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 implies conflict but (A*E)/(S^2) - (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.01 AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., when both A and D+E are large use the relative A·E advantage and restrained C to pick class 1.]

8. [Fallback multi-feature tie-breaker: if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and scores = {s1 = 0.6*(A/S) + 0.4*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.3*(C/S), s2 = 0.6*(B/S) + 0.4*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.3*(E/S), s3 = 0.6*(C/S) + 0.4*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.3*(A/S), s4 = 0.6*((D+E)/S) + 0.4*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.3*(B/S)} then predict argmax over {1,2,3,4} using these scores (this tie-breaker always uses all five inputs through S and mixed products).]
