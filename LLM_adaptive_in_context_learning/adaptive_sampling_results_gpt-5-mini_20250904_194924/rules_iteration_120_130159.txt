PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 120
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., B is the principal contributor supported by B·D, A and E are jointly restrained and the triple A·C·E is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.02 — i.e., C leads, C·D interaction is meaningful, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.56 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the rest remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (mixture rule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D, E jointly substantial with a nontrivial triple interaction while A and B are low.]

6. [Predict 3 (supportive-combination rule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D balanced, and A·C·D interaction meaningful.]

7. [Conflict-resolution rule: if multiple above conditions hold simultaneously, let score1 = (A*E)/(S^2) + (A + E)/S, score2 = (B*D)/(S^2) + B/S, score3 = (C*D)/(S^2) + C/S, score4 = (D*E)/(S^2) + (D + E)/S; predict the class with the highest score among {score1→1, score2→2, score3→3, score4→4} provided that the chosen score exceeds the next-highest by at least 0.03*S/S (i.e., absolute margin 0.03); otherwise apply the fallback rule below. This uses all five features via S and products to resolve competing interactions.]

8. [Fallback rule (requires all five features): if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict class corresponding to M only if M/S >= 0.28 AND (product of the other four features)/(S^4) <= 0.03; otherwise predict 4. This ensures a dominant feature wins only when the remaining four jointly are sufficiently small, otherwise the mixed/high D–E outcome (class 4) is chosen.]
