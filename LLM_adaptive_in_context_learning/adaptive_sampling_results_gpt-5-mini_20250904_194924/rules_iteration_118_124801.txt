PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 118
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*(B + E))/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND A/S >= 0.16 AND (D*E)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (B*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A acts as the central hub through strong A·(B+E) interaction while D·E and the triple B·D·E remain limited and C is not dominant.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.14 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) stay small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is primary, C·(A+D) is meaningful, B and D are balanced, A·E is limited, and B+E do not collectively overwhelm C.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*(A + E))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads supported by B·(A+E) interaction while C and C·D stay moderate-to-small.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 — i.e., C, D, and E all contribute substantially and their triple interaction dominates while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and A·C·D interaction is significant.]

7. [Predict 1 when the strongest normalized pairwise interaction is A·E: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P_AE = A*E, P_DE = D*E, P_BD = B*D, P_CD = C*D, P_AB = A*B, if P_AE = max{P_AE,P_DE,P_BD,P_CD,P_AB} AND P_AE/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.25 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.10 THEN predict 1 — i.e., A·E dominates pairwise structure while B·C is weak.]

8. [Predict 4 when the strongest normalized pairwise interaction is D·E: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P_AE = A*E, P_DE = D*E, P_BD = B*D, P_CD = C*D, P_AB = A*B, if P_DE = max{P_AE,P_DE,P_BD,P_CD,P_AB} AND P_DE/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 THEN predict 4 — i.e., D·E is the dominant pairwise driver.]

9. [Fallback general rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E} and T = max{A, B, C, D, E}/S, predict 1 if M is A and T >= 0.28 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.020, predict 2 if M is B and T >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.020, predict 3 if M is C and T >= 0.28 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.020, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportion together with a constraint on the complementary four-way interaction to require all five features be considered.]
