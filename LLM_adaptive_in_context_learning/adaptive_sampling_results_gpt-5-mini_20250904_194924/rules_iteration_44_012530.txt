PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 44
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, the joint A-dominance pair is strongest: max{A*B, A*E}/S^2 >= 0.055 AND A/S >= 0.15 AND (B + E)/S >= 0.25 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - E|/S <= 0.40 — i.e., either A·B or A·E is the dominant interaction, A has a solid share, the supporting partners B and E collectively contribute, C·D is weak, and B vs E are not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B is the primary driver with reinforcing cross-support from D: B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (C/S) <= 0.40 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor, B·D is the key interaction, A and E together do not dominate, the triple A·C·E is limited, and C is not dominant.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C-driven pairwise interaction dominates: (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S >= 0.27 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the main contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, the D–E engine is dominant and not outcompeted by any C-driven interaction: (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (C*D)/(S^2) < (D*E)/(S^2) + 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C/S) <= 0.35 — i.e., D and E together provide a large share with a strong D·E interaction, C·D is not stronger than D·E, A·B is limited, and C is not excessive.]

5. [When pairwise interactions conflict, use dominant pair comparator: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and Pxy = (X*Y)/(S^2) for every pair, predict according to the largest Pxy (ties broken by larger individual share): if argmax Pxy is A*B or A*E then predict 1; if argmax Pxy is B*D or B*E then predict 2; if argmax Pxy is C*D or C*E then predict 3; if argmax Pxy is D*E then predict 4 — provided that that dominant Pxy exceeds the next-largest P by at least 0.01 and each rule only applies if the corresponding individual feature shares (A/S, B/S, C/S, D/S, E/S) for the pair are both >= 0.12.]

6. [Catch-all balance rule for mixed-high cases: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and V = variance{A/S, B/S, C/S, D/S, E/S}, if V <= 0.015 (features nearly balanced) then predict 4 when (D + E)/S is within the top two component sums and (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.012; otherwise use rule 5 — i.e., for near-uniform distributions prefer the D/E/C aggregate unless a clear pairwise winner exists.]

7. [Fallback dominance-with-thresholds: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and (A*max(B,E))/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06; predict 2 if M is B and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50; predict 3 if M is C and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.36 — i.e., require combined checks across all five features and pairwise interactions before falling back to single-max decisions.]
