PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 94
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND A/S >= 0.16 AND E/S >= 0.12 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND ((A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 OR (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.020) — i.e., A and E jointly dominate even when the full-vector product is elevated or C is nontrivial, so the A–E pattern wins.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND A/S >= 0.24 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.14 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.20 — i.e., A is the clear single leader but the full 5‑feature context limits competing multi-feature interactions.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.14 AND A/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the product of A,B,C remains limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D support, B and D balanced, and cross A·E is not dominant.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., B leads with B·D support while A+E and triple A·C·E remain limited.]

6. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.34 AND A/S >= 0.16 AND B/S >= 0.15 AND (C + D)/S >= 0.20 — i.e., the entire vector is elevated but A and E still provide the decisive co‑peak when the full 5‑way product is high.]

7. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., a robust three‑way C–D–E regime overrides small A·B interaction.]

8. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide moderate support, B and D balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is decisive.]

9. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A + C + E)/S <= 0.60 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.045 — i.e., B leads but strong cross‑products don't contradict a B‑driven signal.]

10. [Fallback composite scoring rule — when none of the above strict patterns apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute class scores that use all five features and their interactions: score1 = 2*(A + E)/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - 0.8*(B + C)/S + (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); score2 = 1.9*(B)/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - 0.7*(A + E)/S + (A*C*E)/(S^3); score3 = 2.0*(C)/S + (C*D)/(S^2) - 0.6*(A*E)/(S^2) + (A*C*D)/(S^3); score4 = 1.8*(D + E)/S + (D*E)/(S^2) - 0.5*(A*B)/(S^2) + (C*D*E)/(S^3). Predict the class with the highest score — i.e., resolve ambiguous multi‑feature cases by an all‑features interaction score.]
