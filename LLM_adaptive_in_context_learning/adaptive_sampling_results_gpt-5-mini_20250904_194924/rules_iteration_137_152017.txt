PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 137
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.23 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND E/S >= 0.12 — i.e., A is a clear leader whose pairwise synergies with C and D are substantial while B is not dominant and E provides a supporting share.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + C)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B leads and forms meaningful interactions with D and E while A and C together remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with substantive interactions with D and E while A and B are not jointly dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while the combined influence of A,B,C is limited.]

5. [Tie-breaker by dominant three-way synergy: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and T1 = (A*C*D)/(S^3), T2 = (B*D*E)/(S^3), T3 = (A*C*E)/(S^3), T4 = (C*D*E)/(S^3); if none of rules 1–4 apply and max{T1,T2,T3,T4} >= 0.020 then predict 1 if T1 is maximal, predict 2 if T2 is maximal, predict 3 if T3 is maximal, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., choose the class whose characteristic three-way interaction among all five features is strongest).]

6. [High-entropy multi-feature resolution: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and V = (A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + D^2 + E^2)/S^2 and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5); if none of rules 1–5 apply and V <= 0.22 and P >= 0.0008 then predict 3 if C/S >= 0.22, else predict 2 if B/S >= 0.22, else predict 1 if A/S >= 0.22, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., in balanced/high-interaction cases use normalized variance and the five-way product to pick the modestly leading feature).]

7. [Fallback composite rule: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and L1 = (A*(C + D))/(S^2), L2 = (B*(D + E))/(S^2), L3 = (C*(A + E))/(S^2), L4 = ((D + E)*(A + B))/(S^2); if none of rules 1–6 apply then predict the class with the largest Li provided that Li >= 0.08; if no Li meets 0.08, predict 4 (i.e., choose the class whose cross-feature composite score — using all five inputs — is largest, with a conservative default to class 4).]
