PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 117
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.32 AND D/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a strong A·E interaction, B and D are not large, and the five-way product is low (not an even balanced mix).]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.06 AND A/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.020 — i.e., D and E dominate with substantive support from C (strong C·D·E interaction) while A remains limited and the five-way product shows multi-feature support.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.045 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A+E are not dominant, and the overall five-way product is not too large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor with B·D support, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate, and the five-way product remains limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.015 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares with a meaningful triple interaction while A·B is low, and the five-way product indicates multi-feature support.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and overall five-way product remains controlled.]

7. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), predict 1 when A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND P <= 0.06; predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND P <= 0.06; predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND P <= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-feature thresholds only when supported by pairwise interaction and constrained by the global five-way product).]
