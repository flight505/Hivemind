PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 163
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.38 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are relatively small, B is not large relative to A+E, and the A·E interaction is substantial.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is a primary contributor, A and B are collectively restrained, C·D is meaningful, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominating.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 when (composite C–D–E consensus), letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (|A - B|/S) <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B stays low and A/B are not extremely imbalanced.]

6. [Predict 3 when (supporting C–A–D interaction), letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful while B is not dominant.]

7. [Resolve B-vs-A ambiguity (predict 1 vs 2) when features conflict: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if B/S >= 0.28 AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= (B*D)/(S^2) + 0.01 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.40 then predict 1 — i.e., when A and B are both large but A·E interaction exceeds B·D and A+E together dominate, favor class 1.]

8. [Resolve B-dominant tie-break (predict 2 vs others) when B strong but ambiguous: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, if B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= (A*E)/(S^2) - 0.01 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (C/(S)) <= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.008 then predict 2 — i.e., B dominance reinforced by B·D interaction and overall cross-product small.]

9. [Fallback dominant-interaction rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and for every label compute its two-feature supporting score (score1 = (A*E)/(S^2) for label 1, score2 = (B*D)/(S^2) for label 2, score3 = (C*D)/(S^2) for label 3, score4 = (D*E)/(S^2) for label 4) then predict the label with the largest score among those whose primary feature proportion (A/S for label1, B/S for label2, C/S for label3, D/S or E/S for label4) is at least 0.18; if no label meets the 0.18 threshold, predict 4.]
