PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 53
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.0012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction, C is not dominant, B is not large relative to A+E, and the five-way normalized product is not large (so class‑1 arises from A/E dominance rather than all features being high).]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A + B + C)/S <= 0.56 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0006 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, the ABC group is limited, and there is at least moderate multi-feature support for a D/E-driven outcome.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.0010 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, A·E not dominant, and the five-way product not large.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.0015 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by a B·D interaction while A+E and the full five-feature product remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low, favoring a multi-feature D/E/C outcome.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.0012 — i.e., C is important with supporting A/E share, B and D balanced, and a significant A·C·D interaction without an overly large five-way product.]

7. [When none of rules 1–6 apply, compute four class scores (each formula uses all five features) and predict argmax(score): let S = A + B + C + D + E and
   score1 = 0.48*(A + E)/S + 0.52*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.30*(C + B)/S + 0.10*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
   score2 = 0.50*(B)/S + 0.40*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + E)/S + 0.10*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
   score3 = 0.55*(C)/S + 0.35*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A*E)/(S^2) + 0.10*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
   score4 = 0.50*(D + E)/S + 0.40*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.25*(A + B + C)/S + 0.10*(A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5);
   predict the class with the largest score (i.e., use weighted, interdependent combinations of all five features as a general tie-breaker).]

8. [Fallback — if scores in rule 7 are within 0.02 of each other, let S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict the class corresponding to M only if M/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.002, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., require a clear dominant feature and moderate five-way product; when ambiguous, prefer the multi-feature D/E outcome).]
