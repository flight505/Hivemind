PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 84
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.34 — i.e., the A+E pair dominates the total, their interaction is strong, and B, C, D are relatively limited.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.33 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., B is the principal contributor reinforced by B·D interaction, A+E are not dominant, C is modest, and the five-way magnitude is not simultaneously large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary driver with meaningful C·D support, B and D are reasonably balanced, A+E are not jointly dominant, and cross-products with A/B/E are limited.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND min(A,B,C,D,E)/S <= 0.14 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C is not large and at least one feature remains small.]

5. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND B/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND D/S <= 0.46 — i.e., A is the clear single leader supported by nontrivial A·E interaction and no other feature is comparably dominant.]

6. [Predict 4 (edge-case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A + B)/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E are large and C also contributes meaningfully so the triple D·E·C interaction plus moderate A+B mass indicates class 4 even when several features are elevated.]

7. [Predict 3 (support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., C is important with A+E providing specific support, B and D balanced, the A·C·D triple is significant while B·E is limited.]

8. [Fallback-general rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting R = (A*B + B*C + C*D + D*E + E*A)/(S^2) and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND R <= 0.40; predict 2 if B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND R <= 0.45; predict 3 if C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use normalized dominance, pairwise-product structure R, and interactions that involve all five features to decide when primary rules do not match.]
