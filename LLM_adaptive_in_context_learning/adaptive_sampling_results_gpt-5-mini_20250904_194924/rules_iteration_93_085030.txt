PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 93
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.50 AND D/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.018 — i.e., A is a clear leader with a meaningful A·E interaction, B+C are not jointly dominant, D is limited, and the full five-way product is not exceptionally large (so A-driven patterns prevail).]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B is dominant supported by a B·D interaction, A+E are not jointly dominant, C is moderate, and the five-way product is modest (so B-centered structure holds).]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., C is the principal contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, A+B remain restrained, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the full-product is not extreme (so C-driven pattern holds).]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.010 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A+B are limited and the overall five-way activity is not vanishing (supports a D/E-driven outcome).]

5. [Predict 1 when there is multi-feature crowding but A still leads: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND A/S >= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.035 AND (C + D + B)/S >= 0.50 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.007 — i.e., in high-total situations where many features are large, prefer 1 only if A is the largest and the A·E interaction is nontrivial while the full five-way product indicates broad elevation.]

6. [Predict 3 (override) when C is dominant but D and E also contribute: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.26 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.009 — i.e., when C leads and the triple C·D·E interaction is meaningful while A and B are limited, choose 3 even if D+E are sizable. ]

7. [Predict 4 (override) when the lower two features jointly pull weight against a single leader: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.38 AND (C/(A + B + 1)) <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.012 AND |A - max(B,C)|/S <= 0.18 — i.e., D+E together overpower an otherwise ambiguous leader and the five-way product confirms multi-feature support for 4.]

8. [Predict 2 (tie-break) when B is leading but A and E jointly moderate and full-feature spread is low: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B = max{A,B,C,D,E} AND B/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.04 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 AND C/S <= 0.40 — i.e., favor 2 when B leads, A+E give supporting but not dominating share, and global five-way activity is modest.]

9. [Fallback complex decision rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), compute leader L = argmax{A,B,C,D,E} and leader share Ls = max{A,B,C,D,E}/S; then (a) if Ls >= 0.29 AND (L*complement_sum)/(S^2) >= 0.035 where complement_sum = S - L, predict according to leader (A->1, B->2, C->3, D->4, E->4 for D/E ties); (b) otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND P5 >= 0.008; (c) otherwise predict 3 if C/S >= 0.24 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055; (d) otherwise predict the label of the feature with maximal normalized pairwise interaction (choose argmax over { (A*E),(B*D),(C*D),(D*E),(A*B) } normalized by S^2).]
