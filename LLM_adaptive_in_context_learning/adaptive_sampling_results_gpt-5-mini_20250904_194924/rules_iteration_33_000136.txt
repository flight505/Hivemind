PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 33
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (B*(C + D))/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited in joint effect.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*B)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E interaction while A·B and triple interactions involving A, B, C are small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D support, A and B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.34 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads as the primary contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and triple A·C·E remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/(C + D + E + 1) <= 0.55 — i.e., the trio C,D,E each contributes sizable shares with a nontrivial triple interaction while A·B and (A+B) relative share are limited.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary pattern) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*(A + E))/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful while cross-effects from B are limited.]

7. [Predict 1 (capture high-A edge cases) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.32 AND (A*(E + B))/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A is clearly dominant with reinforcing interaction with E or B while the joint influence of B,C,D remains small.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.02; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.02; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.02; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportion but require that the other four features do not jointly produce a strong multi-way interaction.]
