PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 161
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.55 AND C/S >= 0.12 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.10 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.02 — i.e., D and E dominate numerically but A and B are negligible while C provides a nontrivial supporting interaction with D+E, so outcome is 3.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., three-way dominance of C, D and E with a meaningful triple interaction and limited A·B support indicates class 4.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a strong C·D interaction, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.43 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited, indicating class 4.]

5. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.22 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.04 AND C/S <= 0.22 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a substantial A·E interaction and limited B, C and B·D support, indicating class 1.]

6. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by B·D while A+E and three-way A·C·E influence are limited, indicating class 2.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., C is important and the three-way A·C·D interaction (with moderate A+E support and balanced B/D) favors class 3.]

8. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (C*D + D*E + C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., combined high mass in C,D,E with strong pairwise interactions among them and limited A·B/A+B support indicates class 4.]

9. [Fallback — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 AND (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.01, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.01, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.01, otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant-share decision but require the other four-feature product to be consistently small).]
