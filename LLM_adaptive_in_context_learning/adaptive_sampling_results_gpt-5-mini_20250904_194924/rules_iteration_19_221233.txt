PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.045 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E together dominate, C is a strong third contributor, the C·D·E triple interaction is substantial, and the A·B pair is small.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate, C and D are limited, B is not large relative to A+E, and the A·E interaction is meaningful.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + C + D)/S >= 0.55 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (B*C)/(S^2) >= 0.04 — i.e., C is the primary driver supported by A and D, B and D are balanced, A·E is small, and B·C provides moderate support.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.35 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.65 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., B and D jointly dominate a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C and E are limited, and the A·B·D interaction is present but C·E is not strong.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (C + D + E)/S >= 0.60 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.05 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., the combined mass of C, D and E dominates while A and B are relatively small and not strongly interacting.]

6. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.42 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND (B/(C + D + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., A is singularly dominant and reinforced by a nontrivial A·B·E interaction while C and D are limited.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND E/S <= 0.25 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C leads, E is not large, A and B together are moderate, the A·C·D triple interaction is present, and B and D are not highly imbalanced.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.36 AND D/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is dominant with meaningful D support, A+E and C are limited, the B·D pair is strong, and the A·C·E triple is weak.]

9. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (E/S) >= 0.35 AND (D/S) >= 0.20 AND (C/S) >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.04 — i.e., E is a dominant single contributor with strong D and C support, while A·B remains low and the C·D·E interaction is meaningful.]

10. [Fallback — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P1 = (A + E)/S, P2 = (B + D)/S, P3 = C/S, P4 = (D + E + C)/S with tie-breakers using triple interactions (A*B*E, A*C*D, C*D*E)/(S^3): predict 1 if P1 is maximal among P1,P2,P3 and (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= max((A*C*D),(C*D*E))/(S^3); predict 2 if P2 is maximal and (A*B*D)/(S^3) >= max(...); predict 3 if P3 is maximal and (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= max(...); otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use combined pair/triple shares of all five features to break ties and make a final decision.]
