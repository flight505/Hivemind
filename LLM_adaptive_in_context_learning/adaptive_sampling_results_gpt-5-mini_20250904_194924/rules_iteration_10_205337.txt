PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.030 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.60 — i.e., D and E together are a large share, the C·D·E triple interaction is meaningful, A·B interaction is small, and A and E are not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*C + C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08 — i.e., C is the dominant contributor, A·C and C·D support C’s dominance, B and E together do not dominate, B and D are balanced, and the A·B·E triple effect is limited.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.52 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*B*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and E together strongly dominate, A·E interaction is substantial, C is small, B·D is limited, and the C·B·D triple is negligible.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND C/S >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.55 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate-to-large share, C is moderate, A+E do not dominate, the A·B·E triple is limited, and A vs E is not extreme.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (B/(A+E+1)) <= 0.60 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially, their triple interaction is meaningful, A·B is small, and B is not disproportionately large relative to A+E.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.025 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is important with supporting A+E, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, and B·E is limited.]

7. [Predict 1 when none of the strong class-3 or class-4 conditions apply but (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.02 — i.e., fallback toward class 1 when A+E are clearly dominant, C is small, A·E is appreciable, cross interactions involving B·D or C·D·E are limited.]

8. [Tie-break / final composite score (applies when multiple rules overlap): compute S = A + B + C + D + E and the four class scores:
    Score1 = 1.0*(A+E)/S + 0.8*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.6*(C/S) - 0.5*(B*D)/(S^2)
    Score2 = 1.0*(B+D)/S + 0.6*(C/S) - 0.5*(A+E)/S - 0.4*(A*B*E)/(S^3)
    Score3 = 1.2*(C/S) + 0.6*(A*C + C*D)/(S^2) - 0.5*(B+E)/S - 0.4*(A*B)/(S^2)
    Score4 = 1.1*(D+E)/S + 0.9*(C*D*E)/(S^3) - 0.6*(A*B)/(S^2) - 0.4*(A+E)/S
    Predict the class with the highest score. Each score uses all five features via the S normalization and at least one product or sum term involving every feature set to resolve complex overlaps.]
