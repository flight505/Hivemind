PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 23
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - C|/S <= 0.35 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate while the C·D·E triple interaction is strong, A·B interaction is weak, and A and C are not extremely divergent.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.52 AND C/S <= 0.15 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.35 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C is small, B is small relative to A+E, and cross-term B·D is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND |B - D| <= 0.18 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND E/S <= 0.30 AND B/S <= 0.30 — i.e., C is the clear primary, B and D are balanced, the A·C·D triple is meaningful, and B and E are not dominant.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.08 — i.e., B and D provide a sustained middle share, A+E do not dominate, C is not large, and the A·B·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially with a strong C·D pairwise interaction while A·B remains small.]

6. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S between 0.12 and 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.028 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D triple is nontrivial and B·E cross-effect is limited.]

7. [Fallback decision rule when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute four composite scores that use all five features: 
   score1 = (A + E)/S + (A*E)/(S^2) - (B*C*D)/(S^3);
   score2 = (B + D)/S + (B*D)/(S^2) - (A*C*E)/(S^3);
   score3 = C/S + (A*C*D)/(S^3) - (B*E)/(S^2);
   score4 = (D + E)/S + (C*D*E)/(S^3) - (A*B)/(S^2);
   Predict the label corresponding to the highest score (1 for score1, 2 for score2, 3 for score3, 4 for score4) — i.e., a multi-term tie-breaker that combines sums, pairwise and triple interactions of all five features.]
