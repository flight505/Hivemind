PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 when (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.24 AND D/S <= 0.34 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.035 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while the combined B·C·D support is limited.]

2. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by B·D while A,C,E triple contribution remains constrained.]

3. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 — i.e., C leads with meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is limited and B/D are balanced.]

4. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with strong D·E while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

5. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 (secondary) when C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A + B)/(S) <= 0.40 — i.e., a three-way C·D·E dominance with low A·B support.]

6. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. When rules 1–5 conflict or multiple class conditions are simultaneously satisfied, compute normalized interaction scores using all five features: P1 = (A*E)*(A + E)/S^3, P2 = (B*D)*B/S^3, P3 = (C*D)*C/S^3, P4 = (D*E)*(D + E)/S^3. Predict the class with the largest Pi (use all five features through S and each product term).]

7. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. To correct borderline cases where a single pair dominates but other features are nonnegligible, predict class X among {1,2,3,4} by computing composite scores that include all five inputs: Score1 = (A*E)/(S^2) + (A/(1+ B + C + D))/S, Score2 = (B*D)/(S^2) + (B/(1+ A + C + E))/S, Score3 = (C*D)/(S^2) + (C/(1+ A + B + E))/S, Score4 = (D*E)/(S^2) + (D/(1+ A + B + C))/S. Predict the class with the highest Score (all five features appear in each score).]

8. [Fallback (strict all-feature threshold): Let S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}. If none of rules 1–7 apply, predict the class corresponding to M only if M/S >= 0.30 AND (product A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06; otherwise predict 4. This final rule uses every feature in S and the full product to enforce an all-feature conditional fallback.]
