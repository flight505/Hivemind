PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 60
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction while B is relatively small, C·D interaction is limited, and the triple A·B·C is not large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.52 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction, C provides additional support, and A and B together are not dominant.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A and E are restrained, B and D are reasonably balanced, and high-order A·B·E interaction is absent.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A and E together remain limited and the triple A·C·E is not large.]

5. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Decision by dominant pair interaction: let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute P_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), P_DE=(D*E)/(S^2), P_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), P_BD=(B*D)/(S^2), P_AB=(A*B)/(S^2). If max{P_AE,P_DE,P_CD,P_BD,P_AB} = P_AE and P_AE >= 0.06 and A/S >= 0.18 and E/S >= 0.15 then predict 1; if the max = P_DE and P_DE >= 0.10 and (D+E)/S >= 0.38 then predict 4; if the max = P_CD and P_CD >= 0.07 and C/S >= 0.30 then predict 3; if the max = P_BD and P_BD >= 0.06 and B/S >= 0.30 then predict 2; otherwise continue — i.e., select the class tied to the strongest normalized pairwise interaction while requiring baseline shares from both members.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.030 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are balanced, and A·C·D triple interaction contributes.]

8. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.36 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.22 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., A and E jointly lead, with measurable A·E interaction and limited disruptive interactions from B·C·D.]

9. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (B*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.03, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (A*C*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.03, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*D*E)/(S^4) <= 0.03, predict 4 if M is D or E and (max(D,E))/S >= 0.28 and (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06, otherwise predict the class corresponding to the largest pairwise normalized product among { (A*E),(D*E),(C*D),(B*D),(A*B) } — i.e., use dominant-feature thresholds while requiring constraints from all five features.]
