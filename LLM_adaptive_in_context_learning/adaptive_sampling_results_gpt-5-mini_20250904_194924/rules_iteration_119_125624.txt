PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 119
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 when A/S >= 0.26 AND ( (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.055 OR (A*B)/(S^2) >= 0.055 ) AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.030 — i.e., A is the clear driver via a strong A·E or A·B interaction while C and D remain limited and the A·C·D triple is not large.]

2. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain constrained.]

3. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is primary, C·D interaction is meaningful, A+B are not excessive, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.050 — i.e., B leads and is supported by B·D while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited.]

5. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. When C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12, choose between 3 and 4 by comparing pairwise strengths: predict 3 if (C*D)/(S^2) >= (D*E)/(S^2) AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., when C, D, E are all substantial, prefer the label whose strongest pairwise normalized interaction (C·D vs D·E) dominates while ensuring A·E is not masking the pattern.]

6. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Predict 1 (override) when A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND (A*B)/(S^2) >= (D*E)/(S^2) AND C/S <= 0.35 — i.e., even if D or E are moderate, favor class 1 when A's interactions (especially with B or E) exceed D·E and C is not large.]

7. [Let S = A + B + C + D + E. Fallback rule using normalized pairwise products: compute P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(A*B)/(S^2), P3=(B*D)/(S^2), P4=(C*D)/(S^2), P5=(D*E)/(S^2). If max{P1..P5} = P1 and A/S >= 0.20 predict 1; if max = P2 and B/S >= 0.20 predict 2; if max = P4 and C/S >= 0.20 predict 3; if max = P5 and (D + E)/S >= 0.38 predict 4. If none of these product-based conditions hold, predict the class of the single largest feature M with M/S >= 0.28 (A->1, B->2, C->3, D/E->4).]
