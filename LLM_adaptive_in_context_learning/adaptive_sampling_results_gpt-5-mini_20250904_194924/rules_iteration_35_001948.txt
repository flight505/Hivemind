PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 35
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.32 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C and D remain limited relative to S.]

2. [Predict 1 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B*(C + D))/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND E/S >= 0.08 — i.e., A is the primary driver but only when its cross-effect with E is meaningful and the B·(C+D) interaction is not large.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND ((C*(A + B))/(S^2)) <= 0.12 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and the A·B and C·(A+B) interactions remain limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with meaningful C·D interaction, A+B collectively restrained, B and D balanced, and A·E not dominant.]

5. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B leads and is supported by B·D while A+E and the triple A·C·E remain limited.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each supply meaningful shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B stays low.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Predict 2 (edge case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.26 AND (B*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (C*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.52 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.18 — i.e., B is leading and its interaction with A and D is substantial while C·E and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

9. [Fallback composite scoring rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E compute class scores using all five features:
   score1 = 1.8*(A + E)/S + 2.5*(A*E)/(S^2) - 1.0*(B*(C + D))/(S^2),
   score2 = 1.6*(B)/S + 1.8*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A*E)/(S^2),
   score3 = 1.7*(C)/S + 1.9*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.8*(A*E)/(S^2),
   score4 = 1.7*(D + E)/S + 2.2*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.9*(A*B)/(S^2);
   predict the class with the largest score, but require the winning score to exceed the second-best by at least 0.10 otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use a global composite that integrates all five features and their pairwise/triple interactions for tie-safe decision-making.]
