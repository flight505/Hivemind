PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 174
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (B*C)/(S^2) <= 0.085 AND D/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.25 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while the B·C pair and C and D remain limited.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a robust D·E interaction while A·B and the A·B·C triple are not large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., C is clearly primary, C·D is meaningful, B and D are balanced, A·E is weak and the A·B·E triple is restrained.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor supported by B·D interaction while A+E and the A·C·E triple remain limited.]

5. [Tie-break dominant-pair rule — when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute pairwise normalized products P_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), P_DE=(D*E)/(S^2), P_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), P_BD=(B*D)/(S^2) and triple-sum T = (A*C*D + B*C*E + A*B*E)/(S^3). If the largest of {P_AE,P_DE,P_CD,P_BD} is at least 1.15× the second largest AND T <= 0.05, then predict according to the dominant pair: AE -> 1, DE -> 4, CD -> 3, BD -> 2 — i.e., pick the class whose pairwise interaction most strongly dominates after accounting for triple interactions across all five features.]

6. [Predict 4 (supporting) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each supply substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B is limited.]
