PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 29
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND P5 <= 0.012 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while C and B remain limited and the full five-way dispersion is low.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND P5 <= 0.015 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by a B·D interaction while A and E together are restrained and overall five-way balance is modest.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND P5 >= 0.004 — i.e., C leads with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is not dominant, and there is a non-negligible 5-way interaction supporting a true C-centered pattern.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND P5 >= 0.006 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C provides additional support and A·B remains limited; the five-way product indicates genuine multi-feature reinforcement.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.24 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND P5 >= 0.005 — i.e., C, D and E together provide substantial shares with a strong triple interaction while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), C/S >= 0.27 AND (A* C * D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND P5 >= 0.003 — i.e., C is central, A and E give supporting mass, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and balance across features indicates a cohesive C-driven pattern.]

7. [Predict 1 when there is a clear A-majority but tempered by others: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), A/S >= 0.34 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.66 AND P5 <= 0.02 — i.e., A is the dominant single contributor with meaningful A·E support and the other features do not collectively overturn an A-centered outcome.]

8. [Fallback multi-feature decision — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P5 = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E} and mprop = max{A, B, C, D, E}/S; predict class corresponding to M if mprop >= 0.30 AND (product of the two smallest features)/(S^2) <= 0.03 AND P5 <= 0.02; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., default to a dominant-feature decision only when dominance is strong and the smallest-feature interactions are weak, otherwise favor the multi-feature-supported class 4.]
