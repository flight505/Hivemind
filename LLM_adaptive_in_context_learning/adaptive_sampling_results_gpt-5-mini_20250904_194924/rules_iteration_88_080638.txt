PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 88
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (B/(1 + A + E)) <= 0.42 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., A and E share bulk of mass, A·C interaction is substantial while C is not dominant alone, B is small relative to A+E, and the B·D support is limited.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND C/S >= 0.24 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (D+E)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.045 — i.e., A and C jointly lead with strong A·C interaction, the sum D+E is moderate (not overwhelming), and the full five-way interaction is not extreme.]

3. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND (C*(D + E))/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.06 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E and supportive C, while A·B are limited and the five-way extreme interaction is absent.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND |A - B|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., three-way C·D·E support dominates and A·B remain low and not highly imbalanced.]

5. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., C leads with meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained and balanced with D, and A·E and full five-way interaction small.]

6. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is primary with B·D support, A+E are limited, C moderate-to-small, and higher-order five-way interaction not dominant.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.033 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support within bounds, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·C·D interaction is meaningful while B·E is limited.]

8. [Ambiguity resolution fallback — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}; predict class according to the dominant-mode interactions: predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.06 and P <= 0.06; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 and P <= 0.06; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.36 or (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 — i.e., use the dominant feature but require supporting pair/triple interactions and limit extreme five-way cases.]
