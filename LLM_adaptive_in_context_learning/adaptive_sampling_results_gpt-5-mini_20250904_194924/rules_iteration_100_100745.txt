PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 100
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a substantial A·E interaction, B and C are limited and B vs D are not extremely imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S <= 0.33 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong pairwise interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the primary contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction while A·E is weak and A+B are restrained.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.44 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B leads with supporting B·D interaction, A+E are not dominant, and the A·C·E triple is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D, E each supply substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.0025 — i.e., A is clearly dominant, A·E supports the dominance, competing B·D interaction is limited, C is not large, and all features jointly contribute a non-negligible baseline.]

8. [Ambiguity-resolution rule — when none of the above strict patterns apply, compute four normalized class scores using all five features: 
   Score1 = 0.45*(A + E)/S + 0.35*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*(B + C + D)/S;
   Score2 = 0.45*B/S + 0.30*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + C + E)/S;
   Score3 = 0.45*C/S + 0.30*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + B + E)/S;
   Score4 = 0.45*(D + E)/S + 0.30*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A + B + C)/S;
   Predict the class with the largest Score (ties broken by largest corresponding pairwise product term among (A*E),(B*D),(C*D),(D*E)).] 

9. [Global safeguard — require every prediction to satisfy at least one combined five-feature consistency check: the chosen class must have at least one supporting pairwise product >= 0.05*(S^2) OR one supporting triple product >= 0.015*(S^3), AND the dominant-sum term for that class (A+E for class1, B for class2, C for class3, D+E for class4) must exceed 0.28*S; otherwise defer to rule 8 for final decision.]
