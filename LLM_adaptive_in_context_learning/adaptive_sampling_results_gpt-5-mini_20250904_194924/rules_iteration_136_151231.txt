PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 136
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, at least three of {A, B, C, D, E} have share >= 0.18 (i.e., count{X: X/S >= 0.18} >= 3) AND (A + E)/S >= 0.24 AND ((A*E) + (B*C) + (C*D))/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (max(A,B,C,D,E) - min(A,B,C,D,E))/S <= 0.45 — i.e., a multi-feature cooperative pattern where three or more features share substantial mass, A and E provide a supporting joint effect, pairwise interactions among different high features are nontrivial, and the overall distribution is relatively balanced.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (E/S >= 0.38) OR (E/S >= 0.28 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND ((A + B + C)/S) <= 0.72 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.04) — i.e., E is a clear dominant contributor (or E+D jointly dominate) with a meaningful D·E interaction while the remaining three features do not collectively overwhelm the E/D dominance.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.35 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (C*(B + D))/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C is the principal driver supported by balanced B and D, the cross-interaction of C with B+D is substantial, and the A·E interaction is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.36 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 AND ((A*B) / (S^2)) <= 0.18 — i.e., B is the leading single contributor with a supporting B·D interaction, A+E stay constrained, C is not dominant, and triple interactions that would pull weight away from a B-led pattern are limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (max(A,B,C,D,E) - median(A,B,C,D,E))/S >= 0.03 — i.e., C, D and E all contribute materially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains small and the top-half spread indicates a C-D-E multi-dominance.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 — i.e., C is important, A+E give measurable support, B and D are reasonably balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is significant while B is not overpowering.]

7. [Predict 1 (tie-breaker) when none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and H = number of features with share >= 0.15, T1 = (A*E)/(S^2), T2 = (B*C)/(S^2), T3 = (C*D)/(S^2): if H >= 2 AND (T1 + T2 + T3) >= 0.14 AND (max(A,B,C,D,E)/S) <= 0.38 then predict 1 — i.e., when multiple moderate features produce strong combined pairwise interactions without a single overwhelming maximum.]

8. [Final fallback — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict: 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.30 AND (B + C + D + E)/S >= 0.70, predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.30 AND (A + C + D + E)/S >= 0.70, predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.30 AND (A + B + D + E)/S >= 0.70, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature logic but require the full five-feature context via S and the complementary mass to avoid misclassifying multi-feature patterns.]
