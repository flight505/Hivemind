PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 49
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND B/S <= 0.28 AND C/S <= 0.28 AND D/S <= 0.30 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B, C, D remain comparatively small.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.13 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A and B are not jointly large.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.085 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D support, A and E are not jointly dominant, B and D are relatively balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.42 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.055 — i.e., B leads with B·D support while A+E remain limited and triple A·C·E is small.]

5. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.34 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND B/S <= 0.22 AND D/S <= 0.28 AND (E/(A + 1)) <= 0.70 — i.e., A is the clear leader with supportive A·C interaction while B and D are low and E is not disproportionately larger than A.]

6. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, E/S >= 0.36 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (D/(B + 1)) >= 0.40 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., E is dominant with a three-way C·D·E reinforcement while A·B remains limited.]

7. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C with supporting D and E (multi-feature support) outweighs A·B influence.]

8. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*D)/(S^2) <= 0.08 — i.e., B leads with cross-support from E but without a strong A·E coupling that would favor class 1.]

9. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A/(B + 1)) >= 1.2 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.58 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) <= 0.018 — i.e., A is substantially larger than B and participates in a meaningful A·E interaction while the triple C·D·E support is weak.]

10. [Fallback scoring rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, compute four class scores that each use all five features: score1 = 2.8*(A*E)/(S^2) + 0.9*(A/S) - 0.6*((B + C + D)/S); score2 = 2.4*(B*D)/(S^2) + 0.8*(B/S) - 0.5*((A + C + E)/S); score3 = 2.6*(C*D)/(S^2) + 0.85*(C/S) - 0.55*((A + B + E)/S); score4 = 2.9*(D*E)/(S^2) + 0.88*((D + E)/S) - 0.52*((A + B + C)/S). Predict the class with the highest score (requires all five features through S and the pair/triple terms).]
