PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.042 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.58 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., D and E together dominate, the triple C·D·E is large, A and B are limited, and the A·B interaction is small.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND |B - D| <= 0.20 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND E/S <= 0.35 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.55 — i.e., C is the principal contributor, B and D are balanced, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, E is not dominant, and A+B are not too large.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.25 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND B/S <= 0.32 — i.e., A and E together strongly dominate, C and D are small-to-moderate, the A·E interaction is strong, and B is relatively small.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.09 — i.e., B and D supply a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C is not dominant, the A·B·E triple is limited, and A·C is not large.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.24 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.56 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially while A and B together are limited and A·B is small.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D| <= 0.28 * S AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide support, B and D are reasonably balanced, A·C·D interaction is nontrivial, and B·E is not large.]

7. [Predict 1 (edge-support) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) >= 0.045 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (B/(S)) <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E are substantial, C is limited, the A·B·E triple is appreciable, D is moderate-to-small, and B is not dominant alone.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and Rmax = max(A, B, C, D, E)/S, predict the class corresponding to argmax{A, B, C, D, E} when Rmax >= 0.35 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.02, otherwise predict 2 — i.e., use the dominant contributor only when one feature clearly dominates relative to the combined interaction, otherwise default to class 2.]
