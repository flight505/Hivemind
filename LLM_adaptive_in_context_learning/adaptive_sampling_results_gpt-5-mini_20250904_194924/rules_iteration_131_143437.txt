PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 131
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate (high share and strong A·E interaction) while B and C remain limited and the competing B·D interaction is weak.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.065 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.045 — i.e., B is the primary contributor supported by a notable B·D interaction while A and E together are not dominant and the A·C·E triple is small.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 — i.e., C is the main share with significant C·D interaction, A·E is not strong, B and D are reasonably balanced and A+B are collectively restrained.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-support case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B is low.]

6. [Predict 3 (supportive-interaction case) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D triple interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Conflict-resolution by dominant interaction: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and define I_AE=(A*E)/(S^2), I_BD=(B*D)/(S^2), I_CD=(C*D)/(S^2), I_DE=(D*E)/(S^2). If max(I_AE,I_BD,I_CD,I_DE) equals I_AE and I_AE >= 0.06 and (A + E)/S >= 0.40 then predict 1; if the max equals I_BD and I_BD >= 0.06 and B/S >= 0.30 then predict 2; if the max equals I_CD and I_CD >= 0.08 and C/S >= 0.30 then predict 3; if the max equals I_DE and I_DE >= 0.12 and (D + E)/S >= 0.42 then predict 4 — i.e., resolve competing signals by selecting the class whose pairwise interaction is both the strongest interaction and supported by sufficient pair share (this condition references all five features through S).]

8. [Fallback dominance-plus-suppression rule: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5), if max(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.30 AND P <= 0.02 then predict the class corresponding to the dominant feature (A->1, B->2, C->3, D or E ->4) — i.e., a single feature strongly dominates while the normalized product of all five is small, using all five features in the decision.]

9. [Tie-breaker using comparative normalized interaction vector: letting S = A + B + C + D + E and compute vector V = [ (A*E)/(S^2), (B*D)/(S^2), (C*D)/(S^2), (D*E)/(S^2), (A*B)/(S^2) ] with accompanying marginal shares U = [A/S,B/S,C/S,D/S,E/S]. If none of rules 1–8 apply, choose the class whose canonical interaction (map: class1->(A*E), class2->(B*D), class3->(C*D), class4->(D*E)) has the highest value in V AND that class's principal marginal share in U >= 0.18, otherwise default to class 4 — this resolves ambiguous multi-feature patterns by comparing normalized pairwise interactions while consulting single-feature shares, and it references all five features via S and the vector computation.]
