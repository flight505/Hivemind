PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 171
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.70 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.36 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.18 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.15 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.03]

5. [Predict 4 (alternate) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12]

6. [Predict 1 when A and E jointly dominate but B, C, D remain limited: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND B/S <= 0.28 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND D/S <= 0.32]

7. [Predict 2 when B leads but C and E together are moderate and cross-interaction is limited: letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*(C+E))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + D)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND |A - D|/S <= 0.35]

8. [Tie-breaker mapping rule â€” if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and let L1,L2 be the two largest single-feature values, predict according to which feature is dominant but only when that dominance interacts with the other features: if L1/S >= 0.30 AND (L1*L2)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (product A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) >= 0.001 then predict 1 if L1 is A, predict 2 if L1 is B, predict 3 if L1 is C, predict 4 if L1 is D or E]
