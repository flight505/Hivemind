PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 83
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.015 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction, A·B are not jointly large, C is limited, and the five-way product is not simultaneously high.]

2. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (B/(A + E + 1)) <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.020 — i.e., A and E together dominate with a meaningful A·E interaction, B is not large relative to A+E, C is limited, and the full five-way product is not simultaneously large.]

3. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., B is the leading contributor supported by a B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is not excessive, and the five-way product remains limited.]

4. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.26 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., C is the primary driver with a meaningful C·D interaction, A and B collectively restrained and balanced with D, A·E not dominant, and the five-way product modest.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.015 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.025 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low and the five-way product is not large.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.032 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.035 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, the A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and the five-way product is controlled.]

7. [Override-to-4 rule: Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.36 AND ((D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 OR (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.012) AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.04 — i.e., if D+E are clearly dominant and either D·E or the C·D·E triple is meaningful, prefer class 4 unless the lower-order product of A,B,C is large.]

8. [Robust-to-1 rule: Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.26 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B*(C + D))/(S^2) <= 0.22 AND (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5) <= 0.030 — i.e., A and E are both substantial, their interaction is meaningful, the combined support from B, C and D is not overwhelming, and the full five-way product is moderate.]

9. [Tiebreak / fallback (uses all five features): If none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and P = (A*E)/(S^2), Q = (B*D)/(S^2), R = (C*D)/(S^2), T = (C*(A + B))/(S^2), U = (A*B*C*D*E)/(S^5): choose the predicted class by the largest relevant interaction score with thresholds: predict 1 if P = max{P,Q,R,T} AND P >= 0.05 AND U <= 0.05; predict 2 if Q = max{P,Q,R,T} AND Q >= 0.05 AND U <= 0.06; predict 3 if R = max{P,Q,R,T} AND R >= 0.06 AND U <= 0.06; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., break ties by the dominant interaction measure while ensuring the five-way product does not indicate an all-features-equal case).]
