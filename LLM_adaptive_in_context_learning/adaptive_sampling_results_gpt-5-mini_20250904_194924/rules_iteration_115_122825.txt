PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 115
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND B/(A + E + 1) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E together dominate, their multiplicative interaction is substantial, C and D are limited, and B is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.11 AND C/S <= 0.34 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) <= 0.11 — i.e., D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B and C·(A+B) remain constrained.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.32 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.47 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.075 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.065 — i.e., C is the primary contributor, C·D interaction is meaningful, A·E is not dominant, and B and D are balanced.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.31 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.46 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.055 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.052 — i.e., B leads with supportive B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (multi-feature cluster) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.017 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.145 — i.e., C, D and E each provide substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

6. [Predict 3 (supporting A/E) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.032 — i.e., C is important, A+E give supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

7. [Predict 1 (A-dominant tie-break) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND D/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A is clearly dominant, A·E provides additional support, and the other features are restrained.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.02, predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.02, predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.02, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use dominant-feature proportion together with minimal supporting interactions across all five features.]
