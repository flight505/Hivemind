PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 134
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.48 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.35 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B and C are not large and B vs D are not highly imbalanced.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.38 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by B·D interaction while A and E together are restrained and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.24 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., C leads with substantial C·D interaction, A and B collectively are limited, B and D are balanced, and A·E is not dominant.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, ((D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16) OR (C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018) AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16 — i.e., either D and E jointly dominate with a strong D·E interaction or C, D and E jointly provide substantial balanced shares (with A·B remaining limited).]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.28 AND ((A*C + A*E)/(S^2)) >= 0.09 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.50 AND (C*E)/(S^2) >= 0.02 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A is the dominant single feature but only when its cross-interactions with C and E are substantial while B and D together are not overpowering.]

6. [Predict 4 (balanced-high rule) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, min(A,B,C,D,E)/S >= 0.12 AND max(A,B,C,D,E)/S <= 0.36 AND ((A*B + A*C + A*D + A*E + B*C + B*D + B*E + C*D + C*E + D*E)/(S^2)) >= 0.50 AND |max(A,B,C,D,E) - min(A,B,C,D,E)|/S <= 0.25 — i.e., all five features contribute substantially and evenly and the sum of pairwise interactions is high, favoring class 4.]

7. [Fallback complex tiebreaker — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and letting P1=(A*E)/(S^2), P2=(B*D)/(S^2), P3=(C*D)/(S^2), P4=(D*E)/(S^2), P5=(C*E)/(S^2): predict 1 if P1 = max{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5} AND (A + E)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + C)/S <= 0.50; predict 2 if P2 = max{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5} AND B/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45; predict 3 if P3 = max{P1,P2,P3,P4,P5} AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.16; otherwise predict 4 — i.e., use the strongest normalized pairwise interaction together with global proportion constraints across all five features as a final decision.]
