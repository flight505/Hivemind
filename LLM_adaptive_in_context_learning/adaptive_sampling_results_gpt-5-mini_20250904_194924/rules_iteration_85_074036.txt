PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 85
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A/S >= 0.20 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*E) >= 1.1*max(A*B, A*C, B*C, B*D, C*D, B*E, C*E, D*E) AND (C/S) <= 0.38 — i.e., A and E form the dominant cross-feature interaction that exceeds other pairwise interactions while C is not overwhelmingly large.]

2. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.40 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.10 AND (D*E) >= 1.0*max(A*B, A*C, B*C, A*E, B*E, C*E) AND (A/S) <= 0.36 — i.e., D and E together dominate with the largest pairwise product among all pairs, and A is not the leading single contributor.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.05 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (C*(A + B))/(S^2) >= 0.06 — i.e., C is the principal share with a meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is subdued, B and D are reasonably balanced, and C has supporting interactions with A or B.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (B*E)/(S^2) >= 0.03 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the leading contributor reinforced by a B·D interaction while A and E together do not dominate and A·C is limited.]

5. [Pairwise dominance tie-breaker: let Pmax = argmax{A*E, D*E, C*D, B*D, A*B} and S = A + B + C + D + E; then if Pmax = A*E and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.045 AND A/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.12 predict 1; if Pmax = D*E and (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND (D + E)/S >= 0.38 predict 4; if Pmax = C*D and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND C/S >= 0.25 predict 3; if Pmax = B*D and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND B/S >= 0.27 predict 2 — i.e., use the largest cross-feature product plus feature proportions to decide when one pair clearly dominates.]

6. [Triple-contributor consensus for 4: let S = A + B + C + D + E; if C/S >= 0.18 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.020 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 predict 4 — i.e., when C, D and E each contribute substantial shares and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B remains low.]

7. [Conflict-resolution weighted score fallback: let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute class scores using all five features: score1 = 0.50*(A/S) + 0.40*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*((B + C)/S); score2 = 0.50*(B/S) + 0.35*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.15*((A + E)/S); score3 = 0.50*(C/S) + 0.35*(C*D)/(S^2) - 0.15*(A*E)/(S^2); score4 = 0.50*((D + E)/S) + 0.35*(D*E)/(S^2) - 0.15*(A*B)/(S^2). If none of the above rules fire, predict the class with the largest score (ties broken by the class with the larger dominant single-feature proportion).]
