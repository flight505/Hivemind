PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.30 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.18 AND |B - C|/S <= 0.35 — i.e., A and E jointly provide a strong base, their pairwise interaction is appreciable, the B·D interaction is limited, and B and C are not extremely disparate.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.40 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*D)/(S^3) <= 0.05 AND |A - E|/S <= 0.30 — i.e., B and D together dominate a large share, C is small, extreme A/E imbalance is absent, and the high-order A·B·D interaction is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (A + C + D)/S >= 0.55 AND (A*C)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.20 AND E/S <= 0.35 — i.e., C is the primary contributor supported by A and D, A·C is meaningful, B·D is not dominant, and E is not large.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND B/S <= 0.30 AND C/S >= 0.08 — i.e., D and E together dominate, the triple C·D·E interaction is significant, A·B is limited, B is not large, and C provides a supporting share.]

5. [Predict 1 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, A >= max(B, C, D, E) AND (A*E*C)/(S^3) >= 0.06 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.35 — i.e., A is the single-leading contributor but only yields class-1 when its high-order interaction with E and C is substantial while B+D remain moderate.]

6. [Predict 4 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, D/S >= 0.20 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.60 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.025 — i.e., both D and E are individually substantial, their pairwise and triple interactions with C are nontrivial, and A+B do not overwhelm the total.]

7. [Predict 3 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.03 AND (B + E)/S <= 0.55 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.30 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.20 — i.e., C is important, the A·C·D interaction contributes materially, B and D are reasonably balanced, and B+E are not dominant.]

8. [Predict 2 (secondary condition) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.28 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.40 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.07 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.03 — i.e., B and D supply a moderate-to-large share, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, the A·B·E triple is limited, and the B·D interaction contributes.]

9. [Fallback composite scoring rule — if none of the above apply, let S = A + B + C + D + E and compute four normalized scores using all five features: score1 = 0.45*(A+E)/S + 0.35*(A*E)/(S^2) - 0.20*(B*D)/(S^2) + 0.10*C/S; score2 = 0.50*(B+D)/S + 0.30*(B*D)/(S^2) - 0.20*(A*E)/(S^2) + 0.10*C/S; score3 = 0.60*C/S + 0.20*(A*C + C*D)/(S^2) - 0.25*(B+E)/S; score4 = 0.50*(D+E)/S + 0.30*(D*E)/(S^2) + 0.20*(C*D*E)/(S^3) - 0.15*(A+B)/S. Predict the class with the largest score (scores use all five features to decide).]
