PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 24
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.42 AND C/S >= 0.12 AND (C * D * E) / (S^3) >= 0.035 AND (A * B) / (S^2) <= 0.18 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) >= 0.0015 — i.e., D and E together dominate while C is a meaningful co-contributor, A·B interaction is limited, and the full five-way interaction is non-negligible.]

2. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND |B - D| <= 0.20 * S AND (A * C) / (S^2) >= 0.05 AND E/S <= 0.35 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) >= 0.001 — i.e., C is the primary driver, B and D are balanced, A·C is appreciable, E is not dominant, and all five features jointly support the pattern.]

3. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.18 AND D/S <= 0.28 AND (B / (A + E + 1)) <= 0.45 AND (A * E) / (S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., A and E together dominate, C and D are modest, B is small relative to A+E, and the global interaction is limited.]

4. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (B + D)/S >= 0.30 AND (B + D)/S <= 0.60 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.50 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A * B * E) / (S^3) <= 0.07 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) <= 0.02 — i.e., B and D provide a moderate share, A and E do not dominate, C is not large, and triple/five-way interactions do not drive the case toward other classes.]

5. [Predict 4 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND D/S >= 0.18 AND E/S >= 0.18 AND (A * B) / (S^2) <= 0.16 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) >= 0.0009 — i.e., C, D and E each contribute substantially while A·B remains low and the five-way product supports a grouped high-state.]

6. [Predict 3 (secondary) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.15 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND |B - D| <= 0.25 * S AND (A * C * D) / (S^3) >= 0.03 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (S^5) >= 0.0008 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are reasonably balanced, and multi-way interactions favor class 3.]

7. [Fallback decision (use when none of the above rules apply): let S = A + B + C + D + E and pA = A/S, pB = B/S, pC = C/S, pD = D/S, pE = E/S; compute scores using all five normalized features: score1 = 1.0*pA + 0.6*pE - 0.4*pB - 0.3*pC - 0.2*pD; score2 = 1.0*pB + 0.6*pD - 0.4*pA - 0.2*pE - 0.1*pC; score3 = 1.0*pC + 0.4*pA + 0.3*pB - 0.5*pD - 0.2*pE; score4 = 0.9*pD + 0.9*pE + 0.3*pC - 0.4*pA - 0.3*pB; predict the class with the highest score — i.e., a weighted multi-feature contest that uses all five inputs together.]
