PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 112
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND B/S <= 0.22 AND C/S <= 0.22 AND D/(A + E + 1) <= 0.40 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a strong A·E interaction while B and C remain limited and D is not large relative to A+E.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.32 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.40 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., B is the primary driver supported by B·D interaction, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and the triple A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.18 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.45 — i.e., C is the main contributor with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, A·E is not dominant, and A+B collectively restrained.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND C/S >= 0.18 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while A·B is small and C contributes to a nontrivial C·D·E interaction.]

5. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/(B + D + C + 1) >= 1.2 AND (A*E)/(B*D + C + 1) >= 1.5 AND C/S <= 0.25 AND A/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.18 — i.e., A+E outweigh the combined influence of B,D,C and their normalized A·E advantage is large, with C relatively small.]

6. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (C*(A + D))/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.22 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.10 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., C is central and interacts with A/D, B and D are balanced, A+E provide modest support, while B·E is limited.]

7. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*(A + C))/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (D + E)/S <= 0.55 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.08 AND (C*D)/(S^2) <= 0.10 — i.e., B leads and is reinforced by interactions with A/C while D+E do not overwhelm the profile and cross-products that favor other classes remain limited.]

8. [Fallback rule — if none of the above rules apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}, predict the class corresponding to M only if M/S >= 0.33 AND (M * median_of_other_features)/ (S^2) >= 0.03, otherwise predict 4 — i.e., require a clear dominant feature by proportion and a minimal interaction advantage across all five features before selecting its class; otherwise default to 4.]
