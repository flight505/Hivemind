PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 113
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 1 when (A + B + C)/S >= 0.60 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND D/S <= 0.25 AND E/S <= 0.35 — i.e., the triple A·B·C collectively dominates while D and E remain relatively small.]

2. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 1 when A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.07 AND (B + C + D)/S <= 0.72 AND (B*D)/(S^2) <= 0.12 — i.e., A leads, A·E interaction is substantial, and competing B/D interactions are limited.]

3. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 — i.e., B is the primary driver with supporting B·D interaction while A+E and triple A·C·E remain constrained.]

4. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.30 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.09 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 — i.e., C dominates with a meaningful C·D interaction, B and D are balanced, and A+E are not dominant.]

5. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 4 when (D + E)/S >= 0.45 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.35 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.15 — i.e., D and E together dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C and A·B remain limited.]

6. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 4 when C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.02 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 — i.e., the triple C·D·E is collectively important and A·B is weak.]

7. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 3 when C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 — i.e., C is primary, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, and the A·C·D interaction is meaningful.]

8. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Predict 2 when B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (D + E)/S <= 0.60 — i.e., B leads with a supporting B·D interaction while the full triple A·B·C and D+E are constrained.]

9. [Letting S = A + B + C + D + E: Fallback rule — if none of the above match, let M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}. Predict 1 if M is A and A/S >= 0.28 and (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04; predict 2 if M is B and B/S >= 0.28 and (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04; predict 3 if M is C and C/S >= 0.28 and (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.05; otherwise predict 4 if (D + E)/S >= 0.40 and (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.04; if still tied, predict the class whose leading feature has the largest product with its strongest partner (choose argmax among A*E, B*D, C*D, D*E) normalized by S^2.]
