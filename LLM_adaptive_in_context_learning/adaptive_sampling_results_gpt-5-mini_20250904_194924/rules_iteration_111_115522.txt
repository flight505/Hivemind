PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 111
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [Predict 1 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (A + E)/S >= 0.46 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND B/S <= 0.36 AND C/S <= 0.20 AND D/S <= 0.30 AND (A*B*C)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., A and E jointly dominate with a substantial A·E interaction while B, C, D remain limited and the triple A·B·C is small.]

2. [Predict 2 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, B/S >= 0.30 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.45 AND C/S <= 0.42 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.20 — i.e., B leads and is supported by B·D, A+E do not dominate, C is moderate-to-small, and triple A·C·E is limited.]

3. [Predict 3 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.08 AND (A*E)/(S^2) <= 0.06 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.50 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.25 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.04 — i.e., C is primary with meaningful C·D interaction, A·E is weak, A and B are collectively restrained, B and D are balanced, and cross triple A·B·E is limited.]

4. [Predict 4 when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, (D + E)/S >= 0.44 AND (D*E)/(S^2) >= 0.12 AND C/S <= 0.32 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.13 AND (A*C)/(S^2) <= 0.12 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.03 — i.e., D and E dominate with a strong D·E interaction while C is not dominant and A·B and cross triples remain limited.]

5. [Predict 4 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.20 AND D/S >= 0.22 AND E/S >= 0.20 AND (C*D*E)/(S^3) >= 0.018 AND (A*B)/(S^2) <= 0.14 AND (A + B)/S <= 0.40 — i.e., C, D, E each contribute materially and their triple interaction is nontrivial while A·B and A+B remain low.]

6. [Predict 3 (alternative) when, letting S = A + B + C + D + E, C/S >= 0.25 AND (A + E)/S >= 0.12 AND (A + E)/S <= 0.48 AND |B - D|/S <= 0.28 AND (A*C*D)/(S^3) >= 0.035 AND (B*E)/(S^2) <= 0.07 — i.e., C is important, A+E provide supporting share, B and D are balanced, A·C·D interaction is meaningful, and B·E is limited.]

7. [Fallback consolidated rule — if none of the above apply, letting S = A + B + C + D + E and M = argmax{A, B, C, D, E}: predict 1 if M is A AND A/S >= 0.28 AND (A*E)/(S^2) >= 0.05 AND (B*C*D)/(S^3) <= 0.06; predict 2 if M is B AND B/S >= 0.28 AND (B*D)/(S^2) >= 0.04 AND (A*C*E)/(S^3) <= 0.06; predict 3 if M is C AND C/S >= 0.28 AND (C*D)/(S^2) >= 0.06 AND (A*B*E)/(S^3) <= 0.05; otherwise predict 4 (i.e., use dominant feature proportion adjusted by 2-way and 3-way interactions among all five features).]
