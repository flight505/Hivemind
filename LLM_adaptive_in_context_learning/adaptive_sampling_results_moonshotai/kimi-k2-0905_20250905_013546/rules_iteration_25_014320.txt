3. If (A ≤ 50 OR B ≤ 50) AND C ≤ 40 AND (E ≥ 60 OR D ≥ 40) AND (A + B + C) ≤ 120 AND (D + E) ≥ 80, predict 3
4. If (A ≥ 85 AND B ≤ 50) AND C ≤ 30 AND D ≤ 30 AND E ≤ 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) ≤ 250, predict 4
5. If (A ≥ 65 OR B ≥ 65) AND C ≤ 25 AND D ≤ 20 AND E ≤ 25 AND (A + B + C) ≥ 150 AND (A + B + E) ≤ 200, predict 1
6. If (A + B) ≤ 100 AND C ≤ 10 AND (D ≤ 50 OR E ≤ 60) AND (A + D + E) ≥ 100 AND (B + C + D) ≤ 140, predict 2
7. If (A ≥ 60 AND B ≥ 60) AND (C ≤ 60 OR D ≤ 60) AND (B + C + D) ≥ 140 AND (A + D + E) ≤ 180, predict 1
8. If A ≤ 30 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≤ 30 AND (D ≥ 50 OR E ≥ 50) AND (A + B + C) ≤ 100 AND (D + E) ≥ 90, predict 4
