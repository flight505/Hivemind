PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A ≤ 50 AND C ≤ 40 AND E ≤ 30) AND (30 ≤ A + D ≤ 60) AND (25 ≤ B ≤ 80) AND C ≤ 20, predict 2

2. If (A ≥ 90 OR E ≥ 90) AND (C ≤ 30 AND D ≥ 20) AND (A + C ≤ 110 OR E ≥ 85) AND (B ≤ 60 OR A ≥ 95), predict 1

3. If (80 ≤ C ≤ 95) AND (25 ≤ A ≤ 60 OR 30 ≤ B ≤ 70) AND (D ≤ 40 OR E ≤ 55) AND (A + D ≤ 190 OR C + D ≥ 115), predict 3

4. If (A ≤ 50 AND C ≤ 60 AND E ≤ 30) AND (50 ≤ A + C + D ≤ 110) AND (B ≤ 60 OR C ≤ 35) AND D ≥ 20, predict 3

5. If (50 ≤ B ≤ 90 AND 50 ≤ C ≤ 95) AND (A ≤ 35 OR D ≤ 35) AND (A + D ≤ 90 OR B + C ≥ 130) AND E ≤ 65, predict 3

6. If (A ≥ 90 OR B ≥ 80) AND C ≤ 40 AND (60 ≤ D ≤ 90 OR 80 ≤ E ≤ 100) AND (A + C ≥ 105 OR B + D ≥ 140), predict 1

7. If (60 ≤ A ≤ 100 AND 70 ≤ B ≤ 100 AND 50 ≤ C ≤ 90) AND (40 ≤ D ≤ 85 OR 55 ≤ E ≤ 100) AND A + B + C ≥ 200, predict 4

8. If (A ≤ 60 OR B ≤ 40) AND 70 ≤ C ≤ 100 AND 0 ≤ D ≤ 40 AND 50 ≤ E ≤ 90 AND A + C + E ≤ 200, predict 3
