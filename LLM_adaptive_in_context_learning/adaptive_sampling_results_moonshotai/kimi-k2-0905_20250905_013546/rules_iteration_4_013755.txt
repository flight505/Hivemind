============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A + E) ≥ 140 AND (B + C + D) ≤ 180 AND C ≤ 70 AND A ≥ 60 AND E ≥ 70, predict 1
2. If (A + B + C + D) ≤ 200 AND E ≥ 60 AND C ≤ 50 AND (A ≤ 40 OR B ≤ 30) AND D ≤ 50, predict 3
3. If (B + D) ≥ 120 AND A ≤ 60 AND C ≤ 70 AND E ≥ 60 AND (A + C) ≤ 120, predict 3
4. If (A * C)/(B + D + E) ≤ 8 AND A ≥ 50 AND B ≥ 60 AND C ≤ 80 AND E ≥ 70 AND D ≥ 70, predict 4
5. If (C + E) ≤ 80 AND (A + B) ≥ 90 AND B ≥ 60 AND D ≤ 50 AND A ≥ 50, predict 4
6. If (A + B + C) ≤ 150 AND E ≤ 50 AND D ≤ 50 AND C ≤ 60 AND B ≥ 40, predict 3
7. If (A + D) ≥ 140 AND B ≥ 80 AND C ≤ 80 AND E ≥ 70 AND (B + C) ≥ 120, predict 4
8. If (B * C)/(A + D + E) ≥ 25 AND B ≥ 60 AND C ≥ 80 AND A ≤ 70 AND D ≤ 50, predict 4
9. If (A + E) ≤ 100 AND (B + C + D) ≥ 160 AND B ≥ 50 AND C ≥ 50 AND D ≥ 40, predict 2
10. If (A + B + C + D + E) ≥ 350 AND A ≥ 90 AND C ≥ 80 AND D ≥ 80 AND E ≥ 80, predict 4
