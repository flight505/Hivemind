IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (E ≤ 30 OR A ≤ 25) AND (B ≥ 60 OR C ≥ 70) AND D ≥ 50 AND (A + E) ≤ 80 AND (B + C + D) ≥ 200, predict 3
2. If (A + B) ≤ 100 AND C ≥ 70 AND (D ≤ 30 OR E ≤ 40) AND (A ≤ 40 OR B ≤ 60) AND A + C ≥ 100, predict 2
3. If A ≥ 70 AND B ≥ 60 AND C ≥ 50 AND D ≤ 30 AND E ≤ 40 AND (A + B + C) ≥ 200, predict 1
4. If (A ≥ 80 OR B ≥ 90) AND E ≤ 30 AND C ≥ 80 AND (D ≥ 80 OR A ≥ 90) AND (A + C + D) ≥ 250, predict 1
5. If (B + C + E) ≥ 220 AND A ≤ 40 AND D ≥ 60 AND (C ≥ 60 OR E ≥ 80) AND A + D ≤ 100, predict 4
6. If A ≥ 80 AND B ≥ 30 AND C ≥ 50 AND D ≤ 20 AND E ≤ 30 AND (A + C) ≥ 130, predict 1
7. If (A + E) ≥ 120 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≥ 50 AND (B + C + D) ≥ 150 AND E ≥ 80, predict 4
8. If (A + B + C) ≤ 110 AND D ≥ 70 AND E ≥ 80 AND A ≤ 40 AND B ≤ 50 AND (C + D + E) ≥ 190, predict 4
9. If A ≤ 20 AND B ≥ 55 AND (C ≥ 35 OR D ≥ 25) AND E ≥ 85 AND (B + E) ≥ 140, predict 2
10. If (A ≥ 85 OR B ≥ 90) AND C ≥ 85 AND D ≥ 80 AND E ≤ 25 AND (A + B + C + D) ≥ 340, predict 1
11. If A ≥ 50 AND B ≥ 80 AND C ≤ 35 AND D ≥ 50 AND E ≥ 60 AND (B + E) ≥ 150, predict 1
12. If A ≤ 35 AND B ≤ 35 AND C ≥ 70 AND D ≥ 65 AND E ≥ 75 AND (C + D + E) ≥ 220, predict 4
13. If B ≥ 80 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≤ 15 AND E ≥ 75 AND A ≤ 35 AND (B + E) ≥ 160, predict 2
14. If A ≥ 70 AND B ≤ 30 AND C ≥ 65 AND D ≥ 55 AND E ≥ 95 AND (D + E) ≥ 150, predict 4
15. If A ≥ 95 AND B ≥ 30 AND C ≥ 55 AND D ≤ 15 AND E ≤ 25 AND (A + C) ≥ 150, predict 1
