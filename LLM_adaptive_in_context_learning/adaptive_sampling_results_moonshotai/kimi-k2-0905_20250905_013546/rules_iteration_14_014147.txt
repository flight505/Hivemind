IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If A ≤ 55 AND B ≤ 50 AND (C ≥ 50 OR E ≥ 75) AND (D + E) ≥ 90 AND (A + B) ≤ 100 AND (C + D + E) ≥ 180, predict 4
2. If B ≤ 45 AND C ≥ 75 AND (D ≥ 35 OR E ≥ 55) AND (C + D) ≥ 115 AND (A + C + D) ≥ 150 AND (B + E) ≤ 110, predict 3
3. If A ≤ 25 AND B ≤ 50 AND C ∈ [45, 90] AND (D + E) ≥ 70 AND (C + D) ≥ 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) ≤ 300, predict 4
4. If (A + B) ∈ [90, 130] AND C ∈ [25, 55] AND D ∈ [10, 45] AND E ∈ [90, 100] AND (D + E) ≥ 105 AND (A - C) ≥ 20, predict 1
