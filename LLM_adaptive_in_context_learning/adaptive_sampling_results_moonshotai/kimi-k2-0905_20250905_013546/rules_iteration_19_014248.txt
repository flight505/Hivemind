IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A ≤ 40 OR B ≤ 40) AND D ≥ 80 AND E ≥ 70 AND (C ≤ 60 OR A + C ≤ 100), predict 3
2. If (A + E) ≤ 100 AND B ≥ 65 AND C ≥ 40 AND D ≥ 25 AND (B + C) ≥ 120, predict 2
3. If C ≥ 75 AND D ≤ 25 AND E ≥ 70 AND A ≤ 60 AND (A + B) ≤ 100, predict 4
4. If A ≥ 85 AND C ≥ 70 AND E ≤ 50 AND (B ≤ 60 OR D ≤ 70) AND (A + C) ≥ 160, predict 1
5. If (B + C) ≥ 140 AND D ≤ 80 AND E ≥ 80 AND A ≤ 50 AND (A + D) ≤ 100, predict 4
6. If (A + B + C) ≤ 140 AND D ≥ 85 AND (A ≤ 20 OR B ≤ 30) AND E ≥ 70 AND (C + E) ≥ 110, predict 3
7. If (A ≥ 80 AND E ≤ 30) OR (C ≥ 80 AND D ≤ 40) AND (A + B + C) ≥ 180 AND (B + D) ≤ 140, predict 1
8. If (B ≥ 75 OR C ≥ 75) AND D ≤ 40 AND E ≥ 90 AND A ≤ 30 AND (A + D) ≤ 70, predict 2
9. If (A + E) ≥ 150 AND B ≤ 30 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≥ 50 AND (A + C) ≥ 140, predict 4
10. If (A ≤ 10 OR B ≤ 15) AND C ≤ 20 AND D ≤ 30 AND E ≥ 80 AND (B + C + D) ≤ 80, predict 3
11. If A ≥ 90 AND B ≥ 50 AND C ≥ 70 AND D ≤ 70 AND E ≤ 60 AND (A + C) ≥ 170, predict 1
12. If (C + D) ≥ 150 AND A ≤ 35 AND B ≤ 60 AND E ≤ 40 AND (A + B) ≤ 90, predict 3
13. If E ≥ 80 AND A ≤ 40 AND B ≥ 50 AND C ≤ 90 AND (A + C) ≤ 120 AND (B + D) ≥ 100, predict 2
