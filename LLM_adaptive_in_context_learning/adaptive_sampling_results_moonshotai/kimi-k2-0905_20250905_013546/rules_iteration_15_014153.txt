IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A ≤ 15 OR B ≤ 25) AND (C ≤ 55 OR D ≥ 70) AND (E ≥ 40 AND E ≤ 50) AND (A + C) ≤ 70 AND (B + D) ≥ 100, predict 3
2. If A ≤ 10 AND B ≤ 30 AND (45 ≤ C ≤ 65) AND (35 ≤ D ≤ 55) AND E ≥ 90 AND (C + D + E) ≥ 180, predict 4
3. If (A ≥ 75 OR B ≥ 60) AND C ≤ 40 AND (20 ≤ D ≤ 50) AND (80 ≤ E ≤ 100) AND (A + C) ≥ 100 AND (A + D + E) ≤ 220, predict 1
4. If (25 ≤ A ≤ 60) AND (15 ≤ B ≤ 55) AND C ≥ 60 AND (30 ≤ D ≤ 60) AND (50 ≤ E ≤ 70) AND (A + C) ≤ 120, predict 4
5. If (B ≤ 30 OR C ≤ 20) AND (A ≥ 70 OR E ≥ 55) AND (D ≤ 10 OR A ≥ 80) AND (A + E) ≥ 140 AND (B + C) ≤ 60, predict 2
6. If A ≥ 85 AND B ≤ 60 AND C ≤ 40 AND D ≤ 40 AND (E ≥ 85 OR E ≤ 50) AND (A + B) ≥ 130, predict 1
7. If (A ≤ 25 AND D ≤ 30) OR (B ≤ 35 AND C ≥ 70 AND E ≥ 80) AND (A + B + D) ≤ 100 AND (C + E) ≥ 150, predict 4
8. If (A ≥ 50 OR B ≥ 45) AND (C ≤ 55 AND D ≤ 50) AND (40 ≤ E ≤ 60) AND (A + D) ≤ 110 AND (B + C) ≤ 110, predict 2
9. If A ≥ 85 AND (B ≥ 30 OR C ≥ 25) AND D ≤ 25 AND (E ≤ 50 OR E ≥ 90) AND (A + B + C) ≥ 140 AND E ≥ 40, predict 1
