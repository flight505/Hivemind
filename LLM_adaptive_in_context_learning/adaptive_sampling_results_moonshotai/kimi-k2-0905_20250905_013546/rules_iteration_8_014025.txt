1. If (A ≥ 85 AND C ≤ 50 AND D ≤ 30 AND E ≤ 30) OR (A ≥ 90 AND B ≤ 20 AND C ≤ 50 AND D ≤ 20 AND E ≤ 20), predict 2
2. If (A ≥ 80 AND B ≥ 70 AND C ≤ 30 AND D ≥ 60 AND E ≥ 60 AND A + B ≥ 150), predict 1
3. If (A ≤ 40 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≤ 40 AND D ≤ 30 AND E ≤ 30 AND A + B + C + D + E ≤ 150), predict 3
4. If (A ≤ 60 AND B ≥ 60 AND C ≤ 50 AND D ≥ 60 AND E ≥ 70 AND B + D + E ≥ 200 AND A + C ≤ 110), predict 3
5. If (A ≥ 80 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≥ 60 AND E ≥ 60 AND C + D + E ≥ 200), predict 2
6. If (A ≤ 50 AND B ≤ 20 AND C ≤ 50 AND D ≤ 50 AND E ≥ 70 AND E ≥ A + B + C + D), predict 2
