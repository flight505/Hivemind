2. If A ≥ 95 AND B ≥ 75 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≥ 90 AND E ≥ 90 AND (A + B + C + D + E) ≥ 480 AND (C + D) ≥ 150, predict 4
3. If A ≤ 60 AND B ≤ 50 AND C ≥ 95 AND D ≤ 40 AND E ≥ 65 AND (A + B + D) ≤ 150 AND (C + E) ≥ 165, predict 2
4. If A ≤ 70 AND B ≤ 55 AND C ≤ 20 AND D ≤ 55 AND E ≥ 95 AND (A + B + C + D) ≤ 200 AND (D + E) ≥ 140, predict 2
