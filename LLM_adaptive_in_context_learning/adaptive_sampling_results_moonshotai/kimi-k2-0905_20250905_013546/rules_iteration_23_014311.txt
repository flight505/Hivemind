============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If C ≤ 50 AND D ≤ 60 AND (A + B + C) ≤ 200 AND E ≤ 50 AND (A ≤ 30 OR B ≤ 30), predict 3
2. If (A ≥ 80 OR B ≥ 80) AND C ≤ 30 AND D ≤ 60 AND E ≤ 30 AND (A + B) ≥ 150, predict 1
3. If (50 ≤ A ≤ 70 OR 50 ≤ B ≤ 70) AND 30 ≤ C ≤ 70 AND 40 ≤ D ≤ 70 AND E ≤ 50 AND (A + C + D) ≤ 200, predict 2
4. If A ≤ 20 AND B ≤ 50 AND C ≤ 30 AND D ≤ 50 AND E ≥ 70 AND (B + C + D) ≤ 150, predict 2
5. If (A ≥ 70 OR B ≥ 70) AND C ≤ 40 AND D ≥ 70 AND E ≤ 40 AND (A + D) ≥ 140, predict 1
6. If (A ≤ 40 AND B ≤ 60) AND C ≥ 70 AND D ≥ 70 AND E ≥ 70 AND (C + D + E) ≥ 250, predict 4
7. If A ≥ 85 AND B ≥ 75 AND C ≥ 75 AND D ≥ 50 AND E ≥ 50 AND (A + B + C) ≥ 250, predict 3
8. If A ≤ 30 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≤ 40 AND D ≤ 60 AND E ≥ 80 AND (A + B + C + D) ≤ 170, predict 2
9. If (65 ≤ A ≤ 85 OR 65 ≤ B ≤ 85) AND 40 ≤ C ≤ 80 AND 50 ≤ D ≤ 80 AND 50 ≤ E ≤ 80 AND (A + B + C + D) ≤ 300, predict 2
10. If A ≥ 90 AND B ≤ 30 AND C ≤ 30 AND D ≥ 65 AND E ≤ 30 AND (A + D) ≥ 160, predict 1
