============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A + B) ≤ 100 AND (C + D) ≥ 120 AND E ≤ 50 AND A ≤ 50 AND C ≥ 70, predict 3
2. If (A + C) ≥ 130 AND (B + D) ≤ 80 AND E ≥ 85 AND A ≥ 70 AND B ≤ 30, predict 1
3. If (B + C) ≥ 100 AND (A + D) ≤ 110 AND E ≥ 60 AND B ≥ 40 AND C ≥ 60, predict 4
4. If (A * C)/(B + D + E) ≥ 15 AND A ≥ 70 AND B ≤ 40 AND C ≥ 30 AND E ≥ 65, predict 1
5. If (C + E) ≥ 140 AND (A + B) ≤ 80 AND D ≥ 70 AND C ≥ 60 AND E ≥ 60, predict 4
6. If (A + B + C) ≤ 150 AND (D + E) ≥ 120 AND C ≥ 60 AND D ≥ 70 AND E ≥ 60, predict 3
7. If (B * D)/(A + C + E) ≥ 5 AND B ≥ 70 AND D ≥ 60 AND A ≤ 50 AND E ≥ 70, predict 4
8. If (A + E) ≥ 140 AND (B + C + D) ≤ 150 AND A ≥ 70 AND E ≥ 80 AND B ≤ 50, predict 1
9. If (C + D) ≥ 130 AND (A + B + E) ≤ 140 AND C ≥ 80 AND D ≥ 50 AND B ≤ 40, predict 3
10. If (A + B + C + D + E) ≥ 300 AND B ≥ 50 AND C ≥ 80 AND D ≥ 50 AND E ≤ 50, predict 2
