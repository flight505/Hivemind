First, the user instructed to create GENERAL rules for complex interdependent datasets, focusing on COMPLEX PATTERNS requiring ALL 5 features (A, B, C, D, E). I must not memorize specific cases or create index-specific rules. Every rule I generate must involve mathematical combinations of all five features, like products, ratios, sums, and conditions that interdepend on them all.

Key requirements from the system prompt:
- Rules should address error patterns in the data (many predictions are wrong to 2, but actuals are 1, 3, or 4).
- Patterns need to be generalized to fix ALL similar cases, not just the listed errors.
- Focus on interdependent relationships: e.g., ratios, thresholds across multiple features.
- Forebidden: No memorizing row indices, exact matches, or simple single-feature rules.

To create these rules, I analyzed the error data for overarching patterns without fixing specific indices:
- For errors where predicted 2 but actual 4: Often B is relatively small, C and D are large, A and E are moderate. General rule: Use expressions amplifying C*D and comparing to A+B+E, with thresholds.
- For errors where predicted 2 but actual 1: Often B is large, D is small, A and C are decent. Rule: Favor high B/D ratios with all features balanced.
- For errors where predicted 2 but actual 3: Middle-ground patterns, perhaps balanced sums/products. Rules to differentiate based on complex interactions.

I formulated 25 rules (expanding from the original 36) that override or add to the current set, ensuring each uses ALL 5 features in interdependent ways (e.g., (A * D + B * E) / (C + 1) requires A,B,C,D,E; (A + B + C + D + E) / 5 < B + C - D ties them all).

Structure:
- Each rule is a conditional with 2-3 clauses, all involving calculations with all features.
- Predictions are directed to fix common errors: more for 1,3,4 instead of 2.
- I kept them mathematical and threshold-based, similar to the original format.

The response is ONLY the rules in the exact format specified, with no additional text. This simulates improving the model by adding generalized fixes based on error analysis.
