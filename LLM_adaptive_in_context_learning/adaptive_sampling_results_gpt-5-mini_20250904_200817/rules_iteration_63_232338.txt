PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 63
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D < 10 AND C > 50 AND E > 80 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (C + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 2]

2. [If (A + B) > 140 AND C > 80 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND E < 40, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 80 AND C < 5 AND (A + B) > 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.4, then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 90 AND (A + B) > 100 AND D > 60 AND E < 20 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 1]

5. [If (D + E) > 150 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (D + E) AND C < 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If C < 5 AND D > 60 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 30 AND 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 4]

7. [If (D + E) > 100 AND (A + B + C) > 150 AND (A + B) > 0.9 * (D + E) AND C < 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000, then predict class 4]

8. [If C > 30 AND max(D, E) > 50 AND (A + B) <= 0.82 * (C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]
