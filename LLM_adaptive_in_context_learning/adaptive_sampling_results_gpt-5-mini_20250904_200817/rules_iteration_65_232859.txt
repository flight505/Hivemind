PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 65
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D) > 100 AND (C + D) > 0.85 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B) > 0.9 * (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (C + D) < 1.1 * (A + B), then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + D + E) > 1.2 * (B + C) AND (A * D * E) / (B + C + 1) > 4000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (B + C) < (A + D + E), then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 0.35 * (A + B + D + E) AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220 AND D < 0.7 * (A + B), then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260 AND ((D > 60 AND C < 30) OR (E > 70 AND D < 30) OR (B > 80 AND C < 10)) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 4000 AND (A + B) < 0.6 * (C + D + E), then predict class 2]

6. [If C > 60 AND (C + D) > 0.9 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If (D + E) > 0.9 * (A + B + C) AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E), then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND (C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 220 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 10 AND 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND (C < 0.5 * (A + B + D + E)), then predict class 2]
