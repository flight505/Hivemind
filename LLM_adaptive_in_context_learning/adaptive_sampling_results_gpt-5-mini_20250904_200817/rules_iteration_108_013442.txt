PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 108
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND B / (C + 1) > 1.5 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 18 AND A > 10, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND C / (A + 1) > 1.2 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 5, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 5 AND (C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 80 AND D > 70 AND (A + B) < C AND (C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + D) > 160 AND C BETWEEN 45 AND 60 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 40 AND (B + E) < (A + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 80 AND E > 50 AND (A + B) < C AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.4 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 30, then predict class 4]

7. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND E < 15 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 160, then predict class 4]

8. [If B > 60 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND E < 25 AND C BETWEEN 35 AND 55 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 2 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 25, then predict class 4]

9. [If (D + E) > 120 AND B > 50 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 50 AND 90 AND C < 10 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 1 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]
