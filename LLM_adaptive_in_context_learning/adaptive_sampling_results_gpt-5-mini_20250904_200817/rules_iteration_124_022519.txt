PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 124
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (D + E) > 0.9 * (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND A >= 0 AND B >= 0 AND C > 5 AND (D > 40 OR E > 40), then predict class 4]

2. [If A > 80 AND B > 60 AND E < 15 AND (D + E) < 0.4 * (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND E < 20 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 1.5 AND C > 30, then predict class 3]

4. [If E < 10 AND D > 50 AND C > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * (C + D), then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 70 AND E < 10 AND (A + B + D) < 2 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 3]

6. [If C < 5 AND E > 70 AND B < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND E / (A + 1) > 0.8, then predict class 3]

7. [If D < 25 AND (A + B) > 110 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 65 AND E BETWEEN 30 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

8. [If C > 55 AND (D + E) > 150 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 50 AND 130 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

9. [If E > 80 AND B > 70 AND D < 30 AND (A + C) BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260, then predict class 2]
