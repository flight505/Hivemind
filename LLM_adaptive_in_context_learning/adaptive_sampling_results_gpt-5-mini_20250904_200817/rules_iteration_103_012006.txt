PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 103
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 130 AND C < 20 AND E < (A + B) / 10 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 80 AND E > 70 AND C > 20 AND D < (A + B) / 4 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B) > 100 AND C < 20 AND (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230, then predict class 1]

4. [If (C + D) > (A + B) AND C > 25 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 300, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 110 AND C > 20 AND (D + E) < C / 2 AND (A + B) < 2 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

6. [If (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND C > 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 4]

7. [If A > 70 AND E > 70 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 30 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND C > 35 AND D > 60 AND (A + B) > 120 AND B < 1.2 * A AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 150, then predict class 4]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND (D + E) < (A + B) AND C > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 80 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1, then predict class 2]
