PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 6
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If ((A > 40) + (B > 40) + (C > 40) + (D > 40) + (E > 40)) >= 3 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.9 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 15000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (C / (A + 1)) > 0.4 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) < 1.2, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D) > 0.5 * (A + B) AND C > 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

4. [If (C + E) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 4]

5. [If (B + D) > 0.9 * (A + C + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 130 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 2000 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 4, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 40 AND D < (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 240 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 3 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

7. [If none of the above AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 150 AND ((A>30)+(B>30)+(C>30)+(D>30)+(E>30)) >= 2, then predict class 2]
