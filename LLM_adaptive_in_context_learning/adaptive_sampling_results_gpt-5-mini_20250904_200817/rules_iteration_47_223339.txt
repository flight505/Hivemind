PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 47
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D) > 0.40 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND max(C, D) > 40 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B) < 0.7 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B) > 0.35 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND E > 70 AND (A + B) / (C + D + 1) > 0.9 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 90 AND B > 75 AND A < 15 AND E < 85 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > (A + B + C) AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 100 AND (D + E) / (A + 1) > 3 AND (A + B + C) < 0.6 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

5. [If E > 85 AND E / (A + 1) > 1.5 AND B > 50 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 300, then predict class 2]

6. [If C > 0.35 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C > 40 AND C / (D + 1) > 1 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 3]

7. [If (D + E) > 160 AND (C + D) > 0.5 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 4]
