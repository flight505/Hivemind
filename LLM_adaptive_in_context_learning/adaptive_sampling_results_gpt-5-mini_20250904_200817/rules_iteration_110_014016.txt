PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 110
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + E) > 1.5 * (C + D) AND (A + B) > 100 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND A / (D + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 1]

2. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (B > 60 OR C > 50) AND A < (D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (D / (A + 1)) > 1.2, then predict class 3]

3. [If C > 55 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND C / (A + 1) > 1.5, then predict class 3]

4. [If D >= 55 AND (D + E) > (A + B + C) AND A < 50 AND C < 45 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 300, then predict class 4]

5. [If C > 70 AND (D + E) > 130 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 80 AND D > 60 AND E > 40 AND (D + E) > (B + C) AND A / (B + C + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]
