PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 115
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND C > 60 AND D > 50 AND E > 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 25, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 70 AND E > 80 AND D > 70 AND (B + C) < 50 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B) > 140 AND C > 80 AND D < 20 AND E < 10 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 10000, then predict class 1]

4. [If A < 25 AND B < 25 AND (C + D) > 100 AND E < 5 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 60, then predict class 3]

5. [If A < 10 AND B < 10 AND D >= 40 AND D <= 60 AND C >= 25 AND C <= 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) >= 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) <= 140 AND (D * C) / (A + B + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 3]

6. [If D > 80 AND B > 70 AND A < 20 AND C >= 25 AND C <= 40 AND (D + B) / (A + C + E + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 3]

7. [If (B + C) > 120 AND (A + E) < 30 AND D >= 30 AND D <= 60 AND (B * C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 50, then predict class 3]

8. [If C > 60 AND E > 60 AND (B + D + E) > 150 AND A < 60 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 4]

9. [If (B + D + E) > 160 AND A < 50 AND C >= 30 AND C <= 60 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 25, then predict class 4]

10. [If D > 70 AND D > (A + B) / 1.6 AND C >= 20 AND C <= 40 AND E < 40 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 15, then predict class 4]

11. [If C > 80 AND (D + E) > 120 AND A < 20 AND B < 30 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 80, then predict class 4]
