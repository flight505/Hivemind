PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 30
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1.1 AND min(A, B) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 1000, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 80 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 70 AND C < 35 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 50 AND C > 30 AND (A + B) < 1.1 * (C + D) AND (D + E) > (A + C) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

4. [If D > 80 AND E > 60 AND C < 35 AND (A + B) < 2 * D AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.4 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 80, then predict class 4]

6. [If E > 0.4 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B) < 0.5 * (C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220, then predict class 2]
