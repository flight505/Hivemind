PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 20
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If A > 80 AND A / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C) > 220 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND min(A, B, C) > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 1500, then predict class 1]

3. [If A > 60 AND B > 60 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.55 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

4. [If C / (A + B + D + E + 1) > 0.35 AND C BETWEEN 35 AND 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 320 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 50, then predict class 3]

5. [If (C + D) > 0.45 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D > 40 AND (A + B + E) < 1.2 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 3]

6. [If (B > A OR B / (A + 1) > 1.1) AND C > 30 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 90 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

7. [If (C + D + E) > 1.4 * (A + B) AND (C + D + E) > 180 AND E / (A + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 320, then predict class 4]

8. [If E > 70 AND (C + D) > 100 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.5 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]

9. [If C > 60 AND E > 60 AND D > 45 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND C / (B + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 4]
