============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (D + E) > 160 AND C > 70 AND min(A, B) > 45 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

2. [If (C + D) > 110 AND (C + D + E) > 200 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) > 0.95 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

3. [If min(A, B, C, D, E) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 60 AND C / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.9 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]

5. [If A > 85 AND D < 30 AND B < 25 AND C > 60 AND E > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 2]
