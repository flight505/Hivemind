PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 39
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 2.0 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C > 40 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 40 AND D > 60 AND (C + D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 3]

3. [If C > 35 AND C > (A + B + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 260 AND (C * (D + 1)) / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.8 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1000, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.45 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C < (D + E) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 10000, then predict class 4]

5. [If B > 80 AND D > 70 AND E < (A + B + C) / 4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 50, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 75 AND C > 70 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A * C * (D + 1)) / (B + E + 1) > 5000, then predict class 4]

7. [If C > 30 AND C > (A + B) / 1.5 AND D > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND (C * (D + E + 1)) / (A + B + 1) > 80, then predict class 3]
