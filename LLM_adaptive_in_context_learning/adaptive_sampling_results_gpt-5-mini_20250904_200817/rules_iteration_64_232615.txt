PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 64
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 290 AND E > 60 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) > 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) < 1.2, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND ((B > 80 AND D > 60 AND C < 30) OR (A > 75 AND (B + C + D + E) < 120 AND E < 30)) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 60 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 300 AND C > 60 AND D > 80 AND E < 15 AND (A + B) > 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 3]

4. [If D > 90 AND E < 30 AND (A + B) > 120 AND C < 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

5. [If (C + E) > 140 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 250 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 10, then predict class 4]

6. [If (D + E) > 150 AND C < 35 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + C) / (B + E + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 4]
