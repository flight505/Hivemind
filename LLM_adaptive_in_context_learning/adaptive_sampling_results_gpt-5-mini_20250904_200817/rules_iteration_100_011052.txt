PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 100
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) / (D + 1) > 1.0 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 50 AND B / (A + 1) > 2.5 AND (C + D) > 70 AND (A * C * E) / (B + D + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

3. [If (C + D) > 150 AND C > 60 AND D > 60 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (C + D) AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) < 400, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 110 AND max(B, C) > 65 AND (A + B + C) < 0.9 * (D + E) + 100 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 8000 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 10, then predict class 4]

5. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND (A + B) < 15 AND C < 10 AND (D + E) / (A + 1) > 7 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 70 AND 100, then predict class 4]

6. [If E > 70 AND C > 50 AND (A * C * E) / (B + D + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]
