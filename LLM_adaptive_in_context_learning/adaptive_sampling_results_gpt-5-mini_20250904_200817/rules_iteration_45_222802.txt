PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 45
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND ((A + B) > 100 OR E > 80) AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 8 AND (D / (E + 1)) < 5, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 50 AND C / (A + B + C + D + E) > 0.20 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * C AND (D + E) > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + D + E) > (B + C) AND A > 60 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 220 AND 320 AND (D / (E + 1)) > 1.5, then predict class 4]

4. [If C > 75 AND (A + B) < 40 AND (D + E) > 30 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 12000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 320, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 60 AND E > 80 AND (A + B) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (D / (A + 1)) < 2, then predict class 3]

6. [If D > 80 AND B > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (E < 30 OR (A / (E + 1)) < 2) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 3]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260 AND C < 35 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 60 AND 140 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 30 AND 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 2]
