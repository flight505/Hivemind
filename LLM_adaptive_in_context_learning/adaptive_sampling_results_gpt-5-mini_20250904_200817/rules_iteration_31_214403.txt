PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 31
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 130 AND C < 25 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 45 AND E < (A + B) / 4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C) > (D + E) AND (A + B) BETWEEN 80 AND 180 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 80 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 10 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 300, then predict class 2]

3. [If (C + D) > 120 AND E > 40 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 450 AND B < (C + D) / 3, then predict class 3]

4. [If E > 50 AND C > 35 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 350, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 85 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 70 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (B + E) < C AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B) BETWEEN 60 AND 90 AND C < 10 AND (D + E) < 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 140, then predict class 3]

7. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND B < 30 AND C > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 4]

8. [If (D + E) > 100 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300 AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 350, then predict class 4]
