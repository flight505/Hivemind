PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 122
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) >= 90 OR count({A, B, C, D, E} >= 70) >= 2) AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND C > 20 AND (((D > (A + B) / 2) AND (E < 1.2 * D)) OR ((E > (A + C) / 2) AND (B < (C + D) / 2))) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND E = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND C BETWEEN 35 AND 50 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.8 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]

4. [If D > 70 AND (A + B) > 100 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) / (min(A, B, C, D, E) + 1) > 2.5 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 7000 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 300 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 50 AND 2000 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 40 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) < 90 OR count({A, B, C, D, E} >= 70) < 2), then predict class 2]
