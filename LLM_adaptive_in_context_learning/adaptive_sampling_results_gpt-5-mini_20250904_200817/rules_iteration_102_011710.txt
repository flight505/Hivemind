PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 102
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND ((C + E) / (A + B + 1)) > 0.5 AND D > 40 AND C > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND D > 0.28 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND E < 30 AND (A + B) > 60 AND C < 40 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND C / (A + B + C + D + E) < 0.12 AND min(A, B, D, E) > 70 AND (A * B * D * E) / (C + 1) > 1e6, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 140 AND C < 5 AND D > 40 AND (A + B + E) < 60 AND (A * B * C * D * E) < 1e5, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND A < 15 AND ((B + C + D + E) / 4) > 45 AND (max(B, C, D, E) - min(B, C, D, E)) < 30 AND (A * (B + C + D + E)) < 2000, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C + D + E) > 200 AND C / (A + 1) > 1.1 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 1.5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND C = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND A < 40 AND (C / (A + 1)) > 1.5 AND (B + D + E) / (A + 1) > 40, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220 AND A < 5 AND (B + C + D + E) / 4 BETWEEN 35 AND 55 AND (max(B, C, D, E) - min(B, C, D, E)) < 12 AND (A * (B + C + D + E)) < 1000, then predict class 3]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (B + D + E) > (A + C) AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.6 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND D > 40, then predict class 4]
