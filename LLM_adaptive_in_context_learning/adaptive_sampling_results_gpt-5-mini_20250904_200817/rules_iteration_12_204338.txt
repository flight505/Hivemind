PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 12
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D + E) > 1.8 * (A + B) AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + D + E) > 1.6 * (B + C) AND B < (A + D + E) / 8 AND (A * D * E) / (B + C + 1) > 12000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) > 90 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND C < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 220 AND (B * D) / (A + C + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

4. [If (B > A OR B / (A + 1) > 1.1) AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 45 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 80 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260, then predict class 3]

5. [If (B + D + E) > 220 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (C * (D + E)) / (A + B + 1) > 8000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 70 AND (A + B) < C AND (D + E) > 130 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B) > (C + D) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 70 AND A / (B + 1) > 1 AND (A * B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 300, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C) > (D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 50000 AND C / (A + B + 1) < 1.5 AND (D + E) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 300, then predict class 2]

9. [If (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) > 60 AND (A + C + D) > 1.8 * (B + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C >= A, then predict class 1]

10. [If (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) > 60 AND (B + C + E) > 1.8 * (A + D) AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C < A, then predict class 4]
