PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 49
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 40 AND C > (A + B) / 1.5 AND (D + E) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

2. [If C > 80 AND C > (A + B + D + E) / 3 AND (A + B + D + E) < 250 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

3. [If E > 80 AND E > (A + B + C) / 1.5 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 800 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

4. [If (B + C) > 160 AND A < (B + C) / 2 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 150 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 22000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B) > 140 AND D < 20 AND C < 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 300, then predict class 1]

6. [If (A + B) > 140 AND D < 25 AND (C > 90 OR E > 80) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

7. [If B > 80 AND E > 70 AND D < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 60, then predict class 1]

8. [If C > 60 AND D > 60 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 1.5 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

9. [If A > 80 AND B > 80 AND D > 80 AND C BETWEEN 50 AND 75 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 8000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 380, then predict class 3]

10. [If B > 80 AND C > 70 AND D > 80 AND (E + A) < (B + C) / 3 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 6000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280, then predict class 3]
