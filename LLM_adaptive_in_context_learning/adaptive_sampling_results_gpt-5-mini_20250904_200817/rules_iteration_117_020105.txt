PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 117
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + E) > 140 AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 40 AND D < (A + B + C) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + B) / (D + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35 AND C > 30 AND (C * (A + B)) / (D + E + 1) > 75 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 80 AND E < 25 AND C > 60 AND (D + C) / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 50 AND B < 15 AND E < 30 AND (C + D) / (A + E + 1) > 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 60 AND E > 60 AND B < 10 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.8 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 70 AND E > 60 AND D < (C + E) / 3 AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

7. [If B < 5 AND C > 50 AND D < 30 AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 230, then predict class 4]
