PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 96
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + B) > 120 AND D < (A + B + C + E) / 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 25 AND C > 10, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (D + E) > 100 AND C < 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND A > 50, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) > 90 AND D > (A + B) / 2 AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 3, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 50 AND D > 40 AND (A + B) > 40 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 0.3 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

5. [If B > 60 AND D > 50 AND C < 25 AND (A + E) > 30 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 3]

6. [If E > 40 AND D < 10 AND C > 30 AND (E / (A + B + 1)) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]

7. [If (C + E) > 120 AND B > 10 AND (A + D) < (B + C + E) / 2 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

8. [If D > 60 AND A > 50 AND C > 30 AND (B + E) < (A + D) / 2 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]
