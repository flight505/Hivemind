PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 101
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 25 AND C < 0.10 * (A + B) AND E < 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 80 AND (A / (D + 1)) > 2.5 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 600 AND C < 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 50 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.8 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 50 AND E > 40 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

5. [If D > 85 AND A > 60 AND C < 30 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 50 AND E > 60 AND D < 25 AND (A + B) < 0.60 * (C + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 2]

7. [If D > 80 AND C > 30 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 320, then predict class 3]
