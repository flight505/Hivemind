PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 14
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND B > 60 AND C > 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (D + E) > 40, then predict class 3]

2. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B + C) < 1.2 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50 AND A < (B + C), then predict class 4]

3. [If C > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A + D) < 2 * C AND (B + E) < 1.5 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]

4. [If (A / (B + C + D + E + 1)) > 0.5 AND C < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) >= 140 AND (A + B + C + D + E) <= 180 AND (D + E) < 0.8 * A, then predict class 4]

5. [If C < 15 AND E < 10 AND (A + B) > 100 AND D > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 220 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

6. [If C > 60 AND D < 20 AND E < 25 AND (A + B) > 100 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

7. [If (C + E) > 160 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND A / (B + 1) < 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) < 80, then predict class 1]
