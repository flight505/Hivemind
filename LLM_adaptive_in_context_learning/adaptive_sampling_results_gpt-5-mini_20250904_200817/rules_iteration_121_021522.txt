PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 121
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35 AND C > 30 AND D BETWEEN 10 AND 90 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If A / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.30 AND C > 40 AND D < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (B + C) > 50, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 15 AND 45 AND E > 50 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND A > 20, then predict class 1]

4. [If D > 70 AND E > 60 AND B > 60 AND A < 50 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280, then predict class 3]

5. [If B > 65 AND C > 55 AND A < 5 AND D < 30 AND E < 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 70 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 170 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 70 AND 130 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C / (D + E + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 4]

7. [If B > 90 AND A < 35 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 40 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230, then predict class 4]

8. [If (D + E) > 150 AND C > 40 AND A < 40 AND (B + C) < (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

9. [If D < 12 AND (A + B) > 60 AND (C + E) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND A > 10, then predict class 2]

10. [If E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.35 AND D < 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND A < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220 AND (B + C) BETWEEN 50 AND 120, then predict class 2]
