PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 86
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 50 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.45 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (D + E) > (A + B), then predict class 4]

2. [If (B + C) > 1.1 * (A + D) AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) < 0.06 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 320 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 0.9 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 3]

3. [If B > 50 AND C > 30 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND E / (A + 1) < 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B) > 1.2 * (C + D) AND E > 0.8 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 1]

5. [If (B + E) > (C + D) AND C < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 1]
