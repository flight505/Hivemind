PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 81
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35 AND (C + E) < (A + B) / 3 AND D < (A + B) / 4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 140 AND ((C < 20 AND E < 30) OR (D < 20 AND C < 40)) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (A / (B + 1)) BETWEEN 0.4 AND 1.6, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D BETWEEN 30 AND 90) AND (C BETWEEN 20 AND 60) AND (A + B) BETWEEN 20 AND 110 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) BETWEEN 0.25 AND 1.0 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 110 AND 220, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 220 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 3 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) BETWEEN 0.2 AND 1.2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) < 80, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 180 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (C < 30) AND (D BETWEEN 10 AND 90) AND (E/(A+1)) BETWEEN 0.2 AND 2.0 AND (A + B) < 120, then predict class 3]

6. [If (C + E) > 110 AND (C / (A + 1) > 1.2 OR E / (B + 1) > 1.2) AND (A * D) / (B + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + B) < (C + E), then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 10 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 40 AND (C > 40 OR E > 70) AND (D / (A + 1)) > 0.5, then predict class 4]

8. [If B > 50 AND C < 25 AND ((D < 10 AND E > 60) OR (D > 60 AND A < 60)) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (E / (A + 1)) BETWEEN 0.5 AND 3.0, then predict class 2]
