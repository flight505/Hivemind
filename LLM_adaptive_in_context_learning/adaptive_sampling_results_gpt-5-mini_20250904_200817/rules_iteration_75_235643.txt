PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 75
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND C / (D + 1) > 1.2 AND E < (A + B) / 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

2. [If (B / (A + 1)) > 2.5 AND E > 80 AND C > 40 AND D > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If B > 80 AND A < 15 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND E > 60 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 2]

4. [If (C + D) > 1.1 * (A + B) AND C > 40 AND D > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 60 AND C > 15 AND D / (A + B + C + E + 1) > 0.20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A + C) < 1.2 * (B + D + E), then predict class 3]

6. [If B < 20 AND E > 50 AND (D + E) > 0.95 * (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 140 AND B < 20 AND D > 35 AND E < 20 AND (A + C) < 1.1 * (B + D + E), then predict class 4]
