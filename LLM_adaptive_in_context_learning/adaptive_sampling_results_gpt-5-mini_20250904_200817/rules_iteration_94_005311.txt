PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 94
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C >= 45 AND D >= 45 AND (A + B) / (C + D + 1) < 2 AND E < (C + D) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

2. [If C > 40 AND C / (D + 1) > 1.2 AND E < 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 1.2 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 180, then predict class 3]

3. [If at least two of (C, D, E) > 45 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

4. [If (D + E) > 150 AND (C + D + E) > 180 AND A < 0.5 * (C + D + E) AND B < 0.5 * (C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B) > 150 AND C < 20 AND D > 50 AND E < 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 200, then predict class 1]

6. [If E = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND E / (A + B + C + D + E) > 0.30 AND C > 45 AND D < 15 AND (A + B) < (C + E), then predict class 2]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND (A + B) > (C + D) * 1.1 AND C < 30 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 90 AND E < (A + B) / 3, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 300 AND (C + D + E) > (A + B) * 0.9 AND C > 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND D > 40, then predict class 4]
