PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 107
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.45 AND E / (A + B + 1) > 0.20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 360 AND C / (D + 1) < 2, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.8 AND (C / (D + 1) > 0.9 OR E / (B + 1) > 0.9) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 15000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND A / (B + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.85 AND C / (A + 1) > 0.5 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 90 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND D / (E + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

4. [If C / (A + B + 1) < 0.20 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 70 AND 210 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) < 60 AND (A + 1) / (C + 1) < 5, then predict class 2]

5. [If (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1 AND E > 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D / (A + 1) > 0.3 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C) < 1.2 * (D + E) AND C > 0.28 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 1.1 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000 AND (A + D) / (B + E + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

7. [If (A + B + C) > 0.6 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 1 AND (C / (D + 1) > 0.6 OR B / (E + 1) > 0.6) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]
