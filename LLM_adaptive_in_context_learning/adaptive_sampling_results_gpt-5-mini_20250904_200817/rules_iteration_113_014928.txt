PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 113
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (B + C + D) > 180 AND (A + E) < 0.6 * (B + C + D) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 15000 AND C / (A + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

2. [If (B + E) > 130 AND D > 40 AND C < 25 AND A < (B + E) / 3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) > 70 AND B > 80 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND A < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.5, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 160 AND A < 25 AND B < 20 AND C < 15 AND (A + B) < (D + E) / 10 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 40 AND C > (A + B) / 1.2 AND (C + D) > (A + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 4]

6. [If (D + E) > 150 AND C > 30 AND A < (D + E) / 2 AND (B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

7. [If A > 70 AND E > 50 AND D < 40 AND C < A / 2 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300, then predict class 2]

8. [If none of the above strong interdependent conditions hold but (A + B + C + D + E) < 160 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (C / (A + 1)) < 2, then predict class 4]
