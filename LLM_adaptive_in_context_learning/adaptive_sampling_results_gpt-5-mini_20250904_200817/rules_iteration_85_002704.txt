PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 85
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C + E) > 0.9 * (A + B) AND D / (A + B + 1) > 0.2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000 AND (A + B) > 40, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 80 AND D < (A + B + C) / 6 AND (A + E) > 0.9 * (B + C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND A > max(B, C), then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 25 AND E > (C + D) / 2 AND D < (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

4. [If (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND D < 0.15 * (A + B + C + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND A > max(B, C) AND E > max(B, C, D), then predict class 1]

5. [If D > 80 AND D > 0.6 * (A + B + E) AND C < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (A * C * E) / (B + D + 1) < 800, then predict class 4]

6. [If (D + E) > 160 AND (C > 40 OR C > (A + B) / 2) AND (A + B) < (D + E) / 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

7. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND B = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND (A + C + E) < 2.0 * B AND (B / (A + 1)) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 200, then predict class 3]

8. [If C > 60 AND D > 60 AND B > 50 AND A < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 3]

9. [If (B + E) > 120 AND D < 0.2 * (A + B + C + E) AND A < 30 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 65 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 40, then predict class 2]
