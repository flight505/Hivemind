PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 93
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 110 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 12 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 0.1 AND (C / (B + 1)) < 2.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (C + D + E) > 2.5 * (A + B) AND (C + D + E) > 180 AND C > 50 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

3. [If C > 75 AND (A + B) < (C / 1.2) AND (D + E) BETWEEN 20 AND 110 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]

4. [If E > 70 AND C < 10 AND B > 40 AND (A + D) < 25 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 300, then predict class 3]

5. [If A > 65 AND D > 45 AND (C + E) < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 200 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 150, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B) BETWEEN 80 AND 130 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 80 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (A * C * E) / (B + D + 1) > 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]
