PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 9
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 50 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) > 2000 AND abs(A - B) < 40, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 60 AND D > 80 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.8 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 280 AND 400, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C) > 180 AND D < 20 AND E > 40 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

4. [If C < 10 AND D > 80 AND (A * D) / (B + E + 1) > 30 AND (D - C) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260, then predict class 2]

5. [If C > 60 AND (B + C + E) / (A + D + 1) > 1.0 AND D BETWEEN 20 AND 90 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 220 AND 400 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 70 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (C * (B + 1)) / (A + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 380 AND abs(B - C) < 40, then predict class 3]

7. [If E > 65 AND (E + D) > 120 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 380, then predict class 4]

8. [If E >= 66 AND (B + E) / (A + C + 1) > 0.6 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 1.5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 360 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 0.9 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.2 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 2.0 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 400, then predict class 1]
