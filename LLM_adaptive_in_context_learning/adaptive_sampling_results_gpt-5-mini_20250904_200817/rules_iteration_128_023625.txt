PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 128
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (C + D + E) > 0.55 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 2000 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) > 50, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND E > 70 AND (C + D) > 40 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (C + D) > 0.3 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (E / (A + 1)) < 2, then predict class 4]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 170 AND 240 AND ((B > 60 AND (A + C + E) / (D + 1) < 4) OR (C > 60 AND B < 40) OR (D > 60 AND E < 50)) AND (A + B) < 0.95 * (C + D + E) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 240 AND ( (B / (A + 1) > 1.8) OR (C / (A + 1) > 1.8) ) AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + E) < (B + C) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 15000, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND B > 85 AND A < 30 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND E > 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 2]

7. [If (A * B) > 5000 AND D < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C + E) > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 1000, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND B > 80 AND C > 60 AND (A + D) > 100 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 0.2, then predict class 1]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 210 AND (C > 50 OR D > 60) AND (E < 60) AND (A + B) < 0.6 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 300 AND (C + D + E) > (A + B) AND (C * D) / (B + E + 1) > 100 AND (A / (B + 1)) < 1.2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 50000, then predict class 4]

11. [If none of the above conditions apply AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 320 AND (A + B) >= 0.5 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (B / (A + 1)) <= 1.8 AND (C / (D + 1)) < 3, then predict class 2]
