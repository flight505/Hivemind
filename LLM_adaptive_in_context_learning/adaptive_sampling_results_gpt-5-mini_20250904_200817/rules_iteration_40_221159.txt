PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 40
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND E / (A + 1) < 1.5 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) > 0.15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

2. [If E > 80 AND (B + C + D) > 180 AND (A + E) / (B + C + 1) < 1 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C + D) > 300 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 1000 AND E < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) / 5 > 55, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 1.5 AND (D * C) / (A + B + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) / 5 > 45, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 70 AND (A + B + D + E) < 50 AND C / (A + B + D + E + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 160 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

6. [If C BETWEEN 40 AND 55 AND (E > 60 OR D > 75) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 60 AND (A + B) < (C + 90) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If D > 75 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND E < 25 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 120 AND 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

8. [If B < 15 AND C BETWEEN 35 AND 55 AND (A + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

9. [If B > 90 AND E > 70 AND A < 20 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 40 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 2]
