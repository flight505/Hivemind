PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 21
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND E > (C + D) / 2 AND D < (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 35 AND (C + D) > (A + B + E) / 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 320 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

3. [If D > 80 AND (D + C) > (A + B + E) / 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

4. [If E > 1.15 * max(A, B, C, D) AND (E + B) > (A + C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 2]

5. [If (D + E) >= 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND C > 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 70 AND C > 40 AND B < 15 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 4]

7. [If D > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 220 AND 300 AND (A + B) > 80 AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) < 3, then predict class 4]
