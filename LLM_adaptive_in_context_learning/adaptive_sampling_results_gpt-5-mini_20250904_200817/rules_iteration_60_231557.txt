PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 60
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 100 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 3 AND (C + D + E) < 0.7 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 50 AND B > 50 AND C < 40 AND E < D + 20 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 30 AND B > A AND (C * (B - A + 1)) / (D + E + 1) > 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 320 AND (D + E) < 0.8 * (A + B + C), then predict class 3]

4. [If D BETWEEN 30 AND 90 AND C > 25 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * C AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 12 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 170, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 140 AND C > 35 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 25 AND (A / (B + 1)) < 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 70 AND (C / (A + B + 1)) > 1.5 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 240 AND E > (A + B) AND C < 25 AND (D / (A + B + 1)) > 1 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B) BETWEEN 60 AND 140 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 60 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 180 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) BETWEEN 5 AND 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 3]
