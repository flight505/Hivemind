PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 91
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A * C * E) > 180000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND D < 0.35 * (A + B + C + E) AND C > 40, then predict class 1]

2. [If C < 20 AND (B + D + E) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 210 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 1.5 AND C * (D + E) < 3000, then predict class 3]

3. [If C < 20 AND D > 70 AND E > 50 AND (A + B) < D AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 2, then predict class 3]

4. [If B > 50 AND D > 50 AND E > 50 AND A < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A * C * E) BETWEEN 120000 AND 250000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND D < 0.4 * (A + B + C + E) AND (B / (D + 1)) < 2, then predict class 1]
