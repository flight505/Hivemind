PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 120
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If A > 50 AND E > 40 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + E) > (B + C + D) / 2, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 80 AND A > 40 AND E > 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If E < 25 AND (C > 60 OR D > 60) AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 1.2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260, then predict class 3]

4. [If D > 65 AND E < 30 AND (A + B + C) < 2 * D AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND ((A > 60 AND B > 60) OR (A > 60 AND C > 60) OR (A > 60 AND D > 60) OR (A > 60 AND E > 60) OR (B > 60 AND C > 60) OR (B > 60 AND D > 60) OR (B > 60 AND E > 60) OR (C > 60 AND D > 60) OR (C > 60 AND E > 60) OR (D > 60 AND E > 60)) AND (A + C) > 15 AND (B + D + E) > 150 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 500, then predict class 4]

6. [If (B + D + E) > 250 AND A < 20 AND C < 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280, then predict class 2]

7. [If A > 80 AND C < 20 AND E < 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220, then predict class 2]
