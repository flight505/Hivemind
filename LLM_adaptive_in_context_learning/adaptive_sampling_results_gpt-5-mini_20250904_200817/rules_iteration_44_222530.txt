PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 44
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND (C > 75 OR (A + B) > 150) AND (min(D, E) < 25 OR max(D, E) > 90) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 250 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 80 AND (A + B) > 40 AND (D + E) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C) > 180 AND C > 70 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

4. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND C < 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

5. [If E > 60 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND C > 30 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 250 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

6. [If D > 80 AND (B > 60 OR A > 40) AND C > 25 AND (A + B + C) < 1.5 * (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If C BETWEEN 30 AND 70 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 700, then predict class 3]

8. [If C > 50 AND D > 50 AND E > 50 AND (A + B) < (C / 2) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320, then predict class 3]

9. [If E > 85 AND C < 5 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]
