PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 5
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 30 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1500 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (D + E) > 120 AND C > 20 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 8000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 420, then predict class 3]

3. [If C > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 420 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 AND (COUNT_OF(A, B, C, D, E > 80) >= 3) AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 20 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 1000, then predict class 3]

5. [If max(C, E) > 90 AND (A + B + D) < 2 * max(C, E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 330 AND (min(A, B, C, D, E) < 30 OR E / (A + 1) > 0.8), then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 85 AND B > 75 AND E < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 320 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 1.2, then predict class 4]

7. [If A > 90 AND C < 35 AND D > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 280 AND 340 AND (B + E) / (C + 1) < 3, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 320 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 500 AND VARIANCE(A, B, C, D, E) > 400 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 10, then predict class 1]
