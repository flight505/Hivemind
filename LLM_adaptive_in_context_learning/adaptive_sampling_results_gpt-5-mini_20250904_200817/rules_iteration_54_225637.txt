PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 54
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A + B) > 120 AND C > 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 15 AND (A / (D + 1)) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND (C > 45 OR (D + E) > 100) AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) / (max(A,B,C,D,E) + 1) < 6, then predict class 3]

3. [If (D + E) > (A + B + C) / 1.1 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 70 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000 AND C < (D + E) / 2 + 30, then predict class 4]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (E > 80 OR C > 65) AND (A + B) < (D + E) * 1.2 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) / (max(A,B,C,D,E) + 1) < 4, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND A > 70 AND D > 60 AND B < 30 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A * C) / (D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 80 AND C < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 220 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 40 AND (B + C) < D, then predict class 2]

7. [If (B + D) > 140 AND C < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND D / (A + 1) > 1.6 AND (B * E) / (A + C + 1) > 45, then predict class 2]
