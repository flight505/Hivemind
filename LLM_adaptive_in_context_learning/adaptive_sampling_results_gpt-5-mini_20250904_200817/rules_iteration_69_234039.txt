PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 69
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND min(A, B) > 30 AND (D + E) < 1.1 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 80 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.6 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) / 2 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) > 800 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND D / (A + 1) > 1.5 AND (B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.4 AND A < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 50 AND (B + C) / (A + 1) > 20 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 40 AND 150 AND A < 15 AND (C * (B + 1)) / (D + E + A + 1) > 50, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > (A + B + C) * 0.9 AND C < (D + E) / 3 AND A < 35 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 170, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 80 AND B / (A + C + 1) > 1.5 AND (D + E) < 70 AND C < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 210 AND (A + B) < 2 * C, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 100 AND 1000 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) BETWEEN 0.3 AND 1.2 AND A BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 80, then predict class 2]

8. [If none of the above complex multi-feature conditions apply AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 260 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 500 AND 12000 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.2 AND 2.5 AND at least three features > 20, then predict class 2]
