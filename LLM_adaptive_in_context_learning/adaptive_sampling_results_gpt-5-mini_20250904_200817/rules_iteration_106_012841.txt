PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 106
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) > 5 AND C > 30 AND D / (E + 1) < 1.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 270 AND B > 60 AND D > 60 AND E > 60 AND (B + E) / (C + 1) > 4 AND A / (C + 1) < 2, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 9000 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.1 AND (C + D + E) > 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 1]

4. [If D > 50 AND C > 35 AND E < 30 AND A / (B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 120, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) BETWEEN 60 AND 110 AND C < 25 AND (B + E) / (A + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 200 AND A / (C + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 60 AND D > 40 AND E < 15 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 240 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

7. [If A > 70 AND B < 30 AND E < 35 AND C > 35 AND A / (B + C + D + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 240, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 30 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) < 40 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 3, then predict class 4]

9. [If A > 65 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 110 AND C < 20 AND B < 30 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) + 40 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]
