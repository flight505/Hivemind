PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 53
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If min(A, B) > 50 AND (C < 20 OR (D + E) < 20) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND C < (A + B + 20), then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 320 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

3. [If (D + E) > 1.2 * (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND (B < (A + C + 20) OR A < (B + C + 20)) AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

4. [If (B + D + E) >= 140 AND (B > 50 OR C > 30) AND A < (B + C + D + E) / 2 AND NOT (C >= 75 AND D >= 75) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B) < 20 AND E > 50 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 35 AND D < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 150, then predict class 2]
