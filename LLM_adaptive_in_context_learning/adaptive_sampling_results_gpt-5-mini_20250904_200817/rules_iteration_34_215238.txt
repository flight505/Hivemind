PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 34
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 400 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 100000 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) BETWEEN 1 AND 3, then predict class 3]

2. [If E > 90 AND (A + B) > 100 AND (C + D) > 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If A > 80 AND A / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 1.1 AND E < 30 AND (B + C + D) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 80 AND E < C / 3 AND (A + B + D) > C / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

5. [If C >= 35 AND (A + B + C) > 110 AND D < 35 AND E < 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 60 AND (C / (A + B + D + E + 1)) > 0.20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * C AND (D + E) > 40, then predict class 3]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND C > 30 AND (D + E) > 90 AND (A + B) > 90 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND C / (A + B + 1) < 1.2, then predict class 4]

8. [If D < 12 AND A BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND B BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 35 AND E > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 180, then predict class 2]
