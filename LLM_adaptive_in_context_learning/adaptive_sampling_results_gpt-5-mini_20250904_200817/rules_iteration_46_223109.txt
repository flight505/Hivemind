PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 46
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 50 AND (B + D + E) > 180 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (C / (D + 1)) > 0.8 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 4]

2. [If C > 70 AND E > 80 AND (A + B) < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (E / (A + 1)) > 8 AND (B + D) < (C + E), then predict class 4]

3. [If D > 80 AND C > 40 AND (A + B) < D AND E < C / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 160 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 40 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 80 AND (A + B) > 100 AND E > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C / (D + 1)) > 1.0 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) > 15, then predict class 1]

6. [If E > 50 AND B > 60 AND C < 10 AND (A + D) < 80 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B) > 170 AND C < 10 AND D > 60 AND E < 60 AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) > 1500 AND (B / (A + 1)) BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.2, then predict class 1]

8. [If A > 65 AND E > 60 AND B < 30 AND C < 30 AND D < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (A / (B + C + 1)) > 1.5 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 2000, then predict class 2]

9. [If A > 90 AND B < 20 AND C < 10 AND D < 10 AND E > 40 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 4000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260, then predict class 2]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 230 AND 300 AND E > 70 AND D < 25 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 65 AND abs(A - B) < 0.2 * (A + B + 1) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 1]

11. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 120 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 30 AND (D + E) < 50 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 2, then predict class 3]
