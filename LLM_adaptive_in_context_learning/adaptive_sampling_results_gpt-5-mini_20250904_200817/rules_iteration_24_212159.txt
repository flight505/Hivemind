PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 24
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If E > 65 AND E > (A + B + C) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C / (D + 1) < 3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND C > (A + B) / 2 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 10 AND (D + E) < C + 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

3. [If C > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 110 AND 260 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND B < C / 2 AND (A * E) / (B + D + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 120 AND C > 30 AND B > A AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C * B) / (A + D + 1) > 25, then predict class 3]

5. [If D BETWEEN 35 AND 75 AND B > 30 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND A < B / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 140 AND (B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 15, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A * B) / (C + 1) > 250 AND (A + B) > 120 AND C < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A / (B + 1)) BETWEEN 0.5 AND 2, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND C < (A + B) / 10 AND (D + E) < (A + B) * 0.9 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (C + D) > (A + B) / 2 AND E > (B + 1) / 2 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 1000, then predict class 4]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND (A + B) < (D + E) * 1.2 AND C > 25 AND (B + D) / (A + E + 1) > 0.8 AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 1500, then predict class 3]
