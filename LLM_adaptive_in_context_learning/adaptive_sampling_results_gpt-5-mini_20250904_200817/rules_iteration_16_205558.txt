PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 16
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND D > 0.45 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 75 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) < 0.25, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 80 AND A / (B + 1) > 1.8 AND C > 35 AND D < 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (E * C) / (A + B + D + 1) < 50, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (D + E) > 0.4 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 40 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 70 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.9, then predict class 1]

4. [If (B + E) > 100 AND B > max(A, C) AND C < 0.12 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 45 AND (B + C + E) > (A + D) AND (C * B) / (A + D + E + 1) > 30 AND D BETWEEN 25 AND 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 300, then predict class 3]

6. [If (B + D) > (A + C) AND (B + E) / (A + C + 1) > 1.2 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 70 AND (B * D * E) / (A + C + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

7. [If (C + D) > 140 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 25 AND E < 0.2 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]

8. [If (B + D + E) > 170 AND (C + D) > (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 45 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 4]

9. [If D > 70 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) > 80 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND E < 0.6 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 340, then predict class 2]

10. [If D BETWEEN 60 AND 100 AND C < 30 AND (A + B + E) / (C + 1) > 6 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 2]
