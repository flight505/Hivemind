PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 74
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 65 AND E > 55 AND (A + B) > 70 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280, then predict class 1]

2. [If (C + E) > 150 AND (A + B) < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C + D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

3. [If D >= 60 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.3 AND C > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 420 AND NOT (C > 65 AND E > 55), then predict class 3]

4. [If C < 5 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 70 AND 90 AND (D + E) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 160 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 100 AND 4000, then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 30 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 80, then predict class 4]

6. [If (C + E) > 150 AND (A + B) > 40 AND (D < 40 OR A < 10) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 1000, then predict class 4]

7. [If (D + E) > 100 AND (C / (A + 1)) > 0.6 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 360 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000, then predict class 3]
