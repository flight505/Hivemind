PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 70
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D > 40 AND (C > 50 OR A > 60) AND E < (C + D) / 4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 350 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 3]

2. [If (C + E) > 110 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND D > 30 AND C / (B + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND ( (A > 70) + (B > 70) + (C > 70) + (D > 70) + (E > 70) ) >= 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10 AND (C + E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 0.2, then predict class 1]

4. [If D < 15 AND C < 30 AND B > 45 AND E > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 240 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 2]

5. [If A > 80 AND (D + E) > 120 AND C > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1.5 AND B < (A + C) / 2, then predict class 4]

6. [If (D + A) > 100 AND E < 0.15 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 90 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 8 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 350, then predict class 3]

7. [If (B + E) > 150 AND C > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (C * B) / (A + D + E + 1) > 12 AND A < (B + C) / 3, then predict class 1]
