PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 126
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 50 AND D < 20 AND E < (A + B) / 3 AND C > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + C) > 150 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND B < (A + C) / 3 AND D < (A + C) / 2 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 25 AND D < 60 AND E > (A + B) / 2 AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 200, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D BETWEEN 30 AND 80) AND (C / (D + 1) > 0.8) AND (A + B + E) < (2 * C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 90 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 20 AND C < (D + E) / 3 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 70 AND C > (A + B + D + E) / 2 AND (D + E) > 60 AND (A + B) < C AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 240 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 500 AND 5000 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 40 AND D < 40 AND E < (A + B), then predict class 2]

8. [If none of the above rule sets apply AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 260 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 5 AND 60 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) * 1.2 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 60, then predict class 2]
