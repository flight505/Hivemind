PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 59
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (B + E) > 1.2 * (C + D) AND C < 0.3 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND A > 0.1 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 10, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 340 AND (A + E) > (B + C + D) / 1.5 AND B > 30 AND D > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D) > 1.2 * (A + B + E) AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 30 AND E < 0.2 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND (A + B) < (C + D), then predict class 3]

4. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND E < 0.2 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (B / (A + 1)) < 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (C + D + E) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND min(C, D, E) > 30 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E), then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (C + E) > 160 AND (A + B) < 0.2 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 50 AND D > 30, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND D > 70 AND (C + E) > 30 AND A > 60 AND A / (B + 1) > 1 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 10, then predict class 4]
