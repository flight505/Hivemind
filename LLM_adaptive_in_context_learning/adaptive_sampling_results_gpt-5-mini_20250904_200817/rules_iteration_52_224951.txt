PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 52
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 275 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 18 AND (max(A, B) > 70) AND ((C < 25 AND E > 50) OR (C > 60 AND D > 50)), then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 85 AND (C + E) > 140 AND (A + B) / (D + 1) > 3 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 1500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 360 AND (D + E) > 160 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 50 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 1.0, then predict class 3]

4. [If A > 85 AND B < 10 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND (A + E) > 1.2 * (B + C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 70 AND (C + E) > 100 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 60 AND (A + B + D) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND E > 40 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320, then predict class 4]

7. [If B > 85 AND E > 70 AND A < 25 AND C < 25 AND (B + E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 2 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 250, then predict class 2]
