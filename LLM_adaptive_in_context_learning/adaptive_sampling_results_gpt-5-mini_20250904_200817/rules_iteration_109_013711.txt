PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 109
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 120 AND C < 30 AND D > 0.5 * (A + B) AND E < 0.5 * (C + D + 1) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35, then predict class 1]

2. [If max(A, B) > 80 AND (A + B + C) > 150 AND C / (D + E + 1) < 0.5 AND D > 40 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 600, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 0.35 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (D + E) BETWEEN 60 AND 160 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 2 AND C < 60 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) < 1, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 0.30 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 0.8 * C AND D < 0.6 * C AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 150 AND (C + E) > 130 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND C > 30, then predict class 4]

6. [If (C + E) > 140 AND D > 50 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 50 AND A < 60, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 240 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 0.40 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND abs(A - B) < 0.6 * (A + B + 1) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) < 1.5, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 60 AND 140 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) BETWEEN 20 AND 90 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 300 AND (B + D) / (C + E + 1) < 2, then predict class 2]
