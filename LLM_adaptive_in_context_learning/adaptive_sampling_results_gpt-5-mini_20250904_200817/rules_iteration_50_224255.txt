PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 50
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (C + D + E) > 0.7 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND max(C, D, E) > 80 AND (E > (A + B + C + D) / 3 OR (D + E) > 150), then predict class 4]

2. [If (C + D) > 140 AND (C + D) / (E + 1) > 2.0 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C > 35, then predict class 3]

3. [If D > 65 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 4.0 AND C < 30 AND E < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

4. [If D > 75 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * D AND (E / (C + 1)) BETWEEN 1.0 AND 2.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A * B) > 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C < 20 AND (E / (D + 1)) > 0.5 AND (A / (B + 1)) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

6. [If (B + E) > 170 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 5, then predict class 1]
