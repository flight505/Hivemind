PREDICTIVE RULES - INITIAL
============================================================

PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 130 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 45 AND 0.1 < C / (D + 1) < 2.5 AND E < (A + B) / 4, then predict class 1]

2. [If 40 < (A + B + C) < 160 AND B / (E + 1) < 1.2 AND D < (A + C) / 2 AND (A * C) / (B + E + 1) < 30, then predict class 2]

3. [If 160 <= (A + B + C + D + E) <= 330 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 1.5 AND C > 30 AND 0.5 < D / (E + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B) < 60 AND (D + E) > 130 AND E / (A + 1) > 3 AND C < 30 AND (A * D) / (B + C + 1) < 20, then predict class 4]
