PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 78
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) > 210 AND D < (A + B + C) / 6 AND E > (A + B + C) / 4 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 45 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

2. [If max(A, B, C, E) > 80 AND D < 0.08 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 25 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 0.28 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C > 0.12 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 1.2 * D AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 6000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

4. [If (C + D) > (A + B + E) AND E < 0.12 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C > 30 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260, then predict class 3]

5. [If (B + D + E) > 0.65 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND E > (A + C) / 2 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 1200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 20 AND E > 0.18 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 80 AND (B + C) < 1.1 * (D + E), then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 240 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 100 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 9000 AND (D + E) < 1.1 * (A + B + C), then predict class 2]

8. [If D > 50 AND C > 25 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]
