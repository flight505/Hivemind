PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 27
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (D + E) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND C > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

2. [If C > 60 AND D > 35 AND B < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND E < C, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + B) > 150 AND D < 30 AND C > 30 AND E < (A + B) / 4 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 4000, then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 80 AND E > 70 AND (A + B) > 100 AND D < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

5. [If C > 55 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 60 AND (A + B) > 120 AND D > 60 AND E < 20 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 4]

7. [If A > 70 AND B > 70 AND C > 70 AND D > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 4]

8. [If A / (B + C + 1) > 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 210 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND E BETWEEN 10 AND 30, then predict class 2]

9. [If (D + E) > 2 * (A + B) AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 65 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 230 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 10, then predict class 3]
