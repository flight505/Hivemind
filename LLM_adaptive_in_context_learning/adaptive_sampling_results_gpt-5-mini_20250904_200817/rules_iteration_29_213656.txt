PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 29
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 0.2, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) >= 270 AND (D + E) > 120 AND ((A + B) >= 100 OR (B + E) > 150) AND (C + D) > 90 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 5, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D + E) > 1.3 * (A + B) AND max(C, E) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 3, then predict class 4]

4. [If (C + D + E) > (A + B) AND max(C, D, E) > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.1, then predict class 4]

5. [If D > 70 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 150 AND (A + B) > (C + D + E) AND C < 20 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 50 AND (A + C + D) / (B + E + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 3]

7. [If (D > 60 AND E > 60) OR ((D + E) > 120 AND C > 40) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 240 AND 320 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND (B + C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 0.3, then predict class 3]

8. [If A < 10 AND E > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 230 AND E > 0.5 * (A + B + C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 280 AND (C + D + E) <= 1.2 * (A + B) AND (A + B) BETWEEN 40 AND 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 20 AND 400 AND (E) / (A + 1) < 3, then predict class 2]
