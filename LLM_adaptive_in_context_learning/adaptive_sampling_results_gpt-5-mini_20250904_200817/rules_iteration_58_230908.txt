PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 58
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 70 AND C / (D + 1) > 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND E > 50, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND D < 30 AND E < 40 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) > 140 AND C > 60 AND D / (A + 1) > 1.2 AND B / (C + 1) > 0.3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

4. [If D > 85 AND (D * (E + 1)) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.0 AND (C + E) > (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND E / (C + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 4]

5. [If C > 55 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (E + C) / (D + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 300 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 50 AND (A + B) < 0.75 * C + 40 AND (C * (D + 1)) / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140 AND D < 90, then predict class 3]

7. [If E > 75 AND (A + B + C) < 120 AND D < 1.5 * (A + B) + 50 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 320, then predict class 2]
