PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 26
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 170 AND C > 60 AND E < 30 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 8000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

2. [If C > 65 AND (D + E) > 140 AND (B + C) > (A + D) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If D < 5 AND E > 80 AND (B + C) > 140 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 0.7, then predict class 2]

4. [If (B + C) > 80 AND C > 30 AND (A + D + E) > 70 AND (B * C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 7 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 3]

5. [If E > 80 AND (A + B + C) < 70 AND D BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND (E * A) / (B + C + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 230, then predict class 3]

6. [If (B + C) > 90 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 8 AND A < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 3]

7. [If C >= 35 AND (D + E) >= (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 60 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 8, then predict class 4]

8. [If C > 80 AND C > (A + B + D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (A + B) < 140 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]
