PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 84
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (A + B + C) > 0.75 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (D + E) < 0.5 * (A + B + C) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 12000, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND (B + C) > 0.55 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND E < 0.12 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50 AND (D) < 0.3 * (A + B + C + D + E), then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND B > 0.30 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D > 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C < 0.12 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 2]

4. [If (D + E) > 0.45 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D > 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B + C) < 0.8 * (D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 4000 AND (B + E) / (A + 1) > 1, then predict class 3]

5. [If max(A, B, C) - min(A, B, C) > 40 AND C > 0.28 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 0.6 * (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (D + E) < 0.5 * (A + B + C + D + E), then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + B + C) > (D + E) AND at least two of (A, B, C) > 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 8000 AND (D / (E + 1)) < 2, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 320 AND D > 0.22 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 6000 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 50 (i.e. C > 20 AND C < 50), then predict class 3]
