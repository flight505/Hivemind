PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 10
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D > 40 AND (B + D) > 120 AND B > 60 AND E < (A + C) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 230 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 30, then predict class 3]

2. [If (B + D) > 100 AND C < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND (E + A) < (B + D) / 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 3]

3. [If A > 75 AND D < 10 AND B < 10 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 65 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 200 AND (B + D + E) < (A + C) / 6, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 50 AND (A + D) BETWEEN 70 AND 90 AND B < 30 AND E < 30 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If D < 10 AND (A + B + C + E) > 150 AND max(A, B, C, E) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 400 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 1]

6. [If (C + E) > 150 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND (B + C + D) > 60, then predict class 4]

7. [If D > 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (B + C) > 120 AND E < 40 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 50, then predict class 4]

8. [If D > 85 AND (A > 70 OR (B + C) > 60) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND E BETWEEN 10 AND 40 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 50, then predict class 4]
