PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 123
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND ((C > 50) + (D > 50) + (E > 50)) >= 2 AND ( (C * D) / (A + B + 1) > 30 OR (D * E) / (A + C + 1) > 40 ) AND (A + B) < (C + D + E), then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (E / (A + 1) > 0.8) AND (C > 20) AND ( (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 45 ) AND (D / (C + 1) > 0.6), then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 260 AND ( (B > 80 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1.2) OR (E > 80 AND (A + C) / (B + D + 1) < 1.5) OR (C > 60 AND (A + D) / (B + E + 1) < 1.5) ) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) > 70 AND ( (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1.0 ) AND (D / (A + 1) < 2) AND (E / (B + 1) < 3), then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND ((C > 35 AND (A + D) / (B + E + 1) < 1.2) OR (B > 70 AND (C + D) / (A + E + 1) < 1.5)) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 220 AND 300 AND (C + D + E) > 150 AND ( (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 20 OR (B + E) / (A + C + 1) > 1.5 ) AND min(A, B, C, D, E) < 60, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 230 AND 280 AND (C > 45 OR D > 70) AND ( (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 ) AND (E < 1.2 * D) AND (A / (B + 1) > 0.5), then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) > 0.7 AND (E / (C + 1) < 2.5) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000 AND (B < 90 OR D > 40), then predict class 4]

9. [If none of the above complex, interdependent conditions apply AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 85, then predict class 2]
