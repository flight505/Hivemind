PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 125
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + E) > 3 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND D < 0.5 * (A + B + C) AND E / (D + 1) > 1.5 AND (A + 1) * (B + 1) > 1, then predict class 4]

2. [If D > 75 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * D AND (D + E) > 0.5 * (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND C / (B + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 4]

3. [If C > 50 AND D > 40 AND (C + D) > 0.8 * (A + B + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A + 1) / (E + 1) < 2, then predict class 3]

4. [If E > 60 AND (A + B + C + D) < 2 * E AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 220 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 3 AND D / (C + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C) > 1.2 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C) > 160 AND B / (A + 1) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND C / (D + 1) < 2, then predict class 1]

6. [If (A > 80 AND (D + E) > 100) OR ((A + B) > 140 AND C < 30) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (D + 1) / (E + 1) < 4 AND (B + C) / (A + 1) < 3, then predict class 1]
