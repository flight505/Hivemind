PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 99
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.45 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND min(A, B, C) > 40, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + D) > 240 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B * D) / (C + E + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 70 AND C > 40 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.6 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 80 AND (A + B) < 20 AND (D + E) > 60 AND (C) / (A + B + 1) > 4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 70 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 70 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 600 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 50 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If C BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND D BETWEEN 60 AND 80 AND A > 60 AND A / (B + C + 1) > 1 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

8. [If C < 15 AND (B > 50 OR A > 40) AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 4]

9. [If C BETWEEN 15 AND 25 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 80 AND 140 AND ((D < 25 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.5) OR (D > 90 AND E > 60)) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) < 30, then predict class 2]
