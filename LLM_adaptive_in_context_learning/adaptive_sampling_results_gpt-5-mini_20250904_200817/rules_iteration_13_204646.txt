PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 13
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND C > 35 AND (D + E) < (A + B) / 6 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 80 AND E > 70 AND C < 5 AND (A + D) BETWEEN 30 AND 120 AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) > 4000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 80 AND E > 70 AND B > 60 AND (A + D) < 50 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

4. [If (B + C) > 100 AND E < (B + C) / 10 AND D < (A + B + C) / 3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 240, then predict class 3]

5. [If E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.4 AND C < 20 AND (A + B) < (D + E) / 2 AND (B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 200, then predict class 3]

6. [If (B + E) > (A + C + D) AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 35 AND A < (B + E) / 5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 240, then predict class 2]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND C > (A + B + 1) / 3 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 4000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) / (max(A,B,C,D,E) + 1) > 3, then predict class 4]

8. [If (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.8 AND (C + max(A,B)) > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 40 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 40, then predict class 4]

9. [If D > 75 AND C < 25 AND E > 40 AND (A + B) < D + 10 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

10. [If (C + D + E) > 200 AND C > 60 AND (A + B) < C AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 4]
