PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 35
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.30 AND C > 45 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * C AND E < C / 2, then predict class 3]

2. [If (C + D) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.55 AND C > 30 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND E < (C + D) / 2 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

3. [If D > 85 AND D / (A + B + C + E + 1) > 0.60 AND C < 15 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * D AND E < D / 2, then predict class 4]

4. [If (D + E) > 140 AND A < 20 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.2 AND C > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

5. [If A > 60 AND B > 60 AND C > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND E < 0.6 * D AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND E < 20 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) > 20 AND C / (D + 1) < 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

7. [If (D + E) > 150 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.4 AND C > 45 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 1]

8. [If C > 70 AND D < 15 AND B > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + E) < C, then predict class 1]

9. [If E > 80 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.50 AND C > 30 AND A < 25 AND (B + D) < E, then predict class 2]

10. [If B > 60 AND D < 20 AND C > 40 AND E > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 2]
