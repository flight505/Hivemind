PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 2
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D > 50 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND (C + E) / (A + 1) > 2.0 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 4]

2. [If D > 45 AND E < 15 AND A / (B + C + 1) > 0.8 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C) > 40, then predict class 4]

3. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.55 AND E / (A + B + 1) > 0.5 AND C / (D + E + 1) < 0.35 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 350 AND (A + B) > 30, then predict class 1]

4. [If (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.5 AND (C * (D + E)) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.20 AND E > 60 AND A / (D + 1) < 2.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

5. [If E / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.25 AND (A * B) / (D + E + 1) > 20 AND D / (C + 1) < 0.5 AND (A + B) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 1]

6. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND 0.25 < D / (E + 1) < 3.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E), then predict class 3]

7. [If 40 < (A + B + C) < 160 AND B / (E + 1) < 1.2 AND D < (A + C) / 2 AND (A * C) / (B + E + 1) < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 200, then predict class 2]

8. [If none of the above high-confidence interdependent conditions are met AND (A + B + C + D + E) <= 200 AND (A + B) >= 60 AND E / (A + 1) < 3 AND 0.05 < C / (D + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 2]
