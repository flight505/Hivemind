PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 18
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND C > 30 AND ((D + C) / (A + B + 1)) > 0.6 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

2. [If A > 75 AND (D + E) > 100 AND B < 20 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND A / (B + C + 1) > 1, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND ((A > 40) + (B > 40) + (C > 40) + (D > 40) + (E > 40)) >= 2 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.4 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000, then predict class 1]

4. [If E > 85 AND D < 10 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.3 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260, then predict class 2]

5. [If C < 10 AND D > 70 AND A > 50 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 1.5 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 2]

6. [If D > 90 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 80 AND 130 AND E BETWEEN 30 AND 70 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 15, then predict class 4]

7. [If C > 60 AND D > 35 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 3]

8. [If C > 45 AND A > 60 AND (D + E) < (A + B) * 0.8 AND B < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]
