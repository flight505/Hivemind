PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 116
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (A + B) > 100 AND D < (A + B) / 2 AND (C + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND A > 80 AND B > 70 AND C / (D + 1) > 0.6 AND E < (A + B) / 6 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND (C + D + E) > 160 AND C > 30 AND D > 40 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 50, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300 AND (C >= 50 OR D >= 60) AND C / (A + 1) > 0.6 AND D / (B + 1) > 0.6 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C < (D + E) / 2 AND D / (A + 1) > 0.8 AND E / (B + 1) > 0.4, then predict class 4]

6. [If D > 70 AND (A + B) > 120 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 45 AND E < 15 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 240 AND C > 40 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 1.5 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 3 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 200 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (B + C) / (A + D + 1) > 0.8 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND E / (A + 1) < 2, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 210 AND C >= 30 AND C >= (A + B) / 2 AND D >= 40 AND E / (A + 1) > 0.3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]
