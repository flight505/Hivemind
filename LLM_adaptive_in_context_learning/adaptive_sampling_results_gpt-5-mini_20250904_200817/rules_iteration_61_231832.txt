PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 61
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If A > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND ((C + D) > 60 OR (C < 10 AND E < 5)) AND E < (A + B) / 3, then predict class 1]

2. [If D > 60 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (D + E) AND C > 20 AND (A * C) / (B + 1) > 10, then predict class 4]

3. [If D > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (D / (A + 1)) > 0.6 AND (A * C) / (B + E + 1) < 200 AND (B + E) < (A + C) * 1.5, then predict class 4]

4. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 55 AND (B > A OR B / (A + 1) > 1.1) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140 AND (D + E) < 1.2 * (A + B + C) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

5. [If B > 80 AND C < 20 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 15 AND (E + A) < B / 2, then predict class 2]

6. [If (A + B) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 320 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 15 AND C > 20 AND (D + E) < (A + B) * 0.8, then predict class 1]

7. [If C BETWEEN 25 AND 55 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 0.8 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 300, then predict class 3]
