PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 104
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If B > 80 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1.6 AND C > 10 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND D < 10 AND E < (A + B) / 4 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

3. [If (D + E) > 120 AND A < 20 AND C < (D + E) / 4 AND (B + C) / (A + 1) > 7 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 20, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > max(A, B) AND C / (D + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND (B / (A + 1)) < 3 AND (A + C) / (E + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 3]

5. [If (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.1 AND (D + E) > 100 AND C > 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 4000 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND C > 30 AND D > 40 AND E > 20, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 240 AND (A - B) BETWEEN -40 AND 40 AND (D - E) BETWEEN -50 AND 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 10 AND 200 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 40, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (C + D + E) > 120 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) BETWEEN 10 AND 300 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.5 AND (B - C) BETWEEN -30 AND 30, then predict class 2]

9. [If none of the above conditions are met AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 300 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000 AND (C / (A + B + 1)) BETWEEN 0.05 AND 1.5 AND (D / (E + 1)) BETWEEN 0.1 AND 3, then predict class 3]
