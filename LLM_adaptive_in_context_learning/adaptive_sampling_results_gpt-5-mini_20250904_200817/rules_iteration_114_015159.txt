PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 114
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C + E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 1.0 AND D < (A + B + C + E) / 6 AND C > 40, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A + B) >= 135 AND C < 30 AND (E + A) / (B + C + D + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 1]

3. [If min(A, B, C, D, E) > 50 AND (A * B * C * D * E) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) > 1e6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 360, then predict class 4]

4. [If (C + D + E) > 220 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 4 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND D > 60, then predict class 4]

5. [If A > 80 AND C < 12 AND A / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 40 AND C > 20 AND E < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 3]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 140 AND B > 40 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E) AND B / (A + 1) > 1.4 AND D BETWEEN 20 AND 80, then predict class 3]

8. [If (C + D) > 100 AND B BETWEEN 30 AND 90 AND E < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (C / (D + 1)) > 0.8, then predict class 3]
