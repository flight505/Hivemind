IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 40 AND E > (C + D) / 2 AND D < (A + B) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If max(A, B) > 90 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1.1 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 1]

3. [If B > 90 AND D < (A + C + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C) > 150 AND C / (D + 1) < 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000, then predict class 1]

4. [If (B + E) > (A + D) AND (C + D) < (B + E) / 2 AND (A * D) / (B + E + 1) < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND C > 15, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 80 AND C < 25 AND (A + B) < 1.5 * D AND (E + C) < (A + B + D) / 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000, then predict class 3]

6. [If (B > A OR B / (A + 1) > 1.2) AND C > 30 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 3]

7. [If (D + E) > 80 AND A < 25 AND B < 20 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 160 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) > 2, then predict class 3]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 90 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 25 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND E / (A + 1) < 2 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 4]

9. [If (B + D + E) > 260 AND A < 25 AND C < 30 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

10. [If A > 80 AND (D + E) > 100 AND B < 40 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 40 AND A / (B + C + 1) > 1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

11. [If C > 40 AND B < 20 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 110 AND (A + B) < 2 * C AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]
