PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 17
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 1.8 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND C > 20 AND E / (A + 1) < 2.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (B + E) / (A + C + 1) > 1.5 AND C < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND D / (B + 1) BETWEEN 0.2 AND 2.5 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 10, then predict class 1]

3. [If E > 90 AND (A + B) < 110 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND D / (A + 1) < 2, then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 50 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND D > 40 AND E / (A + 1) < 4 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D > 60 OR C > 60) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 320 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND E / (B + 1) < 3 AND (A * C) / (D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 3]

6. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2 AND E > 40 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

7. [If E > 70 AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND D / (A + 1) > 1.5 AND B < 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 240 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.4 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 600 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 70, then predict class 2]

9. [If none of the above complex interdependent conditions match AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 350 AND (A * B + C * D + E) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 10 AND 120 AND max(A,B,C,D,E) BETWEEN 20 AND 110, then predict class 2]
