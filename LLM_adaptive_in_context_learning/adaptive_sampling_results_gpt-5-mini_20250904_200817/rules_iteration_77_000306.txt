PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 77
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > (A + B + D + E) / 3 AND C > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 4]

2. [If (D + E) > 100 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND C < (A + B) / 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

3. [If B > 80 AND C > 60 AND E < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (B * C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 4]

4. [If D > 85 AND C > 40 AND (B + E) < (A + D) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

5. [If D >= 60 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

6. [If C > 50 AND E < 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 220 AND (D + E) < (A + B) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

7. [If B > 60 AND D BETWEEN 50 AND 80 AND C < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 210 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) + 15 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 80, then predict class 3]

8. [If (A + B) > 140 AND E > 60 AND C < 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

9. [If A > 90 AND C > 70 AND (B + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 170 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 40, then predict class 1]

10. [If (A + B) > 140 AND C < 10 AND (D + E) > 130 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 1]
