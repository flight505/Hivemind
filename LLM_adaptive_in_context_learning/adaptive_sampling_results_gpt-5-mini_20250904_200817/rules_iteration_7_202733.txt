PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 7
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 800 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 15 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 3, then predict class 1]

2. [If (D + E) > 160 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (D + E) AND (C / (A + 1)) > 0.45 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

3. [If (C + E) > 0.62 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 200 AND D < (C + E) / 2 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

4. [If D > 60 AND E < 35 AND (A + B + C) > 60 AND (A + B + C) < 180 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 220, then predict class 3]

5. [If (B + C) > 140 AND A < 10 AND 0.8 < (D / (E + 1)) < 1.5 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 3]

6. [If E > 0.4 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (B + E) / (C + D + 1) > 1.2 AND (A * C) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND D / (B + 1) < 1, then predict class 2]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND ((A > 85 AND B > 85) OR (A > 85 AND C > 85) OR (B > 85 AND C > 85)) AND (D + E) > 40 AND (A * B + C * D) / (E + 1) > 200 AND (min(A, B, C, D, E) < 80 OR max(A, B, C, D, E) > 90), then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260 AND (B + E) > (A + D) AND (C + D) < (B + E) / 2 AND (A * D) / (B + E + 1) < 40 AND C > 15 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 170 AND 320 AND (A + B) > (C + D + E) * 0.45 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 300 AND (D / (E + 1)) > 0.6 AND (C / (A + 1)) > 0.2, then predict class 1]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260 AND (B + D + E) > 240 AND A < 40 AND C < 35 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 250, then predict class 4]
