PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 92
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If ((A + B + C + D + E) > 300 OR ((A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND ((A > 50) + (B > 50) + (C > 50) + (D > 50) + (E > 50)) >= 3)) AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) > 1000 AND C > 20 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If E < 8 AND D > 45 AND C > 18 AND (D / (E + 1)) > 8 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 4, then predict class 3]

3. [If (C + E) > 120 AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C > 35 AND (A * D) / (B + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

4. [If C > 40 AND E > 30 AND B < 5 AND (C + E) / (D + 1) > 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 180 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 4]

5. [If C < 12 AND D > 70 AND A > 70 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 8 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (E / (D + 1)) < 1, then predict class 2]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 300 AND ((B + C) / (A + 1)) > 1.2 AND (E < 40 AND C > 20) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1000 AND (D / (B + 1)) > 0.8, then predict class 3]
