PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 41
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D > 80 AND E < 0.2 * D AND C < 20 AND (A + B) < 0.6 * D AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 220, then predict class 4]

2. [If E > 75 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.40 AND C < 30 AND (A + B) < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 220, then predict class 3]

3. [If (B + C) > 100 AND D < (B + C) / 3 AND E < (B + C) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 110 AND 260 AND A < (B + C) / 2, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND (A + C) > 0.45 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (C > 60 OR A > 80) AND E < 0.30 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D < 0.6 * (A + B + C), then predict class 1]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND E > 0.20 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 1.1 * (C + D) AND C > 40 AND A > 30, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A > 80 AND B > 80 AND D > 80) AND E < 20 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 4]

7. [If C > 60 AND E > 60 AND (C + E) > 1.2 * (A + B + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND A < (C + E) / 2, then predict class 4]

8. [If C > 60 AND D > 60 AND (A + B) < 0.7 * (C + D) AND E < 0.5 * (C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 3]
