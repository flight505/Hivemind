PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 68
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 60 AND E > 80 AND (A + B) < 30 AND D < 20 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 2]

2. [If (B + C + D + E) > 260 AND A < (B + C) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND C > 30, then predict class 3]

3. [If (B + C) > 130 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 40 AND 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND ((A + C) / (B + 1)) < 1.6 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 3]

4. [If (B + D + E) > 140 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND A < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 230 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If E > 85 AND (D > 40 OR (A + B) < 60) AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 210 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 600, then predict class 4]

6. [If (A + B + C + D) > 280 AND E < 60 AND C > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If E BETWEEN 70 AND 85 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 45 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 60 AND 110 AND D < 40 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1000, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (D + E) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C < 40, then predict class 1]

9. [If (D + E) > 170 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 40 AND 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 1]

10. [If E > 95 AND A > 70 AND C < 40 AND (B + D) < 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]
