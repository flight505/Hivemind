PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 37
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND ((A > 75 AND E > 75) OR (B > 75 AND E > 75) OR (C > 90 AND (A + B) > 100)) AND ((A * B) / (C + D + E + 1)) > 10 AND D < 0.7 * (A + B + C) AND C / (D + 1) < 3, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND E > 80 AND (A > 80 OR B > 80 OR C > 80) AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

3. [If D > 50 AND D > 0.4 * (A + B + C + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND C < 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND E / (A + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 80 AND D > (A + B + C) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 220 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 4, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (C > 60 OR (E > 70 AND D > 60)) AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If C > 80 AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (B + D) / (A + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 4]

7. [If none of the above AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 260 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 20 AND 500 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 90 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C), then predict class 2]
