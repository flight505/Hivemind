IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If min(A, B, C, D, E) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 15 AND (C + D) / (A + E + 1) > 0.8 AND (A - E) < 30, then predict class 1]

2. [If (B + E) > 140 AND A > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND C < (A + B) / 2 AND D < (A + E) AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 60, then predict class 1]

3. [If A > 70 AND E > 60 AND (A + C + E) > 200 AND (B + D) < 0.6 * (A + C + E) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

4. [If D > 80 AND E < 35 AND (A + B + C) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (C - E) > 5, then predict class 4]

5. [If C > 80 AND D > 75 AND (C + D + E) > 220 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

6. [If D > 80 AND E > 70 AND (A + B) < 1.6 * D AND C < D AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 600, then predict class 4]

7. [If D >= 45 AND C >= 30 AND (B < 50 OR A < 30) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 270 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 3]

8. [If D > 80 AND B > 70 AND C < 35 AND (A + E) < D AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260 AND (B * D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 30, then predict class 3]

9. [If B > 70 AND A < 30 AND C < 30 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND E > 40 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 2]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 240 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) BETWEEN 30 AND 90 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (B - A) < 70, then predict class 2]
