PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 4
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 30 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) / (A + B + C + D + E)) < 0.35 AND ((A * B * C) / (D + E + 1)) > 1000, then predict class 3]

2. [If B > 75 AND C > 25 AND ((B * (C + D)) / (A + E + 1)) > 250 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 380 AND (C / (D + E + 1)) < 1.5, then predict class 3]

3. [If (C + D) > 150 AND A > 30 AND E > 25 AND B < 25 AND ((A + B) / (C + D + E + 1)) < 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 360, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 60 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.5 AND (D + E) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND B >= 25 AND ((C * (D + E)) / (A + B + 1)) > 80, then predict class 4]

5. [If C > 60 AND E > 70 AND ((C * E) / (A + B + D + 1)) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND B < 30, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 85 AND C < 30 AND (B / (A + C + D + E + 1)) > 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260 AND ((B * A) / (C + D + E + 1)) > 80, then predict class 2]

7. [If A > 70 AND (A / (B + C + D + E + 1)) > 0.45 AND C < 15 AND E < 20 AND ((A * B) / (C + D + E + 1)) > 50, then predict class 1]

8. [If (D + E) > 150 AND A > 60 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 65 AND B < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND ((A * (D + E)) / (B + C + 1)) > 120, then predict class 1]
