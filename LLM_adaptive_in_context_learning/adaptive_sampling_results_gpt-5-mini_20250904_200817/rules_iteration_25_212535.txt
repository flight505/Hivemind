PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 25
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) > (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 15 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10 AND C > 20, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + E) > (B + C + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND C > 20 AND (D / (A + B + C + 1)) < 0.6, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + C) > (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300 AND (B * C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 25 AND A > 40 AND E < (A + B) / 5, then predict class 1]

4. [If (D + E) > 90 AND C >= 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 210 AND (D / (A + 1)) > 1.0 AND (B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 40 AND B > 60 AND (D + E) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 280 AND (C * B) / (A + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 3]

6. [If (D + E) > 100 AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 300 AND (D * C) / (A + B + 1) > 60, then predict class 3]

7. [If E > 60 AND C > 40 AND (A + B) < (D + 1) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

8. [If C > 70 AND E > 60 AND B > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (C * E) / (A + D + 1) > 150, then predict class 4]

9. [If E > 70 AND A < 10 AND B > 40 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (E / (A + B + C + D + 1)) > 0.20, then predict class 4]

10. [If C < 5 AND A > 60 AND D < 40 AND E < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 160 AND (A / (B + C + 1)) > 2, then predict class 4]
