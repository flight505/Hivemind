PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 80
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) > 240 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND min(A, B) > 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND B / (A + 1) > 1.3 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

3. [If D < 10 AND (C + E) > (A + B) * 0.9 AND (C + E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 0.8 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 2]

4. [If D > 75 AND C < 25 AND D / (A + B + C + E + 1) > 0.25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 260 AND (A + B) < (D + E) * 0.9, then predict class 2]

5. [If D >= 50 AND E < 25 AND C > 20 AND (C + D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 280, then predict class 3]

6. [If (C + D) > (A + B) * 0.8 AND D BETWEEN 45 AND 85 AND E < (C + D) / 4 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 300, then predict class 3]

7. [If (C + D + E) > (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C > 30 OR E > 30) AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.6 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

8. [If (C + D + E) > (A + B) * 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C >= 30 OR D >= 45) AND (E / (A + 1) < 3 OR B / (C + 1) > 0.8) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 5, then predict class 4]
