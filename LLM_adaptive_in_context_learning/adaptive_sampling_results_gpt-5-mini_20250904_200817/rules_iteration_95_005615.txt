PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 95
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C < 25 AND (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND (D + E) / (A + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If C >= 25 AND D >= 40 AND E <= 45 AND (A + B + C) / (D + E + 1) > 0.8 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

3. [If (C + D + E) > 1.25 * (A + B) AND (C + D + E) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C >= 20, then predict class 4]

4. [If C > 60 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.4 AND (D + E) < (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 5, then predict class 4]

5. [If C >= 30 AND D >= 40 AND E < (D + C) / 2 AND (B + E) < (A + D) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]

6. [If C < 30 AND B > 80 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 1]
