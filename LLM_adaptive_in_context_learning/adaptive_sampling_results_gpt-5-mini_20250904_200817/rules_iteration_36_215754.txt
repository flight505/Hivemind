PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 36
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 120 AND (C + D) < 0.9 * (A + B) AND E < (A + B) / 3 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

2. [If max(A, B) > 75 AND (C / (D + 1)) < 2.5 AND (A + B) / (C + E + 1) > 1.1 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 25000, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + E) > 140 AND (A + B) < (C + E) / 2 AND D < (C + E) / 3 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

4. [If E > 60 AND (B + C) > 130 AND A < 40 AND D < 80 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

5. [If (C + D) > 140 AND (A + E) < (B + C) / 2 AND (B / (A + 1)) > 1.05 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 90 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 3]

6. [If D > 80 AND C > 40 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (E / (A + 1)) < 2 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 700, then predict class 3]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220 AND A BETWEEN 20 AND 70 AND B BETWEEN 10 AND 80 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) BETWEEN 20 AND 400, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + C) > (B + D) AND E > (D / 2) AND (B / (A + 1)) < 1.5 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

9. [If (A + B) < 90 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 60 AND 140 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 80 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 200 AND 8000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260, then predict class 3]
