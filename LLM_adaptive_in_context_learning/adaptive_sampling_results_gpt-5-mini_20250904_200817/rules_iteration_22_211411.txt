PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 22
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 2.5 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 10 AND min(C, D, E) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

2. [If C / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND E < C / 2 AND D > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 320 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

3. [If D > 40 AND B / (A + 1) > 2.5 AND C < 30 AND (D + C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 100, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.2 AND D > 50 AND E > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND max(A, B, C) < (D + E), then predict class 4]

5. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 220 AND 300 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) < 20 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) + 20 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 8000, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 80 AND A / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (D + E) < A AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND C < A, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 1.3 AND max(A, E) > 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 1000 AND min(B, C, D) < max(A, E), then predict class 1]

8. [If D > 80 AND E > 80 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 280 AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) / 2, then predict class 4]
