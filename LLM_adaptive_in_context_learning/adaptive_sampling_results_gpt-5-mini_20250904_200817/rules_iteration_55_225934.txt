PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 55
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (D + E) > 0.5 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C > 25 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400 AND (A + 1) * (B + 1) / (C + D + E + 1) < 600, then predict class 4]

2. [If D > 70 AND E > 40 AND (D + E) > 0.55 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND C > 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

3. [If C > 40 AND C > 0.28 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND E < 30 AND (A + B) < 0.9 * (C + D) AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) < 2000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 240, then predict class 3]

4. [If (C + E) > 0.45 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D < 25 AND (A + B) < 1.1 * C AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 80 AND 200, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B) > 1.2 * (C + D + E) AND max(A, B) > 70 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND (D < 25 OR C < 30) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

6. [If A > 80 AND C < 15 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A * (E + 1)) / (B + C + D + 1) > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

7. [If B > 70 AND E > 60 AND (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C >= 20, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND D > 70 AND D > A AND D > B AND C < D AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

9. [If C >= 30 AND (C > A AND C > B) AND E < 30 AND (C + D) > (A + B) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 220, then predict class 3]
