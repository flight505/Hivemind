PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 33
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If E / (C + 1) > 5 AND (A + B) > 120 AND (D + A) / (B + C + 1) < 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 1]

2. [If A > 70 AND (E + C) > 110 AND D < 30 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If (B + C + E) > 200 AND (A + D) < (B + C + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND D / (A + 1) < 1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

4. [If E > 60 AND C > 50 AND B < 20 AND (A + D) > 100 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

5. [If C / (E + 1) >= 4 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) < 140 AND D < 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 15000, then predict class 3]

6. [If E < 5 AND B < 10 AND C > 25 AND (A + D) < 70 AND (A * B + C * D) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 3]

7. [If B / (A + 1) > 1.5 AND E >= 30 AND E <= 50 AND C < 20 AND D < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) >= 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) <= 160, then predict class 2]

8. [If A / (B + 1) > 3 AND E > 25 AND (C + D) < A AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 2]
