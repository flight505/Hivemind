PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 98
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C) > 1.5 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 8000 AND min(A, B, C) > 15 AND C > 5, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 85 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (D + E) > 1.2 * C AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 1.0, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 35 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 1.15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 220 AND (D + E) <= 110 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 150 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND C < 15 AND D / (E + 1) BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.5 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B + C) < 1.7 * (D + E) AND E > 30 AND C > 25 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 10000, then predict class 4]

6. [If E > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND E / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * C) / (B + D + 1) < 100, then predict class 4]
