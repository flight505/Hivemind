PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 32
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + E) > (B + C + D) AND (A + B) > 140 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 45 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 120 AND A > C AND A > D AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300, then predict class 1]

3. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND (A + B + C) > D AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 200 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

4. [If C = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND (D + E) < 0.2 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND C / (A + B + 1) > 0.9 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 260, then predict class 3]

5. [If E = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND D < (A + B + C) / 3 AND E / (A + B + C + D + 1) > 0.4 AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 160, then predict class 3]

6. [If (C + D + E) > 1.2 * (A + B) AND (C + D) > 0.6 * (C + D + E) AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) > 1500, then predict class 4]

7. [If B = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND B / (A + C + D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 160 AND (C + D + E) < 0.8 * B, then predict class 4]
