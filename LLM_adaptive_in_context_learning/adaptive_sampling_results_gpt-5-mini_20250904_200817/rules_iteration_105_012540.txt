PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 105
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND (A + B + C) > 180 AND min(A, B, C) > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 160 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) > 400 AND (C + D + E) > 60 AND max(A, B) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 45 AND (C * (D + E)) / (A + B + 1) > 200 AND (A + B) < 0.95 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 320 AND E < (A + C) / 2, then predict class 3]

4. [If (C / (A + 1)) > 1.5 AND (C + D) > (B + E) AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND B < 80, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 0.9 * (A + B + C) AND (D + E) > 100 AND (E * C) / (A + B + 1) > 1200 AND min(D, E) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If E > 80 AND C > 60 AND (E * C) / (A + B + D + 1) > 3000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 4]

7. [If A > 75 AND (A / (B + C + 1)) > 1.2 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 60 AND 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND abs(A - B) < 50 AND (D + E) < (A + B) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

9. [If (D + E) > 120 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 150 AND (A + B + C) < 0.9 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 320 AND (C / (A + 1)) < 2, then predict class 4]
