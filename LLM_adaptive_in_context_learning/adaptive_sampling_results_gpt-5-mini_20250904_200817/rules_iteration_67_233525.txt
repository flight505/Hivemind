PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 67
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 160 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 45 AND D BETWEEN 50 AND 90 AND E BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 70, then predict class 1]

2. [If B > 80 AND E > 80 AND D BETWEEN 45 AND 70 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 55 AND A < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If B > 85 AND D < 20 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 35 AND E < 20 AND A BETWEEN 30 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 220, then predict class 1]

4. [If D > 75 AND C < 15 AND (A + B) < 1.3 * D AND E < (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 3]

5. [If C > 45 AND D BETWEEN 50 AND 80 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * C AND E < 20 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

6. [If B > 90 AND D > 90 AND C > 50 AND A < 30 AND E < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250, then predict class 3]

7. [If E > 70 AND D < 35 AND C < 30 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 30 AND 130 AND (B + E) / (A + D + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 2]

8. [If B > 70 AND D < 30 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 35 AND E BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND A < 35 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500, then predict class 2]

9. [If A > 75 AND D > 80 AND C > 35 AND E < 15 AND B < 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

10. [If C > 50 AND (A > 80 OR B > 75) AND E < 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (D BETWEEN 30 AND 80), then predict class 4]

11. [If B > 70 AND C > 50 AND D BETWEEN 50 AND 70 AND (A + E) < 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000, then predict class 4]

12. [If A > 55 AND B > 55 AND C > 40 AND D BETWEEN 30 AND 45 AND E BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]
