PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 28
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > (A + B + D + E) / 3 AND C > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND B < 15 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

2. [If E >= 90 AND B < 15 AND C > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND E / (D + 1) > 1.1 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + B) > 150 AND A > 60 AND B > 60 AND C > 40 AND (D + E) > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) > 1.5, then predict class 3]

4. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 AND A > 60 AND B > 60 AND C > 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 10000 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 3]

5. [If B >= 70 AND (C + E) > 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160 AND D < (A + B + C) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20, then predict class 1]

6. [If B >= 70 AND D < 15 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 30 AND (E + C) > 40, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 50 AND 120 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 40 AND (C + D) > (A + B) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 2000 AND (A + C) < (B + D + E), then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND (A + B) < 130 AND C BETWEEN 25 AND 90 AND (D + E) > 60 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 600 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 2, then predict class 4]
