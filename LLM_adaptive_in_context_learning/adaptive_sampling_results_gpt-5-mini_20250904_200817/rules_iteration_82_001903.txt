PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 82
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (D + E) > 120 AND C > 30 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 800 AND (A + B) / (C + 1) < 4, then predict class 4]

2. [If B / (A + 1) > 1.5 AND C > 30 AND D BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 240 AND (A + C) / (D + E + 1) < 1.5, then predict class 3]

3. [If D BETWEEN 40 AND 80 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 170 AND A / (B + 1) < 2 AND E < (C + D) / 2, then predict class 3]

4. [If A > 80 AND B > 80 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND D / (E + 1) < 2 AND C / (A + B + 1) < 1, then predict class 1]

5. [If (A + B) > 110 AND E > 70 AND C < 30 AND D < 60 AND (A + B) / (C + D + 1) > 2.0, then predict class 1]
