PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 112
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If D = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND D > (A + B + C + E) / 2 AND (C + D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 3]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND min(A, B, C, D, E) > 20 AND (C + D + E) > 0.6 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 500 AND (A + E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 4]

3. [If (A + E) > 150 AND A > 0.9 * max(A, B, C, D, E) AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 40 AND C < (A + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 350, then predict class 1]

4. [If B = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND B > 80 AND (B) / (A + C + D + E + 1) > 1.2 AND A < 25 AND D < 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 260, then predict class 2]

5. [If E = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND (E + C + D) > (A + B) * 1.2 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.1 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 250 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

6. [If D > 60 AND D > E * 1.1 AND D > C * 0.95 AND (A + B) < 0.7 * (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 3]

7. [If A = max(A, B, C, D, E) AND A > 80 AND (A) / (B + C + D + E + 1) > 0.6 AND E > 30 AND C < 35 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 320, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND at least three of (A, B, C, D, E) > 60 AND (C + D) > (A + B) * 0.9 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 4]

9. [If (C + D) > (A + B + E) AND C > 50 AND D > 50 AND (A + B) < (C + D) * 0.6 AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 170, then predict class 3]
