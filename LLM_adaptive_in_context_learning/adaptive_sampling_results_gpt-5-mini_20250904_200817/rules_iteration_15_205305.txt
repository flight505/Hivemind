PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 15
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 50 AND E < 0.5 * C AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 90 AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 1.5 AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) < 20000, then predict class 3]

2. [If D > 80 AND max(A, B) > 70 AND C < 0.8 * (D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + E + 1) < 700, then predict class 3]

3. [If B > 60 AND C > 40 AND D BETWEEN 40 AND 90 AND (A + E) < (B + C) / 2 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

4. [If (C + E) > 120 AND C > 30 AND E / (C + 1) >= 0.6 AND D > 40 AND (A + B) < (C + E) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 4]

5. [If E >= 1.2 * C AND (C + D + E) > 160 AND (A + B) < (D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 4000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

6. [If (max(A, B) / (A + B + C + D + E + 1)) > 0.25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (C * D * E) / (A + B + 1) < 20000, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 AND (max(A, B, C, D, E) - min(A, B, C, D, E)) < 60 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.6 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1000, then predict class 1]

8. [If E > 50 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 40 AND D < 25 AND max(A, B) BETWEEN 40 AND 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 230 AND (A * B) / (C + D + 1) < 150, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) > 2 * ((A + B + C + D + E) / 5) AND C < 40 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 2]
