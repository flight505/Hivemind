PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 129
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D) > 0.42 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A + B) < 0.30 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (E / (A + 1)) > 0.7 AND (C / (D + 1)) > 0.6 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

2. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 45 AND (D + E) > 0.6 * (A + B) AND C < 0.6 * (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 0.35 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND D > 15 AND A < 0.6 * C AND (B + E) < 0.9 * (C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 600, then predict class 3]

4. [If A > 55 AND B < 15 AND C < 15 AND D > 35 AND (A / (B + 1)) > 4 AND (D + E) > 0.4 * (A + B + C), then predict class 3]

5. [If (B * E) / (A + C + D + 1) > 20 AND A < 50 AND B > 60 AND C > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) > 90 AND (A + B) < 0.5 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 300, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260 AND C > 20 AND (C / (A + B + 1)) > 0.25 AND (D / (E + 1)) BETWEEN 0.3 AND 2.5 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 3]
