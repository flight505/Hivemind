PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 56
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND C > 50 AND D > 60 AND E > 60 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 1]

2. [If D > 0.5 * (A + B + C + E) AND C < 20 AND E < 10 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 5000, then predict class 4]

3. [If (D + E) > 1.1 * (A + B + C) AND (D + E) > 120 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * C) / (B + 1) < 5000 AND E / (A + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 4]

4. [If E > 50 AND A > 70 AND B < 20 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

5. [If C > 40 AND (A + B) < 1.2 * (D + E) AND C / (D + E + 1) > 0.3 AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 3000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120, then predict class 3]

6. [If D > 80 AND (A + B + C) < 1.5 * D AND E / (A + 1) < 5 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 20000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 3]

7. [If (D + E) > 80 AND (A + B + C) < (D + E) * 0.9 AND C BETWEEN 15 AND 45 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 260, then predict class 3]
