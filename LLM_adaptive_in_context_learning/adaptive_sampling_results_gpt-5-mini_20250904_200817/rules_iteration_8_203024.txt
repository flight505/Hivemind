PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 8
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND C > 20 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 5000 AND (D + E) < (A + B) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 120 AND C > (D + E) / 2 AND A > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D) > (A + B) * 0.9 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 20 AND E < C / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 280 AND B < 95, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D > 60 OR C > 60) AND (A + B) < (C + D) * 0.95 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 15 AND E < 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 170, then predict class 3]

5. [If (C + E) > 120 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 40 AND A < 40 AND B > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 80 AND C > 50 AND (D + E) > 60 AND A < B / 2 AND (A * B + C * D) / (E + 1) > 3000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 4]

7. [If B > 60 AND C < 30 AND (B) / (A + C + D + E + 1) > 0.25 AND D < 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 260 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B) BETWEEN 70 AND 150 AND C < 35 AND (D + E) < (A + B) * 0.8 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 500 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 260, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + C + D) > (B + E) * 1.1 AND C > 40 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 200 AND B < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

10. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (D + E) < (A + B + C) * 0.6 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 1000 AND 15000 AND E < (C + D) / 2 AND B > A / 1.2, then predict class 1]
