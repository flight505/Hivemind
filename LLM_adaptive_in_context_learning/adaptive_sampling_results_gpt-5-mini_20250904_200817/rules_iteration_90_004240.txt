PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 90
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) >= 1.1 * (C + D + E) AND (A + B) > 120 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) < 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

2. [If (D + E) >= 0.9 * (A + B + C) AND D > 50 AND E > 50 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 70 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

3. [If (A + B + E) / (C + D + 1) > 2.2 AND (A + B) > 120 AND C < 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) > 5, then predict class 1]

4. [If C > 60 AND C > 0.25 * (A + B + C + D + E) AND (D + E) > 40 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (C + D + E) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If C BETWEEN 50 AND 80 AND (D > 50 OR E > 50) AND (A + B) < (C + D + E) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 180 AND 320 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 1000, then predict class 3]

6. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 230 AND (at least two of (A, B, C, D, E) > 70) AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 10 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) / (A + B + C + D + E) < 0.4, then predict class 4]

7. [If C > 60 AND (D + E) > 80 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 70 AND 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 280 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) > 1.0, then predict class 4]

8. [If (A + C) > 120 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND max(B, D) < 40 AND (C + E) / (A + B + 1) > 0.6, then predict class 4]

9. [If none of the above conditions trigger AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 160 AND (A + B) < 100 AND C < 40 AND (D + E) < 90 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 2]
