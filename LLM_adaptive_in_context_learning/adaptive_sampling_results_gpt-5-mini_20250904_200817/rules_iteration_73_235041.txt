PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 73
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND C > max(40, (A + B) / 3) AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 2000 AND D < (A + B + C) / 2 AND E > (A + B) / 6, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND A > 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 20 AND C / (D + 1) > 1.2 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 1.5, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 40 AND (D > 70 OR B > 70) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 120 AND C / (A + 1) > 1.2 AND E / (D + 1) > 0.3, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 120 AND C BETWEEN 10 AND 60 AND A < 30 AND B < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 100 AND 220 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 3, then predict class 3]

5. [If (D + E) > 130 AND (A + B) < (D + E) / 1.5 AND C > 12 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

6. [If (D + E) > 140 AND C > 50 AND (A + B) < 80 AND (A * C) / (B + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 230, then predict class 4]

7. [If E > 70 AND D < 35 AND (A + B + C) < 90 AND E / (A + B + 1) > 1.2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 100, then predict class 2]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 230 AND E > max(0.4 * (A + B + C), 70) AND D < (A + B) AND (A * B) / (C + 1) < 100 AND C < 40, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 320 AND A > 60 AND B > 50 AND C > 60 AND (D + E) > 100 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 10000, then predict class 1]
