PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 23
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 120 AND C > 35 AND (D + E) > 60 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1500 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.5, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A + B) > 100 AND E > 40 AND C > 30 AND (E * (A + B)) / (C + D + 1) > 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

3. [If C > 65 AND (D + E) > 80 AND (C * E) / (A + B + 1) > 400 AND D / (A + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

4. [If (D + E) > 160 AND C > 40 AND (D * E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 200 AND min(A, B) < 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

5. [If (D + E) > 140 AND D > B AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND C < 35 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 120, then predict class 3]

6. [If B > 60 AND D > 70 AND (B + D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 0.9 AND A < 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 400, then predict class 3]

7. [If C > 50 AND D < 20 AND (C) / (A + B + E + 1) > 0.55 AND E > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 200 AND 340, then predict class 2]

8. [If C > 55 AND (A + B) > 90 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) < 1.6 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 2]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 160 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 40 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 3000 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) < 2 AND E / (A + 1) < 2, then predict class 4]

10. [If none of the above specific strong-interaction conditions hold AND (A + B) > (C + D + E) / 1.2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 100 AND C > 25 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]
