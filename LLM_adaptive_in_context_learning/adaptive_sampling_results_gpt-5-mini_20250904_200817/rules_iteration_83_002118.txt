PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 83
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If C > 50 AND C > (A + B) / 1.5 AND E > D AND D < (A + B) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 260, then predict class 3]

2. [If E > 45 AND E > (A + B + C) / 2 AND C < (A + B) / 1.5 AND D < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220, then predict class 3]

3. [If C > 75 AND (A + B) > 50 AND E < C AND (D + E) > (A + B + C) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 260, then predict class 4]

4. [If (D + E) > 140 AND E > 1.1 * D AND C < (A + B) / 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

5. [If D > 90 AND (D + E) > (A + B + C) AND C > 30 AND E > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 70 AND A > 30 AND E < 10 AND C BETWEEN 20 AND 30 AND D < 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 180, then predict class 1]

7. [If D > 80 AND E > 50 AND C < 20 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 2]

8. [If B > 85 AND D < 15 AND A < 20 AND C > 40 AND E > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 220, then predict class 2]
