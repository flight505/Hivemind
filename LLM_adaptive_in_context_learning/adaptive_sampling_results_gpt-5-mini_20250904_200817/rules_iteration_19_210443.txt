PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 19
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 240 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 0.5 AND max(A, B) > 50 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 10 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000, then predict class 1]

2. [If D / (A + B + C + E + 1) > 0.18 AND (C + D + E) / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 320 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 80, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 200 AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.6 AND B > 30 AND C > 5 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 60, then predict class 3]

4. [If (D + E) > 140 AND (A + B) < 0.8 * (C + D + E) AND C < 70 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 300 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 4]

5. [If A > 80 AND D > 70 AND E < 25 AND (A + D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 4]

6. [If B > 60 AND D > 70 AND C < 15 AND (B + D) / (A + C + E + 1) > 1.1 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260 AND (A * E) / (B + C + D + 1) < 5000, then predict class 4]

7. [If E > 70 AND E / (A + B + C + 1) > 0.5 AND D BETWEEN 20 AND 90 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 2]
