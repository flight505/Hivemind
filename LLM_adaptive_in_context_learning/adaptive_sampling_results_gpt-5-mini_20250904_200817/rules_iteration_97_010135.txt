PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 97
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (C + D + E) > 160 AND C > 40 AND D > 60 AND (A + B) < (C + D) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200, then predict class 4]

2. [If D > 50 AND C > 30 AND (B + E) < (A + D) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 260 AND (C / (A + 1)) > 1.0, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + C) > 150 AND D < (A + B) / 3 AND (E + B) > (C / 2) AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220, then predict class 1]

4. [If C < 10 AND D < 20 AND (A + B + E) > 130 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 160, then predict class 1]

5. [If C < 5 AND (D + E) > 150 AND (A + B) BETWEEN 80 AND 140 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 100 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 2]

6. [If (D + E) > 120 AND (C / (A + 1)) BETWEEN 2 AND 4 AND B < (A + D) / 2 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 200 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180, then predict class 3]

7. [If E > A AND E > B AND D > 50 AND C BETWEEN 40 AND 70 AND (A + B) < (D + E) / 1.5 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 4]

8. [If A > 70 AND C > 60 AND D < 30 AND (B + E) > 80 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 10000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

9. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 220 AND C < 15 AND D > 60 AND (B + E) > (A + C) AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) < 120, then predict class 3]
