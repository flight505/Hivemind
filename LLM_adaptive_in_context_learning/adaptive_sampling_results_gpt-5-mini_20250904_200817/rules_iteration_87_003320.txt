PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 87
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (A + B) > 150 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 80 AND D < (A + B) / 10 AND C / (E + 1) < 5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 140, then predict class 1]

2. [If (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 3000 AND min(A, B) > 40 AND E < (A + B + C) / 10 AND D / (C + 1) < 1.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 1]

3. [If (C + D) > (A + B + E) AND C > 30 AND D > 40 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) > 1.0 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 160 AND 260, then predict class 3]

4. [If B > 80 AND C > 40 AND A < (B + C) / 6 AND (B * C) / (A + D + E + 1) > 60 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If D > 70 AND C < 20 AND (D + A) / (B + C + E + 1) > 1.2 AND (E / (A + 1)) < 0.5 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 260, then predict class 4]

6. [If A > 80 AND D > 70 AND (D + E) > (A + B) / 2 AND C < 35 AND (A * D) / (B + C + E + 1) > 40 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200, then predict class 4]

7. [If C > 60 AND E > 30 AND A < (C + E) / 20 AND (C + E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 0.7 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 50, then predict class 3]

8. [If C < 10 AND D > 40 AND (A + B) > 60 AND D / (A + B + C + E + 1) > 0.2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 120 AND 200, then predict class 4]

9. [If (C >= 50 OR D >= 60) AND (A + B) < (C + D) / 2 AND (A * B * E) / (C + D + 1) < 1000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 180 AND A < 60, then predict class 3]
