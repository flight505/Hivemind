PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 88
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If (D + E) > (A + B + C) AND (D + E) / (A + B + C + 1) > 1.15 AND (D + E) > 120 AND min(D, E) > 15 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 5000, then predict class 4]

2. [If E > 60 AND E / (A + B + 1) > 0.6 AND (D + E) > (A + B) AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 140 AND 350 AND (C * D) / (A + B + E + 1) < 6000, then predict class 4]

3. [If max(B, C) > 70 AND max(B, C) / (A + B + C + D + E - max(B, C) + 1) > 0.50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 90 AND 260 AND (A + min(B, C) + D) / (E + 1) < 6 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 8000, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 80 AND C / (A + B + 1) > 1.0 AND (D + E) BETWEEN 20 AND 120 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 150000 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 150, then predict class 3]

5. [If (A + B + C) > 200 AND max(A, B, C) > 80 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) > 1.0 AND (A * E) / (B + C + 1) > 20 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 240, then predict class 1]

6. [If (A + B) > 140 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) > 60 AND E > (C + D) / 3 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 220 AND C < 60, then predict class 1]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 150 AND 300 AND C BETWEEN 30 AND 80 AND (A + B) / (D + E + 1) BETWEEN 0.7 AND 1.3 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) < 80000 AND (D + E) < 1.2 * (A + B), then predict class 2]

8. [If none of the above specific patterns match AND (A + B + C + D + E) < 160 AND max(A, B, C, D, E) < 90 AND (A * B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 5000 AND (C + D) / (A + B + 1) < 3, then predict class 2]
