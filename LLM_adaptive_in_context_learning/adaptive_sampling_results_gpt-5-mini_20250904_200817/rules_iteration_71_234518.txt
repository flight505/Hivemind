PREDICTIVE RULES - ITERATION 71
============================================================

IMPROVED PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. [If E < 5 AND ( (A > 50 AND B > 50) OR (A > 50 AND C > 50) OR (B > 50 AND C > 50) ) AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A * B * C) / (D + E + 1) > 1000, then predict class 3]

2. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 350 AND min(C, D, E) > 60 AND (A + B) / (C + D + E + 1) < 1.2 AND A > 40, then predict class 3]

3. [If (A + B + C + D + E) BETWEEN 130 AND 180 AND A > 50 AND C > 30 AND (D + E) < 40 AND (A * C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 10, then predict class 3]

4. [If C > 65 AND B <= 10 AND C > (A + D + E) / 2 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (D + E) / (A + B + 1) < 2, then predict class 4]

5. [If (D + E) > 120 AND B < 10 AND C > 30 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 200 AND (A + C) / (B + 1) > 2, then predict class 4]

6. [If (B + E) > 150 AND A < 35 AND C > 50 AND (A + B + C + D + E) > 250 AND (C * E) / (A + B + D + 1) > 20, then predict class 4]

7. [If (A + B + C + D + E) > 300 AND A > 60 AND C > 60 AND (D > 60 OR E > 60) AND B < 10 AND (A * C * max(D, E)) / (B + 1) > 200000, then predict class 1]

8. [If (A + B + C + D + E) < 240 AND (B < 30 AND D < 40) AND C > 50 AND E > 30 AND (A + C) / (B + D + E + 1) > 1.2, then predict class 4]
