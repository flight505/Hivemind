PREDICTIVE RULES:

1. If (A + C > B + D) AND (E > (A * B * C * D)/10000) AND (A > 40) AND (C > E/2) AND (B < D + E) then class 1
2. If (B + D > A + E) AND (C < (A + B + D + E)/4) AND (B > 30) AND (D > C * 0.5) AND (E < A/2) then class 2
3. If (A + B < C + D + E) AND ((A * C) < (B * D * E)/100) AND (C > 50) AND (E < D) AND (B > A/3) then class 3
4. If (C + E > A + B + D) AND (D > (A + B + C)/3) AND (A < 60) AND (E > B) AND (C * D > A * E) then class 4
5. If (A * E > B * C * D) AND (B + C < 100) AND (D > 20) AND (E < C + 10) AND (A > D/2) then class 1
6. If ((A + D)/2 > B) AND (C * E < 2000) AND (B < E) AND (D > A * 0.4) AND (C < 70) then class 2
7. If (B * D > A * C + E) AND (A + E < 80) AND (C > D - 10) AND (E > 40) AND (B < 60) then class 3
8. If (D + E > A * 2) AND (C > (B + D)/2) AND (A < B + 20) AND (E * C > 3000) AND (D > 50) then class 4
9. If (A + B + C > 150) AND (D * E < 2000) AND (E > C/3) AND (B > D) AND (A < E + 30) then class 1
10. If (C < A/2) AND (B + E > D * 1.5) AND (D > 40) AND (A * B < 4000) AND (E < 60) then class 2
