I asked Grok code fast and gpt-5-mini to solve

"Nth degree polynomial factorization"

code in comment

üëâinstructed to NOT USE any SHORT CUT formula

GPT-5-mini factorizes 14th degree polynomials 100% of the time ‚ÄºÔ∏èüòØ INSANE!!

Grok code factorizes 6th degree polynomials 100% of the time - (fails to return an answer for 7th and larger degrees sometimes)

GPT-5-mini thinks so long(thinking) beyond 7th degree that it took me 1 HOUR to find its limit

I meant his to be a difficult test lol.

am i wrong in thinking this would be difficult?

or are they really this good?
