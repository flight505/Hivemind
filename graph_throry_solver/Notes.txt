I built a graph shortest path finder ðŸ¥³ --- CODE IS ATTACHED BELOW THE POST---

GPT-5-mini performs PERFECT on 40 node graphs! ðŸ¤¯

graph structure for 40 node is shown in the image

Grok code fast does 100% up to about 28 nodes

Sonnet-4 gets 40% on 30 nodes

Gpt 4.1 only gets 60% on 10 nodes

Models are instructed to not use any shortcut methods as shown in the image

GPT-5-mini is just insane. But Grok code punches way above its weight beating 4.1 and Sonnet-4 by a big margin!
