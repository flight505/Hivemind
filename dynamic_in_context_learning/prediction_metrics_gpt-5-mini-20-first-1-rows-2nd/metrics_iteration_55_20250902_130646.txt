PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 55
============================================================

Updated Predictive Metrics Report — v3.4.4 (post_0081_01)

Version & high‑level goal
- Version: v3.4.4 (post_0081_01).
- High‑level goal: extend v3.4.3 by (A) explicitly handling all‑zero spend / missing‑spend edge cases and CryoSleep‑conditional priors, (B) adding small‑batch (including single‑record) conservative gating, and (C) tightening calibration/uncertainty math so records like 0081_01 (all spends = 0, CryoSleep True) do not become unexpected false positives while preserving recall gains from earlier fixes (0074_01 / 0076_01) and FP controls for concentrated spends (0078_01).

Executive summary — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate failure mode observed (new batch):
  - 0081_01 predicted True but actual False.
    - Features: all channel spends = 0, total_spend = 0; CryoSleep = True; Age 13; HomePlanet = Earth; Cabin = G/13/S.
  - Root observation: model/ensemble over‑trusted non‑spend signals (or correlated non‑channel features like cabin/cryosleep/age) in the absence of spend evidence. There was no zero_spend prior or batch_size conservative logic to temper the ensemble’s vote when channel evidence was null.
- High‑priority fixes (deploy in order):
  1. 0–48h: add zero_spend prior table + CryoSleep conditional priors; add zero_spend_flag and batch_size to preprocessing; implement small‑batch conservative gating and updated p_combined that includes zero_spend/Cryo priors; shadow run on recent batches including 0074_01, 0076_01, 0078_01, 0081_01.
  2. 2–14d: retrain GLM/SRM to include zero_spend×(CryoSleep, Age_bucket, Cabin_deck) interactions and absolute_spend features; retrain calibrators with new covariates; run stratified validations.
  3. Weekly: active learning loop prioritizing low‑evidence contradictions (e.g., all‑zero spends with strong ensemble vote) for audit and rapid retraining.

Detailed answers to the six questions (integrated, actionable)

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- Numeric recap (0081_01):
  - RoomService = 0, FoodCourt = 0, ShoppingMall = 0, Spa = 0, VRDeck = 0 → total_spend = 0.
  - CryoSleep = True; Age = 13; Cabin = G/13/S; HomePlanet = Earth.
- How the metrics failed:
  - No zero_spend prior existed: historical posterior for records with all channel spends = 0 was not computed/used. The ensemble (aggregator, GLM, SRM) relied on other features (cabin / cryosleep / age / homeplanet) and agreed — low model_disagreement — producing a confident accept.
  - Because p_combined in v3.4.3 emphasized channel & pair priors and ensemble fusion, there was still no explicit "zero_spend" term to down‑weight cases with no spend signal. The alpha_post weighting focused on channel/pair counts; when those components are missing or low, the ensemble dominated.
  - Small‑batch behavior: this record appeared in a 1‑record batch; we lacked a small‑batch conservative rule. With n=1, the scorer should be more conservative (higher uncertainty floor), but default base_min_se and alpha_post were not sufficiently adaptive for tiny batches.
- Root cause summary:
  - Missing special‑case prior for zero spends + insufficient small‑batch uncertainty → ensemble over‑trust and FP.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
Key principle: treat no‑spend records as a distinct data slice with their own priors and uncertainty; add small‑batch conservatism; incorporate CryoSleep conditional priors and explicit null‑feature handling.

Concrete rule set (v3.4.4):

- New persisted priors:
  - Per‑channel (existing): posterior_mean_ch, posterior_se_ch, sample_count_ch.
  - Per‑channel_pair (existing): posterior_mean_pair, posterior_se_pair, sample_count_pair.
  - Zero_spend slice (new): TP_zero, FP_zero (decayed), posterior_mean_zero = (TP_zero + s_zero)/(N_zero + 2*s_zero), posterior_se_zero = sqrt(P*(1−P)/(N_zero + 1)), sample_count_zero = N_zero.
  - Cryo conditional priors (new): posterior_mean_cryo_true, posterior_mean_cryo_false (optionally cross with zero_spend and cluster).
- Preprocessing flags (must be computed and logged):
  - zero_spend_flag = (total_spend == 0 OR num_nonzero_channels == 0).
  - cryo_flag = CryoSleep (True/False/unknown).
  - batch_size (records in current batch).
- Hierarchical prior fusion (extend v3.4.3):
  - Compute component weights:
    - w_pair = sample_count_pair/(sample_count_pair + τ_pair)
    - w_ch = sample_count_ch/(sample_count_ch + τ_ch)
    - w_zero = sample_count_zero/(sample_count_zero + τ_zero)
    - w_cryo = sample_count_cryo/(sample_count_cryo + τ_cryo)
  - Normalize over non‑zero components present for the record; if component not applicable (e.g., pair absent) its weight is 0.
  - P_prior = weighted average of available component posterior_means (pair, channel, zero, cryo, global_prior).
  - var_prior = weighted sum of corresponding posterior variances (same normalization).
  - alpha_post_total = (sum of sample_counts_of_present_components) / (sum + τ_total). This drives how much prior vs ensemble to trust.
  - p_combined = alpha_post_total * P_prior + (1 − alpha_post_total) * E where E is ensemble mean (aggregator/GLM/SRM weighted).
- Small‑batch conservative gating:
  - If batch_size < small_batch_min (default small_batch_min = 10) then:
    - Increase base_min_se = base_min_se_batch (default = 0.03 for n < 10; for n==1 use base_min_se = 0.05).
    - Reduce alpha_post_total by a batch_shrink factor (make ensemble less dominant or more conservative depending on evidence) — we use a rule that increases se_combined and z_adj so only strong evidence yields auto‑accept.
  - If zero_spend_flag == True:
    - Require stronger ensemble evidence: accept only if E ≥ E_zero_high AND model_disagreement ≤ σ_low AND cryo_prior does not indicate accept.
    - If E in [E_zero_med, E_zero_high) or cryo_prior contradictory or cryo_flag == True: route to priority_audit rather than auto‑accept.
- Cryo conditional rules:
  - If cryo_flag True and zero_spend_flag True: use posterior_mean_cryo_true_zero if sample_count_large — otherwise route to audit unless ensemble very high and model_disagreement very low.
- Contradiction → priority_audit:
  - If AcceptRisk and RejectRisk both exceed moderate thresholds or if p_combined crosses accept threshold while P_prior_zero_cryo strongly suggests reject, route to priority audit.

Concrete numeric defaults (initial; validate/tune):
- s_zero = 5; τ_zero = 100; τ_cryo = 80.
- small_batch_min = 10; base_min_se_batch(n=1) = 0.05; base_min_se_batch(2–9)=0.03.
- ensemble weights (E): aggregator 0.50, GLM 0.30, SRM 0.20.
- E_zero_high = 0.92; E_zero_med = 0.85; σ_low = 0.05.
- sample_count_zero_min = 50 (to make zero_spend prior trusted).
- audit thresholds: reuse v3.4.3 audit_thresholds but escalate for zero_spend+cryo contradictions.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Zero spend is a meaningful slice:
  - Many passengers with zero spend historically have markedly different transport rates than spenders; this slice can be either strong negative or positive depending on other covariates (CryoSleep, Cabin deck, Age). Treating zero spend as "no signal" is wrong — it is an informative signal and should have its own posterior.
- CryoSleep modifies zero_spend meaning:
  - CryoSleep = True with zero spend often corresponds to different operational outcomes (e.g., not transported) than CryoSleep False. We need cryo conditional priors.
- Small batches are high risk:
  - When batch_size is tiny the model can appear over‑confident; production needs a batch_size‑aware uncertainty floor.
- Operational note:
  - Previously we fixed concentrated spend FPs and undersampled channel × cluster FNs; this new FP shows that adding priors must also include “null” priors (zero_spend, missingness patterns). Missing or zero channels are a distinct cohort, not merely absence of evidence.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
Two‑stage uncertainty fusion extended to include zero/cryo/batch:

- Variance building blocks:
  - var_ch = posterior_ch*(1 − posterior_ch) / (N_ch + 1)
  - var_pair = posterior_pair*(1 − posterior_pair) / (N_pair + 1)
  - var_zero = posterior_zero*(1 − posterior_zero) / (N_zero + 1)
  - var_cryo similarly if used.
- var_prior = weighted sum of applicable component variances (weights = normalized w_*).
- var_ensemble estimated from per‑model SEs (bootstrap or analytic) — var_ensemble = weighted var across aggregator/GLM/SRM.
- var_combined = alpha_post_total^2 * var_prior + (1 − alpha_post_total)^2 * var_ensemble.
- se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(batch_size)^2)).
- z scaling:
  - base_z = 1.645
  - z_adj = base_z * (1 + γ1 * combined_FP_risk + γ2 * model_disagreement + γ3 * zero_spend_risk) * (1 − min(0.5, E))
    - combined_FP_risk = max(FP_channel_risk, FP_pair_risk, FP_zero_risk)
    - γ1 = 1.0, γ2 = 0.6, γ3 = 0.8 initial.
  - p_lower = p_combined − z_adj * se_combined.
- Final shrink:
  - p_final = p_lower / (1 + β * combined_FP_risk * (1 − E)).
  - β = 0.2 initial.
- Calibrators:
  - Retrain Platt/isotonic calibrator(s) with covariates: combined_FP_risk, top2_share, spend_entropy, spend_percentile_by_demo, zero_spend_flag, cryo_flag, model_disagreement.
  - Per‑slice calibrators when N_slice ≥ 150; else pooled EB calibrator.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Persist and snapshot new priors:
  - Persist zero_spend posterior table + cryo conditional posterior table with fields: TP, FP, posterior_mean, posterior_se, sample_count, last_update. Snapshot every batch.
- Small‑batch precommit gating:
  - For batch_size < small_batch_min, require: either p_final ≥ stricter_accept_threshold (e.g., 0.95) to auto‑accept, or route to audit.
  - Add unit tests that exercise single‑record and small batches with zero spends, cryo true/false, and cabin edge values.
- Canary & shadow rules:
  - Shadow run the new scorer and require no increase in zero_spend FP_rate > 10% in canary data; specifically block deploy if zero_spend_FP_rate increases > 10% absolute vs last stable baseline.
- Monitoring & dashboards:
  - Add zero_spend FP/FN by cryo_flag and by cabin_deck, DecisionRisk distribution for zero_spend, small_batch FP_rate, audit queue length for priority audits triggered by zero_spend contradictions.
- Decision provenance & logging:
  - Log and persist per‑record reason_code including zero_spend_flag, cryo_flag, batch_size, P_prior components and weights, model_disagreement, p_combined, p_final and final_decision. This enables quick RCA for single‑record batches.
- Audit triage:
  - Route contradictions involving zero_spend to priority audit queue; label them high priority for active learning.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Expose new per‑record metrics to scorer & logs:
  - zero_spend_flag, sample_count_zero, posterior_mean_zero, posterior_se_zero, cryo_prior_mean, combined_FP_risk, batch_size, spend_entropy, decision_provenance, reason_code.
- Model & training changes:
  - GLM_fallback v10:
    - Add zero_spend × (CryoSleep, Age_bucket, Cabin_deck) interaction terms, absolute_spend, log_total_spend, spend_percentile_by_demo, zero_spend_flag as explicit binary feature, and model_disagreement.
    - Use stratified sampling to retain representative zero_spend records in both classes; avoid discarding zero_spend negatives.
    - Synthetic augmentation: create synthetic zero_spend cases for underrepresented positive labels if supported by domain knowledge.
  - SRM/aggregator:
    - Return score + per‑model bootstrap SEs and expose them in scoring to compute var_ensemble.
- Active learning:
  - Route zero_spend contradictions + small‑batch contradictions to human audit for immediate labeling and weekly retraining.
  - Give these labels elevated sample weights in retraining to accelerate correction.
- Robustness:
  - For small batches, set higher min uncertainty and enforce stricter thresholds or audit routing until calibrators proven reliable for small‑n inference.
- Tests & CI:
  - Add deterministic unit tests for the following cases (automated):
    - Single record with zero_spend + cryo_true + ensemble moderate -> audit/reject.
    - Single record with nonzero concentrated spend + noisy_pair -> audit/reject.
    - Single record with nonzero concentrated spend + clean_pair + ensemble high -> accept.
    - Batch of > 50 with mixed cases -> standard logic.

Updated deterministic scoring pipeline (v3.4.4)
1. Snapshot load: channel table, channel_pair table, zero_spend table, cryo conditional table, model versions, calibrators, deterministic RNG seed.
2. Preprocess per record: compute total_spend, num_nonzero_channels, zero_spend_flag, spend_entropy, top_channel, second_channel, channel_pair_id, top2_share, spend_percentile_by_demo, log_total_spend, cryo_flag, cabin_deck/cabin_num, batch_size (current batch).
3. Lookup priors: posterior_mean_ch & se, posterior_mean_pair & se, posterior_mean_zero & se (if zero_spend_flag), posterior_mean_cryo & se (if cryo_flag).
4. Model inference: aggregator_p + SE, GLM_p + SE, SRM_p + SE.
5. Compute E, component weights (w_pair, w_ch, w_zero, w_cryo), P_prior, alpha_post_total, p_combined.
6. Compute var_combined, se_combined; adjust base_min_se by batch_size.
7. Calibrate: compute z_adj including combined_FP_risk, model_disagreement, zero_spend_risk; compute p_lower and p_final; pass p_final + covariates through calibrator(s).
8. Decision gating:
   - If zero_spend_flag True: apply zero_spend special gating (E thresholds, cryo checks, batch‑size checks). Otherwise apply standard single_spike / noisy_pair logic from v3.4.3.
   - If contradiction or DecisionRisk > audit_threshold -> priority_audit.
   - Else choose Accept/Reject per thresholds.
9. Output decision + full provenance; persist logs.
10. Post‑batch: aggregate metrics, update priors once human labels come in (decayed counts), and snapshot priors.

Validation experiments & acceptance criteria
- Holdout & stratified LOO:
  - Stratify by slice: zero_spend × cryo_flag, cluster, cabin_deck, top_channel, channel_pair; include priority test cases: 0069_01, 0070_01, 0071_01, 0073_01, 0074_01, 0076_01, 0078_01, 0081_01.
- Metrics to evaluate:
  - Per_slice FP/FN rates (zero_spend × cryo), Brier score, ECE, CI coverage, audit precision/recall, audit queue size/latency.
- Success criteria vs v3.4.0/v3.4.2:
  - Reduce zero_spend FP rate by ≥ 60% vs v3.4.2 OR not degrade more than 5% vs baseline on other slices.
  - Maintain or improve previous recovery for undersampled FNs: recover ≥ 70% of previously missed TPs like 0074_01 & 0076_01 vs v3.4.0.
  - Reduce concentrated-pair FP (0078_01) by ≥ 50% vs v3.4.2.
  - Overall FN increase ≤ 10%; audit load within operations capacity.
- Parameter sweeps:
  - τ_zero ∈ {50, 100, 200}, s_zero ∈ {3,5,8}, small_batch_min ∈ {5,10,20}, base_min_se_batch(n=1) ∈ {0.03,0.05,0.08}, E_zero_high ∈ {0.90,0.92,0.95}.
- Ablations:
  - with/without zero_spend prior; with/without cryo conditioning; varying small_batch_min.

Immediate operational actions (0–72 hours)
1. Data engineering:
   - Compute and persist zero_spend posterior table (TP/FP/posterior_mean/posterior_se/sample_count) and cryo conditional posterior table; add zero_spend_flag + cryo_flag to feature store.
2. Scoring engineers:
   - Implement p_combined with zero_spend & cryo priors; implement batch_size conservative adjustments and zero_spend gating; add logging of full provenance; run shadow inference on recent batches (must include 0074_01, 0076_01, 0078_01, 0081_01).
   - Add unit tests for single‑record batches and zero_spend cases.
3. ML:
   - Retrain GLM_fallback v10 including zero_spend×(cryo, age_bucket, cabin_deck) interactions; retrain calibrators with new covariates; produce shadow model.
4. Ops/SRE:
   - Add CI checks for zero_spend FP_rate canary and small‑batch gating; implement staged rollout controls.
5. Product/ops:
   - Define human audit instructions for zero_spend + cryo contradictions (what signals to look for).
6. Monitoring:
   - Add dashboard panels for zero_spend FP/FN by cryo_flag, small_batch performance, and priority_audit backlog.

How v3.4.4 would handle 0081_01 (concrete flow)
1. Feature extraction: zero_spend_flag = True (total_spend = 0); cryo_flag = True; Age 13; cabin_deck = G.
2. Lookup priors: posterior_mean_zero and posterior_mean_cryo_true checked. If sample_count_zero and sample_count_cryo sufficient, P_prior will give weight to zero_spend and cryo components.
3. Ensemble: E computed from models (may have been high in original run).
4. alpha_post_total computed: if zero_spend & cryo sample counts reasonable, alpha_post_total gives meaningful weight to P_prior (likely low if historically zero_spend false positives are high).
5. Because batch_size = 1 (< small_batch_min), base_min_se raised (0.05) and z_adj increased; p_lower / p_final will be more conservative.
6. Decision rules:
   - If P_prior_zero_cryo indicates low transport probability OR if sample_count_zero ≥ sample_count_zero_min and posterior_mean_zero low → p_combined shifts toward reject; if conflicting signals (ensemble high vs prior low) → priority_audit.
   - If posterior_zero absent/low_sample_count and ensemble E ≥ E_zero_high (0.92) with model_disagreement ≤ σ_low, then accept; otherwise audit.
7. Net effect: 0081_01 would be routed to priority_audit or rejected rather than auto‑accept (reducing FP probability).

Expected tradeoffs & mitigations
- Tradeoffs:
  - Additional priors (zero_spend, cryo) and small‑batch conservatism will increase audit volume (priority queue) and may slightly reduce recall in some rare real positive zero_spend cases.
- Mitigations:
  - Active learning to convert audits into labels and retrain weekly to reduce audit load over time.
  - Staged rollout and canary thresholds to block regressions.
  - Targeted retraining for zero_spend positives (if legitimate) to improve discrimination.

Deliverables (next artifacts)
- Deterministic scorer pseudocode + unit tests implementing v3.4.4 rules: zero_spend priors, cryo priors, small_batch gating, p_combined adjustments.
- zero_spend & cryo posterior table generation script and retention/decay process.
- Shadow retrain: GLM_fallback v10 (zero_spend interactions) + stratified validation report.
- LOO validation comparing v3.3…v3.4.4 with operating points and parameter sweeps.
- Audit log schema and CI precommit rules for zero_spend canary and small_batch tests.
- 72‑hour implementation checklist (owners, artifacts, canary criteria).

One‑line summary
v3.4.4 augments v3.4.3 with explicit zero_spend and CryoSleep priors plus small‑batch conservative gating and recalibrated uncertainty — preventing FPs like 0081_01 while preserving earlier gains on concentrated spends and undersampled slices.

Recommended immediate next action
- I can either:
  1) produce the deterministic scorer skeleton (Python pseudocode) + unit tests for v3.4.4 now (recommended), OR
  2) run the shadow rerun across last N batches (include 0074_01, 0076_01, 0078_01, 0081_01) and return stratified validation output + suggested operating point.
Which would you like me to do first?

If you want, I can include the concise pseudocode for the new scorer and a minimal unit test matrix in my next message.
