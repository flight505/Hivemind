PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 48
============================================================

Updated Predictive Metrics Report — v3.3.2 (post_0071_01)

VERSION & GOAL
- Version: v3.3.2 (post_0071_01)
- Goal: eliminate recent false positives (0070_01 VRDeck medium spike, 0071_01 FoodCourt extreme spike) while preserving rescue for true positives like 0069_01 (RoomService extreme spike). Make batch decisions robust to channel semantics that vary by demographic and spend-shape, add explicit FP-risk signals, tighten single_spike routing, and introduce audit gating for ambiguous/high-risk patterns.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate problem: A new FP (0071_01) shows that our "extreme_single_spike → rescue" pathway is too permissive across channels. The system allowed an extreme FoodCourt spike (top_share ≈ 0.97) to be accepted as transported even though, in this cohort (Age 17), FoodCourt spikes are frequently non‑transportation (recreational) patterns.
- Compound failure mode (systemic):
  1. No explicit FP_risk in ChannelReliability results in across-the-board rescue allowances.
  2. Extreme rescue policy was global (applied to many channels) rather than channel‑aware.
  3. GLM/SRM training lacked targeted negatives for extreme FoodCourt/VRDeck patterns in young cohorts → model overconfidence.
  4. Missing/unused spend-shape signals (top2_share, spend_entropy, channel_percentile) and demographic × channel interactions.
- Top immediate priorities (deploy in order):
  1. Short (24–72h): compute per (channel,cluster) FP_risk and add it to scorer; change extreme rescue to be channel-aware (whitelist + FP_risk gates); add spend_entropy and top2_share flags to preprocessor; retrain GLM with negative oversampling for FoodCourt & VRDeck and deploy in shadow.
  2. Medium (1–14d): implement ChannelReliabilitySigned v2 (hierarchical EB + FP_risk), DecisionRisk audit routing, per‑channel asymmetry in attenuation multipliers, and tighten medium/exreme single_spike rules.
  3. Long: active learning loop (priority audits feed retraining), per‑channel evolving priors, continuous reweighting and monitoring.

ANSWERS TO THE SIX QUESTIONS

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- Case facts for 0071_01:
  - Spends: RoomService=16, FoodCourt=2165, VRDeck=52 → total = 2233.
  - top_channel = FoodCourt, top_contrib_share ≈ 2165/2233 ≈ 0.9695 (extreme_single_spike ≥0.95).
  - top2_share ≈ (2165+52)/2233 ≈ 0.9928 (very concentrated top2).
  - Age = 17 (young cohort), CryoSleep = False.
- How metrics failed:
  - Extreme-spike rescue logic was applied generically; no per-channel FP_risk or per-age adjustment blocked FoodCourt rescue.
  - Aggregator relaxation allowed a dominant FoodCourt logit to push decision to True.
  - GLM/SRM over‑confident due to training set blind spots (insufficient negative examples for high FoodCourt in <25).
  - No spend-shape gating: high top2_share & very low entropy indicate anomalous concentrated behavior that should increase skepticism.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
- Introduce FP_risk(channel, cluster, spend_bucket) and make it a primary gating input.
  - FP_risk = smoothed( FP_count / (TP_count + FP_count) ) with Laplace smoothing s (default 5) and exponential time decay.
- Make single_spike granular and channel-aware:
  - Bands: low (0.50–0.70), medium (0.70–0.95), extreme (≥0.95).
  - Per-band consensus rules (default, tuneable):
    - Extreme: allow rescue only if channel_rescue_allowed(channel) AND FP_risk ≤ 0.10 AND (aggregator_p_lower≥0.70 AND (GLM_p≥0.60 OR SRM≥0.80)). If FP_risk in (0.10,0.25] require BOTH GLM_p≥0.65 AND SRM≥0.85.
    - Medium: require aggregator_p_lower≥0.80 AND (GLM_p≥0.65 OR SRM≥0.80); if FP_risk>0.10, require BOTH.
    - Low: require 2/3 strong consensus (aggregator_p_lower≥0.85, GLM_p≥0.70, SRM_p≥0.85) or audit.
- Channel rescue metadata:
  - Maintain per-channel rescue_allow flag and rescue_severity_limit. Default: RoomService: allowed (more permissive), FoodCourt/VRDeck: not automatically allowed; require FP_risk ≤ 0.05 and strong model consensus.
- Age-aware tightening:
  - For Age < 25, scale FP_risk by 1.15–1.25 (or increase model thresholds by +0.05) for channels historically showing recreational spikes (FoodCourt, VRDeck, ShoppingMall).
- DecisionRisk & audit gating:
  - Compute DecisionRisk = 0.45*disagreement_ratio + 0.25*dir_uncertainty + 0.15*spend_extremeness + 0.15*FP_risk, where:
    - disagreement_ratio = (#models disagreeing on positive / 3),
    - dir_uncertainty = 1 - |mean_cluster_logodds| normalized,
    - spend_extremeness = (top_contrib_share − 0.5)/0.5 clamped [0,1].
  - If DecisionRisk > 0.35 → route to audit/abstain instead of auto-accept.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Channel semantics are conditional on demographics:
  - FoodCourt spikes in younger cohorts often indicate recreational behavior and a lower transport probability.
  - RoomService extremes are more likely to be transport-relevant for middle-aged adults.
- Two-channel concentration (top2_share very high) often indicates either bill-splitting behavior or concentrated anomalous transactions that require additional scrutiny — it is not equivalent to a single extreme channel.
- Channel polarity flips across Age/Cabin buckets frequently enough to require hierarchical modeling (channel×age×cabin interactions) rather than global channel effects.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Two-stage calibration retained but with FP_risk-aware SE inflation and z-scaling:
  - predicted_se_final = max(base_pred_se, base_min_se*(1 + anomaly_scale)*(1 + dir_uncertainty_penalty)) + fp_risk * se_fp_scale (se_fp_scale default = 0.20).
  - z_for_p_lower = base_z * (1 + FP_risk*1.2 + dir_uncertainty*0.8), base_z = 1.645.
  - Shrink p_final toward prior when FP_risk elevated: p_final = p_cal / (1 + 0.3 * FP_risk).
  - Only apply per-channel calibration offsets if channel_count ≥ 150; otherwise use shrunk cluster offset.
  - Retrain Platt calibrator with FP_risk and spend_shape features as covariates.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Persist and version channel×cluster tables with TP_count, FP_count, FP_risk, posterior_mean, posterior_CI, sample_count, q_C_k, and rescue_allow metadata.
- Pre-commit checks (fail build / staged rollout triggers):
  - Per-channel medium_single_spike accept rate ≤ historical_baseline*(1 + 0.10).
  - If any channel FP_risk increases by > 0.05 since last snapshot → stage rollout and manual review.
  - Block if extreme_single_spike predicted False while cluster_posterior_mean ≥ 0.80 (safety).
- Audit queue triggers:
  - medium single_spike predicted True with FP_risk ≥ 0.15 → priority audit.
  - top2_share > 0.95 + contradictory cluster_dir signs → priority audit.
  - DecisionRisk > 0.35 → audit.
- Dashboards: per_channel_per_age_bucket FN/FP, medium/exreme accept rates, FP_risk trend, audit counts/latency.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- ChannelReliabilitySigned v2:
  - Maintain Beta posterior for P(transported | top_channel=C, cluster=k) AND FP_count, TP_count with Laplace smoothing s=5 and weekly half-life decay. Store posterior samples and FP_risk.
  - Provide an API with channel_rescue_allow flag computed from historical TP/FP and effect stability.
- Model updates:
  - GLM_fallback v6: add top_channel×Age_bucket, top_channel×CryoSleep, top_channel×Cabin_deck interactions; add spend_shape features: top2_share, spend_entropy, num_nonzero_channels, top_channel_percentile, channel_FP_risk; oversample negatives for channels with historical FPs (FoodCourt, VRDeck).
  - SRM v3: include channel posteriors & FP_risk; return SRM_score + bootstrap SE.
  - CoverageGuard retrain: SE predictor that includes FP_risk and spend_shape features.
- Edge detectors:
  - top2_share flag (>0.95), low_entropy flag (<0.25), extreme_percentile flag (top_channel_spend percentile > 99.9 within demographic group), contradiction flag (top2 channels have opposing cluster_dir signs).
- Active learning:
  - Route priority audits into a labeled buffer and reweight retraining for channels with high FP_risk; short retrain cadence (weekly) for hot channels.

CASE DIAGNOSIS — 0071_01 (what happened)
- Passenger snapshot:
  - RoomService 16, FoodCourt 2165, ShoppingMall 0, Spa 0, VRDeck 52; top_channel = FoodCourt (top_share ≈ 0.9695, extreme), top2_share ≈ 0.9928.
  - Age 17, CryoSleep False, Cabin F/14/P, HomePlanet Earth.
- Likely scoring path:
  - Aggregator produced a strong positive logit from extreme FoodCourt concentration.
  - v3.3 global extreme rescue allowed acceptance without per-channel safeguards.
  - GLM/SRM concurred (or at least one high) due to lack of targeted negatives for FoodCourt spikes in young cohorts → consensus → predicted True.
  - Actual False implies FoodCourt extremes in this demographic are frequently non‑transport patterns — our prior for FoodCourt is mis-specified at cluster level.
- Key numeric indicators: extreme single_spike (0.9695), top2_share very high (0.9928), Age 17 (young), low spend entropy — should have raised DecisionRisk.

DECISION-RULE CHANGES (concrete, v3.3.2)
- FP_risk computation:
  - Over sliding window with exponential decay λ (weekly half-life), compute TP_kC and FP_kC where top_channel==C and top_contrib_share>q_C_k.
  - FP_risk_kC = (FP_kC + s) / (TP_kC + FP_kC + 2*s), s=5 default.
- Channel rescue policy:
  - Build per-channel rescue_allow boolean and rescue_thresholds determined by historical TP/FP and effect stability.
  - Default: RoomService: rescue_allow = true (moderate leniency); FoodCourt/VRDeck/ShoppingMall: rescue_allow = false (require stronger proof).
  - Auto-rescue path allowed only when rescue_allow==true AND FP_risk ≤ 0.10 (or per-channel tuned).
- Single_spike routing (defaults):
  - low: [0.50–0.70): strict consensus → audit otherwise.
  - medium: [0.70–0.95): aggregator_p_lower ≥ 0.80 AND (GLM_p ≥ 0.65 OR SRM ≥ 0.80); if FP_risk>0.10 require BOTH or audit.
  - extreme: ≥0.95: allow rescue only when rescue_allow(channel) OR FP_risk ≤ 0.05; else require aggregator_p_lower ≥ 0.85 AND GLM_p ≥ 0.70 AND SRM ≥ 0.90 OR audit.
- Spend-shape contradictions:
  - If top2_share > 0.95 and top_channels have opposing cluster_dir_signs → audit.
  - If spend_entropy < 0.25 → increase required GLM/SRM thresholds by +0.05.
- Age-sensitive scaling:
  - If Age < 25 and channel ∈ {FoodCourt, VRDeck, ShoppingMall} → multiply FP_risk by 1.25 (or add +0.05 to required GLM/SRM thresholds).

CALIBRATION ADJUSTMENTS
- SE and z-scaling:
  - se_logit_final = max(base_pred_se, base_min_se*(1 + anomaly_scale)*(1 + dir_uncertainty_penalty)) + fp_risk * 0.20
  - z = base_z * (1 + FP_risk*1.2 + dir_uncertainty*0.8) where base_z = 1.645
- Probability shrink:
  - p_final = p_cal / (1 + 0.3 * FP_risk)
- Per-channel offsets only if channel_count ≥ 150; otherwise use shrunk cluster offset.
- Retrain Platt (and isotonic where useful) including FP_risk and spend_shape covariates.

CONSISTENCY & MONITORING
- Persist versioned channel×cluster tables with columns: TP_count, FP_count, FP_risk, posterior_mean, posterior_logodds_CI, sample_count, q_C_k, rescue_allow.
- Precommit checks:
  - medium_single_spike_accept_rate_by_channel ≤ baseline*(1 + 0.10)
  - FP_risk delta > 0.05 since last snapshot → staged deploy + manual review.
  - Block if extreme_single_spike predicted False and cluster_posterior_mean ≥ 0.80.
- Dashboards & alerts:
  - Per-channel × Age_bucket FP_rate/FN_rate, medium/exreme accept rates, FP_risk trends, priority audits, audit latency.
  - Emergency alert: any channel with FP_risk > 0.30 and daily FP_count increase > 10.
- Audit queue: prioritize DecisionRisk > 0.35, medium_single_spike predicted True with FP_risk≥0.15, top2_share>0.95 with ambiguous direction.

MODEL & FEATURE UPDATES
- ChannelReliabilitySigned v2:
  - Beta posterior for P(transported | top_channel=C, cluster=k) with Laplace s=5 and EB shrinkage τ=50.
  - Persist posterior samples for deterministic reproducibility.
- GLM_fallback v6:
  - Features added: top_channel one-hot, top_channel×Age_bucket, top_channel×CryoSleep, top_channel×Cabin_deck interactions; top2_share, spend_entropy, num_nonzero_channels, top_channel_percentile, channel_FP_risk.
  - Oversample negatives for channels with high historical FP (FoodCourt, VRDeck).
  - Output p_mean and bootstrap SE.
- SRM v3:
  - Include channel posteriors & FP_risk and return SRM_score with CI.
- CoverageGuard retraining:
  - Predict SE including FP_risk and spend_shape features.
- Edge detectors:
  - top2_share_flag, low_entropy_flag, extreme_percentile_flag, contradiction_flag.
- Active learning:
  - Route priority audits to human labels and feed them back into training sets (high importance weight).

DETERMINISTIC SCORING PIPELINE (v3.3.2)
1. Snapshot load: quantiles, cluster centroids, ChannelReliabilitySigned table (including FP_risk, rescue_allow), GLM/SRM versions, per_channel calibration maps, deterministic RNG seed.
2. Per_record features: top_channel, top_contrib_share, top2_share, num_nonzero_channels, spend_entropy, per_channel_percentiles, cluster_id, Age_bucket.
3. EdgeDetector: flag top2_share>0.95, entropy_low, extreme_percentile.
4. ChannelReliability lookup: cluster_posterior_mean, posterior_CI, posterior_logodds_lower/upper/mean, sample_count, FP_risk, rescue_allow.
5. Direction flags: dir_positive_cluster, dir_negative_cluster (require sample_count ≥ min_n).
6. Aggregator: compute aggregator_logit/SE; apply FP_risk-aware multiplier (per-channel asymmetry); compute counterfactual aggregator (no attenuation).
7. SRM_v3 predict (return score+SE).
8. GLM_v6 predict (include FP_risk & interactions).
9. Consensus & routing:
   - Identify single_spike band and channel rescue metadata; apply per-band, per-channel rules.
   - Compute DecisionRisk; if DecisionRisk > threshold or contradictions present → audit/abstain.
10. Calibration & uncertainty:
   - predicted_se via CoverageGuard; final se_logit_final includes FP_risk penalty; compute p_lower using z scaling; apply p_final shrink factor for FP_risk.
11. Decision persistence: final decision, reason_code, full per-prediction provenance (aggregator logits, counterfactual, channel×cluster posterior ids, FP_risk, GLM/SRM outputs + SEs, DecisionRisk, edge flags).
12. Post-batch checks & alerts.

DEFAULT PARAMETERS (v3.3.2 initial)

- per_channel calibration min_n = 150; per_cluster calibration min_n = 100

VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS & METRICS
- Holdouts: stratify by cluster, top_channel, Age_bucket; targeted holdouts: 0066_01, 0067_02/03, 0069_01, 0070_01, 0071_01.
- Metrics: per_channel_per_cluster FN/FP, Brier, ECE, CI coverage, audit fraction, abstain fraction, rescue_auto_accept fraction, per-age bucket error rates.
- Sweeps:
  - τ ∈ {20,50,100}
  - cluster_min_n ∈ {20,30,50}
  - medium lower bound ∈ {0.65,0.70,0.75}
  - FP_risk gate ∈ {0.05,0.10,0.15,0.25}
  - DecisionRisk thresholds ∈ {0.30,0.35,0.40}
- Ablation: compare v3.2 vs v3.3 vs v3.3.2 to target:
  - Reduce medium-single_spike FPs (especially FoodCourt/VRDeck) by ≥50% vs v3.3.
  - Retain ≥60% of extreme RoomService rescues (reduce FNs like 0069_01 by ≥50% vs v3.0).
  - Keep overall FP increase for RoomService ≤20% and overall abstain/audit fraction within operational limits.

IMMEDIATE OPERATIONAL ACTIONS (24–72 hours)
1. Compute and persist FP_risk(channel, cluster, spend_bucket) historical table and expose it to scorer (Data Engineering).
2. Implement channel rescue metadata: create rescue_allow defaults (RoomService:true; FoodCourt/VRDeck:false) and expose to scorer (Scoring Engineers).
3. Add top2_share, spend_entropy, top_channel_percentile to preprocessor; compute DecisionRisk per prediction (Scoring Engineers).
4. Tighten medium & extreme single_spike acceptance in scorer to use FP_risk gating and route ambiguous/high DecisionRisk to audit or abstain (Scoring + ML).
5. Retrain GLM_fallback v6 with negative oversampling for FoodCourt & VRDeck; deploy in shadow (Model Team).
6. Add precommit check: per-channel medium_single_spike_pred_True fraction_by_channel ≤ baseline + 10%; fail build if exceeded (SRE/CI).

EXPECTED TRADEOFFS & MITIGATIONS
- Tighter rules → fewer FPs but potentially more audits/abstains and some FNs.
  - Mitigate by targeted retraining (oversample negatives for trouble channels), per-channel rescue whitelist (recover RoomService), and short retrain cadence for hot channels.
- Audit volume will increase initially; prioritize DecisionRisk > 0.5 and high FP_risk cases for human review.

HOW v3.3.2 WOULD HANDLE 0071_01 (concrete flow)
1. Identify extreme_single_spike (top_contrib_share ≈ 0.9695).
2. Lookup ChannelReliabilitySigned for (FoodCourt, cluster derived from Age=17, CryoSleep=False, Cabin_deck=F). Likely FP_risk_kC > 0.10 (moderate) based on recent FPs in young cohorts.
3. Check rescue_allow(FoodCourt) => false by default.
4. Apply extreme rules: rescue not permitted; require aggregator_p_lower ≥ 0.85 AND GLM_p ≥ 0.70 AND SRM ≥ 0.90. Not satisfied (GLM/SRM likely lower) → compute DecisionRisk.
5. DecisionRisk > 0.35 due to high spend_extremeness and moderate FP_risk → route to priority audit (or abstain if audit not available).
Result: avoid auto-accept for 0071_01, preventing the FP.

DELIVERABLES I WILL PRODUCE NEXT (deterministic, versioned)
- Deterministic scorer skeleton (Python pseudocode) implementing v3.3.2 rules (ChannelReliabilitySigned v2 + FP_risk, single_spike banding, DecisionRisk router) with unit tests and deterministic seeds.
- Shadow GLM_fallback v6 retrain with negative oversampling for FoodCourt & VRDeck and stratified validation.
- LOO validation report comparing v3.2, v3.3, v3.3.2 with recommended operating points and parameter sweep results.
- Audit log schema, precommit rule definitions, and dashboard KPI spec.
- Prioritised 72‑hour implementation checklist (owners, artifacts).

ONE-LINE SUMMARY
v3.3.2 adds explicit per (channel,cluster) FP_risk and channel-aware extreme-rescue gating, tightens single_spike consensus rules, incorporates spend-shape and age×channel interactions, retrains GLM/SRM with targeted negatives, and routes ambiguous/high-risk cases to prioritized audit — preventing FPs like 0071_01 while preserving true positive rescues such as 0069_01.

Would you like me to:
- produce the deterministic scorer skeleton (Python pseudocode + unit tests) now, or
- run the stratified LOO validation (v3.3 vs v3.3.2) and return the validation report with recommended operating points?

I can also generate a prioritized 72‑hour implementation checklist with suggested owners and required artifacts if that’s helpful.
