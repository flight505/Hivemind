PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 127
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)
- What happened (short): A brittle single‑record slice (n==1) produced a false negative on an all-zero + CryoSleep record:
  - Passenger 0167_01 — all spend channels = 0, CryoSleep = True → model predicted Not‑transported (false negative); actual = Transported.
  - This is the classic “all_zero + CryoSleep” low‑context failure: the scorer/calibrator were overconfident on an n==1 sample with very little corroborating signal and pooled priors / uncertainty modeling were insufficiently stratified for this slice.
- Immediate root causes (short):
  - permissive n==1 auto‑decision logic (single‑record batches allowed auto‑decide),
  - cryo_all_zero slices not treated as fragile when they should be (pooled priors/variance not stratified),
  - calibrator under‑estimates uncertainty for low‑context / high‑missingness records,
  - inconsistent provenance/imputation handling (zeros vs imputed missingness) between scorer ↔ calibrator ↔ gate,
  - per‑feature logits (CryoSleep, Cabin encodings) could dominate without caps or sign‑consistency checks,
  - no batch‑level hold for batches dominated by fragile records.
- Immediate stopgap (0–6h): Block any n==1 auto‑decision with fragile_flag that includes cryo_all_zero_flag (all channel spends == 0 AND CryoSleep == True) and missingness_count ≥ 1. Add 0167_01 to the canary list. Persist raw spends, imputation provenance and per‑feature contributions to ensure calibrator/gate use identical inputs.

Concise answers to the six questions (batch accuracy focus)
1) What specific patterns caused this error?
- Low‑context all‑zero + CryoSleep: there is almost no spend signal to corroborate other features, so pooled priors and single‑feature contributions (CryoSleep/Cabin/etc.) dominated. For n==1 the model was overconfident in the learned direction for CryoSleep/all_zero, but historical sign/direction for this slice is unstable across channels/demos; calibrator produced too narrow an interval and gate allowed auto‑accept.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent recurrence?
- For n==1 and cryo_all_zero (or other fragile flags): require GLM_fallback + ensemble agreement + se_combined and narrow quantile width (p90−p10) AND historical sign consistency, otherwise route to priority_audit. Escalate immediately if cryo_all_zero and no strong pooled‑prior backing (N_slice small) — do not auto‑accept.

3) What new insights about transport patterns?
- All‑zero + CryoSleep is a heterogeneous slice: in some demographics it correlates with Transported; in others it correlates with Not‑Transported (or data capture issues). CryoSleep’s predictive direction is context dependent and must be modeled as a modifier (CryoSleep × homeplanet × cabin × spend_entropy), not as a simple strong global feature.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated?
- Calibrator must output p10/p50/p90 and sd and inflate uncertainty for cryo_all_zero and other fragiles. Use slice‑aware SE floors and add var_components specific to cryo_all_zero, missingness, and sign‑inconsistency. Gate on se_combined and quantile width for auto‑decisions.

5) What adjustments are needed for batch consistency?
- Persist transforms/provenance across scoring/calibration/gating, stratify pooled priors by CryoSleep × all_zero × top1_channel × demo buckets, cap per‑feature logits, and add batch‑level check that holds auto‑decisions where batch_frac_fragile exceeds a threshold.

6) How can metrics be improved to handle edge cases?
- Add cryo_all_zero pooled priors, cryo‑aware variance terms, upweight such examples during retraining, add canaries and CI tests for all_zero+CryoSleep, and run a shadow‑run with no auto‑accept for canaries until performance stabilizes.

Complete updated predictive metrics report — actionable components (optimized for batch accuracy)

A. Feature engineering updates (v→v+1)
- Base & spend aggregates (unchanged):
  - sum_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck; sum_spend_log = log1p(sum_spend).
  - sum_spend_bucket = [0,50,200,400,600,800,2000+].
- All‑zero & Cryo flags (new / hardened):
  - all_zero_flag = (RoomService == 0 AND FoodCourt == 0 AND ShoppingMall == 0 AND Spa == 0 AND VRDeck == 0).
  - cryo_all_zero_flag = (CryoSleep == True AND all_zero_flag == True).
  - imputed_zero_flag = marker if any zero value replaces a missing value (requires imputation provenance).
  - missingness_count, missingness_profile (which channels missing vs true zero).
- Dominance & novelty:
  - top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share (as before).
  - top1_dom_flag = top1_share ≥ TOP1_DOM_THRESHOLD (0.60).
  - spend_entropy_norm, num_nonzero_channels.
  - feature_dom_fraction computed from per‑feature logit contributions.
  - dominance_sign_consistency_score: historical fraction with same sign for key features (CryoSleep, top1_channel) by bucket.
  - all_zero_context_score: Mahalanobis/kNN distance of this all_zero record to historical centroids of transported vs not transported all_zero records (gives quick contextual prior).
- Interactions:
  - CryoSleep × all_zero_flag × HomePlanet, CryoSleep × Cabin_section, CryoSleep × Age_bucket, all_zero_context_score × top1_channel.

B. Pooled priors (cryo‑aware + channel/demographic stratified)
- Stratify priors by (CryoSleep, all_zero_flag, top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, HomePlanet, Destination) wherever sample size supports it.
- Blend with slice weight τ_slice = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice).
- Use larger N0 for fragile slices:
  - N0_cryo_all_zero start = 150; N0_dom_channel baseline = 75; increase for high variance channels (FoodCourt) to 100–150.
- Version and snapshot pooled priors for provenance.

C. Per‑feature logit caps & sign‑consistency downweighting
- Enforce per‑feature caps to prevent a single feature (including CryoSleep) from overwhelming the logit:
  - CAP_PER_FEATURE_LOGIT = 3.0 logits (start; consider lowering to 2.0 for CryoSleep if needed after validation).
  - Per‑feature cap by feature type (spend features, binary features, embeddings).
- If dominance_sign_consistency_score < SIGN_CONSIST_MIN (0.70), downweight that feature’s contribution: scale = max(0.4, consistency_score) or multiplicative factor (sweep).
- For imputed_zero_flag True: downweight spend‑feature confidence (imputation uncertainty).

D. Variance / SE model (add cryo & all_zero terms)
- New variance components:
  - var_cryo_all_zero = κ_cryo_zero * indicator(cryo_all_zero_flag) * novelty_scale.
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count.
  - var_sign_inconsistency = κ_sign * (1 − dominance_sign_consistency_score).
  - var_dom_channel = κ_dom_c[c] * top1_share * novelty_scale.
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_cryo_all_zero + var_missingness + var_sign_inconsistency + var_dom_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, se_floor(context)^2))
- Start κs (sweepable):
  - κ_cryo_zero = 0.16; κ_dom baseline = 0.10; κ_dom_foodcourt = 0.14; κ_miss = 0.06; κ_sign = 0.08; κ_dispersion = 0.02.
- SE floors:
  - cryo_all_zero (n==1): se_floor ≥ 0.25–0.40 until N_slice ≥ N_min_cryo.
  - fragile slices generally: se_floor = 0.20–0.30; stable slices: 0.06–0.10.

E. Decision‑gating (pattern‑aware)
- Fragile_flag (v5):
  - cryo_all_zero_flag OR top1_dom_flag OR top1_spend_high OR all_zero_flag OR imputed_zero_flag OR missingness_count ≥ 2 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR dominance_sign_consistency_score < 0.7.
- Gating pseudocode (plain, ready to plug in):
  - if n_batch == 1 and fragile_flag:
      if cryo_all_zero_flag:
         route -> priority_audit unless (pooled_prior_confidence high AND N_slice_cryo_all_zero ≥ N_min_cryo AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept_cryo AND (p90−p10) ≤ QW_accept_cryo)
      else if top1_share ≥ 0.90:
         route -> priority_audit
      else:
         allow_auto = (slice_context_score ≥ Z_high) AND (N_slice_for_context ≥ N_min_slice_for_slice_type) AND (GLM_fallback_agrees) AND (ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high) AND (se_combined ≤ SE_accept_for_slice_type) AND ((p90 − p10) ≤ QW_accept_for_slice_type) AND (dominance_sign_consistency_score ≥ SIGN_CONSIST_MIN)
         if not allow_auto:
             route -> priority_audit
- Threshold examples for cryo_all_zero:
  - N_min_cryo = 50; Z_high = 0.90 for pooled_prior_confidence; SE_accept_cryo = 0.06 only if N_slice_cryo_all_zero ≥ 50 and pooled_prior_tau ≥ 0.85; otherwise route.

F. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan (cryo & all_zero focused)
- Calibrator:
  - Output p10/p50/p90 and sd using conformalized quantile regression or quantile pinball + heteroskedastic variance head.
  - Inputs include raw_logit, CryoSleep, all_zero_flag, imputed_zero_flag, top1_channel, top1_share, feature_dom_fraction, dominance_sign_consistency_score, missingness_count, spend_entropy_norm, context dims.
  - Loss: quantile pinball + ECE penalty + Brier; upweight cryo_all_zero, dom_high and sign_inconsistency records by ×5–10.
- GLM_fallback:
  - Interpretable regularized logistic with enforced per‑feature logit caps and explicit interactions (CryoSleep×HomePlanet, CryoSleep×all_zero, top1_channel×top1_share).
  - GLM_fallback_agrees = |p_model − p_glm| ≤ δ (δ sweep 0.05–0.10 depending on slice).
- Training & validation:
  - Rolling window: last 18–36 months; stratify CV to ensure small slices (cryo_all_zero, dom_high) present in all folds.
  - Upweight canaries and contradictory examples.
  - Shadow‑run: 14–28 days with gating active (no auto‑accepts on canaries).
- Acceptance criteria:
  - cryo_all_zero FN rate ↓ ≥ 40–60% (relative) in shadow run,
  - dom_high contradictions ↓ ≥ 40–60%,
  - no canary auto‑accepts,
  - Global ECE not worsened by >0.5% absolute.

G. Monitoring, metrics & alerts (batch‑focused)
- Dashboards per‑slice & global: ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate, batch_frac_fragile, canary_auto_accepts, cryo_all_zero_false_negative_rate, dominance_sign_consistency_by_channel.
- New batch KPIs: Batch_auto_decision_rate, Batch_frac_fragile, Batch_provenance_consistency_rate, Top1_dom_false_neg_rate_by_channel, CryoAllZero_FN_rate.
- Alerts:
  - any canary auto‑accepted → immediate hold + page ML/Ops
  - cryo_all_zero FN rate > baseline + X% in 24h → hold auto‑accepts + page
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD (5%) → hold batch auto‑decisions & notify
  - any top1_share ≥ 0.90 auto‑accepted → immediate page
- Canary list (initial): 0167_01 (all_zero_cryo), 0164_01 (FoodCourt dom), 0160_01 (RoomService outlier), 0163_01 (all_zero + CryoSleep legacy), 0152_01, 0151_01, 0144_01, 0148_01, 0149_01.

H. CI unit tests & validation (cover cryo_all_zero & dom_high)
- Tests:
  - cryo_all_zero computed identically across scorer/calibrator/gate (identical provenance).
  - se_combined increases when cryo_all_zero True and/or dominance_sign_consistency_score < 0.7.
  - calibrator widens p10/p90 for cryo_all_zero and sign_inconsistency records.
  - pooled‑prior blending uses per‑slice N0 (N0_cryo_all_zero respected).
  - per‑feature logit cap enforced and tested across extremes (ensure caps applied for CryoSleep logit).
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold disables auto‑decisions for entire batch.
  - Canaries: 0167_01 and prior canaries must not be auto‑accepted in unit test harness with gating active.
- Shadow‑run acceptance:
  - cryo_all_zero FN reduction target met,
  - no canary auto‑accepts.

I. Operational actions (0–72 hours) — precise timeline
1) Immediate (0–6h)
   - Deploy n==1 gating patch: block auto‑decisions for records with cryo_all_zero_flag OR (top1_share ≥ 0.60) OR top1_spend ≥ 400 OR all_zero_flag OR missingness_count ≥ 2 OR imputed_zero_flag. Add 0167_01 to canary list and block it.
   - Persist provenance fields: raw spends, imputation flags, CryoSleep, per‑feature contributions, pooled_prior_snapshot_id.
   - Escalate: any cryo_all_zero auto‑accept (if observed) → priority_audit page.
2) Short‑term (6–24h)
   - Expose var_cryo_all_zero, var_missingness, var_feature_dom, var_dispersion, se_combined in scoring output.
   - Implement temporary per‑feature logit caps (3.0 logits) including on CryoSleep; implement dominant scaling and sign‑consistency downweight.
   - Implement batch‑level check to pause auto‑decisions if batch_frac_fragile ≥ 5%.
   - Instrument dashboards for cryo_all_zero_FN_rate and dominance_sign_consistency_by_channel and set alerts.
3) Mid‑term (24–72h)
   - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with cryo/all_zero inputs, upweight contradictions; run 14–28 day shadow‑run.
   - Publish pooled‑prior snapshots (μ_cryo_all_zero_demo, μ_dom_channel_demo).
   - Launch dashboards & alerts for targeted slices and canaries.
   - Seed active‑label queue with cryo_all_zero contradictions for rapid labelling.

J. Per‑record provenance to log (required & extended)
- Raw channels: RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck
- sum_spend (raw & log1p), sum_spend_bucket
- top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share, top2_channel, top2_spend
- all_zero_flag, cryo_all_zero_flag, imputed_zero_flag, concentration_by_channel_flag
- spend_entropy_norm, num_nonzero_channels, missingness_count, missingness_profile
- feature_dom_fraction, per_feature_logit_contributions (map), dominance_sign_consistency_score, novelty_score, all_zero_context_score
- pooled_prior_snapshot_id, μ_slice, τ_slice_blend
- var_cryo_all_zero, var_missingness, var_feature_dom, var_dispersion, var_sign_inconsistency, se_combined
- GLM_fallback_probs, GLM_fallback_agreement_flag
- ensemble_probs, ensemble_agreement
- p10/p50/p90, p_final_sd, quantile_width
- gating_reasons, routing_decision (auto/priority_audit)
- scorer_version, calibrator_version, provenance_hash

K. Initial hyperparameters (start values; sweepable)
- cryo_all_zero N0: N0_cryo_all_zero = 150
- TOP1_DOM_THRESHOLD = 0.60
- TOP1_SPEND_HIGH = 400
- BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD = 0.05 (5%)
- N_min_cryo = 50; N_min_slice = 50 (dom_high), 25 (other fragiles)
- Z_high (pooled prior confidence) = 0.90 (cryo_all_zero), 0.85 (dom_high)
- A_high (ensemble agreement) = 0.995
- SE_accept_general = 0.06; SE_accept_cryo only if N_slice_cryo ≥ N_min_cryo and pooled_prior τ ≥ 0.85
- QW_accept_cryo (p90−p10) = 0.12
- CAP_PER_FEATURE_LOGIT = 3.0 (consider 2.0–2.5 for CryoSleep)
- κ_cryo_zero = 0.16; κ_dom baseline = 0.10; κ_dom_foodcourt = 0.14; κ_miss = 0.06; κ_sign = 0.08

L. CI canaries & expected behavior
- 0167_01 (all spends = 0, CryoSleep = True):
  - Expected: route -> priority_audit (immediate escalation) unless there is substantial supporting evidence (N_slice_cryo_all_zero ≥ N_min_cryo AND pooled_prior_confidence ≥ 0.90 AND GLM & ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ 0.06).
- 0164_01, 0160_01, 0163_01, etc. retained as canaries with similar hard gating.
- Unit tests must assert that these canaries are not auto‑accepted under stopgap rules.

Why this will reduce batch errors (short)
- Fragile gating prevents overconfident auto‑decisions on n==1 low‑context slices (cryo_all_zero, dom_high).
- Cryo/all_zero‑aware pooled priors and larger N0 prevent single records from overturning priors inappropriately.
- var_cryo_all_zero and sign‑inconsistency terms inflate calibrated uncertainty for brittle slices; gate requires consensus before auto‑deciding.
- Per‑feature logit caps and sign‑consistency downweighting stop single features (CryoSleep or a spend) from flipping predictions when historically unstable.
- Standardized transforms + persisted provenance remove mismatch bugs across scorer/calibrator/gate.
- Retraining with upweighted contradictions corrects directionality and reduces similar brittle future errors.

Immediate one‑line corrective action
- Deploy n==1 gating: route any record with cryo_all_zero_flag OR top1_share ≥ 0.60 OR top1_spend ≥ 400 OR all_zero_flag OR imputed_zero_flag OR missingness_count ≥ 2 to priority_audit (immediately escalate cryo_all_zero and top1_share ≥ 0.90); add 0167_01 to the canary list.

Concrete gating pseudocode (ready to paste into pipeline)
- Input: record r, n_batch, provenance fields (CryoSleep, all_zero_flag, cryo_all_zero_flag, top1_share, top1_spend, feature_dom_fraction, dominance_sign_consistency_score, missingness_count, imputed_zero_flag, pooled_prior_tau, N_slice_cryo)
- fragile_flag = (cryo_all_zero_flag) OR (top1_share >= 0.60) OR (top1_spend >= 400) OR (all_zero_flag) OR (imputed_zero_flag) OR (missingness_count >= 2) OR (feature_dom_fraction >= 0.60) OR (dominance_sign_consistency_score < 0.7)
- if n_batch == 1 and fragile_flag:
    if cryo_all_zero_flag:
        if (pooled_prior_tau >= 0.90) and (N_slice_cryo >= N_min_cryo) and (GLM_fallback_agrees) and (ensemble_agreement >= A_high) and (se_combined <= SE_accept_cryo) and ((p90 - p10) <= QW_accept_cryo):
            allow_auto = True
        else:
            route -> priority_audit
    else if top1_share >= 0.90:
        route -> priority_audit
    else:
        allow_auto = (slice_context_score >= Z_high) and (N_slice_for_context >= N_min_slice_for_slice_type) and (GLM_fallback_agrees) and (ensemble_agreement >= A_high) and (se_combined <= SE_accept_for_slice_type) and ((p90 - p10) <= QW_accept_for_slice_type) and (dominance_sign_consistency_score >= SIGN_CONSIST_MIN)
        if not allow_auto:
            route -> priority_audit

Next steps / offer
- I recommend immediate rollout of the stopgap gating patch (option 1) and simultaneously preparing the full retrain + shadow‑run (option 2).
  1) Minimal gating patch (0–6h): exact pseudocode, unit tests (including canary 0167_01), and deploy checklist — ready in 2–6 hours.
  2) Full retrain & deployment plan (24–48h): dataset selection, upweight schedule for contradictions, CV folds preserving small slices, hyperparameter sweep plan, shadow‑run dashboard definitions.
- Which do you want me to produce first? If you want the immediate patch now I will output exact code‑style pseudocode, a small set of unit tests (canary harness), and a deploy checklist. If you want the full retrain plan I’ll produce the training recipe, CV splits, upweight schedule for contradictions, and shadow‑run acceptance criteria.

If you want, I will now generate the immediate gating patch (pseudocode + unit tests) and a short deploy checklist that you can apply to stop further brittle auto‑decisions this hour.
