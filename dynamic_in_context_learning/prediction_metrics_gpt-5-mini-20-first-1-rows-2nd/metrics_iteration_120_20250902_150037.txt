PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 120
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)
- What happened (short): A brittle single-record failure surfaced: 0152_01 (Andan Estron) — dominant single-channel spend (VRDeck = 607) while other spend channels = 0, CryoSleep = False. Model predicted Transported (FP) but actual = Not-transported. This joins prior brittle modes (all_zero + CryoSleep) and demonstrates a second fragile slice: high single-channel concentration / "feature_dom" (sometimes FN, sometimes FP).
- Immediate root causes (short): permissive n==1 auto-decision + pooled priors not stratified by dominant-channel interactions + calibrator under-estimating uncertainty for high-concentration novelty + per-feature contributions unbounded (one channel flipped sign) + provenance/transform mismatches across scorer↔calibrator↔gate + insufficient batch-level gating for concentration-based fragiles.
- Immediate stopgap (0–6h): DO NOT auto-accept/auto-decline any n==1 record that meets fragile_flag (including top1_share_high OR cryo_all_zero_flag). Route to priority_audit unless ALL gating checks pass (slice_context_score ≥ 0.85, N_slice ≥ 50 for this fragile class, GLM_fallback agrees, ensemble_agreement ≥ 0.995, se_combined ≤ SE_accept_for_slice). Add 0152_01 (Andan Estron) and prior canaries to canary list and block auto-decisions on them.

CONCISE ANSWERS TO THE SIX QUESTIONS (focused on 0152_01 plus batch accuracy)

1) What specific patterns caused this error?
- Pattern: dominant single-channel spend (VRDeck high, other channels zero) → feature_dom. The scorer's raw logit was dominated by VRDeck contribution; calibrator under-estimated uncertainty for this novel concentration context and allowed a high-confidence prediction for n==1. Pooled priors did not pull this single record back to a conservative prior because priors were not stratified by dominant-channel interactions and had low N for this slice.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent recurrence?
- Treat high-concentration single-records as fragile (top1_share ≥ 0.60 or top1_spend ≥ 400). For n==1 & fragile_flag: require stronger gating — higher N_slice (≥50), slice_context_score ≥0.85, GLM_fallback agreement, ensemble_agreement ≥0.995, se_combined ≤ 0.06–0.10 depending on slice; otherwise route to priority_audit. Batch-level: if batch_frac_fragile ≥ 5–10% then pause auto-decisions for entire batch.

3) What new insights about passenger transport patterns?
- High spend in a single channel (especially VRDeck or Spa) is not uniformly predictive of Transported — it is context dependent (HomePlanet, Age, Cabin, Destination) and prone to label contradictions. These "feature_dom" records frequently have low historical N and label noise; they should be treated as weak-context and high-novelty.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated?
- Calibrator must output p10/p50/p90 and sd; add explicit var_dom_high/top1_var term to inflate uncertainty when a single feature dominates. Use dynamic SE floors: 0.25–0.35 for weak-context fragiles (including cryo_all_zero and dom_high), 0.06–0.10 for strong-context slices. Gate auto-decisions on se_combined and p90−p10 (quantile width), not only point probability.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Standardize transforms and persist provenance (so scorer/calibrator/gate use identical inputs). Stratify pooled priors by dominant-channel bucket and CryoSleep interactions. Introduce batch-level checks that pause auto-decisions when fragile fraction is large. Add per-feature logit caps and bounded logit offsets to prevent single features from overwhelming the logit.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Add dominant-channel-specific pooled priors (μ_dom_channel_demo) with larger N0, new variance term var_dom_high that inflates se for single-channel concentration, upweight contradictions for these slices during retraining, and add canaries and monitoring for dom_high_by_ctx slices.

COMPLETE UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT — actionable components (optimized for batch prediction accuracy)

A. Feature engineering updates (v→v+1)
- Base aggregates:
  - sum_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck (raw & log1p).
  - sum_spend_bucket = [0, 50, 200, 400, 600, 800, 2000+].
- Flags & ranks:
  - all_zero_flag = (sum_spend == 0 AND num_nonzero_channels == 0).
  - cryo_all_zero_flag = (all_zero_flag AND CryoSleep == True).
  - top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share; top2_channel, top2_spend, top2_share.
  - top1_share_bucket = [0-0.3, 0.3-0.5, 0.5-0.7, 0.7+].
  - top1_dom_flag = (top1_share ≥ TOP1_DOM_THRESHOLD) — initial threshold 0.60.
  - concentration_by_channel_flag = top1_dom_flag.
  - missingness_count = count NULLs (Destination, Cabin, HomePlanet).
  - spend_entropy_norm = normalized Shannon entropy across channels.
  - feature_dom_fraction = fraction of final logit contributed by top1 feature (tracked at provenance).
  - novelty_score = distance to nearest historical centroid for slice (includes CryoSleep, Age_bucket, HomePlanet, Destination).
- Interaction features (new):
  - CryoSleep × all_zero_flag
  - top1_channel × top1_share_bucket
  - top1_channel × sum_spend_bucket
  - top1_share × sum_spend (to capture large absolute + concentration)
  - top1_channel × Age_bucket, top1_channel × HomePlanet

B. Pooled priors (channel-aware + dom-aware + cryo_all_zero-aware)
- Stratify μ to compute:
  - μ_dom_channel_demo = P(transported | top1_channel = c AND top1_share_bucket = b, context).
  - μ_all_zero_cryo_demo and μ_all_zero_demo as before.
  - μ_sumspend_demo, μ_conc_channel_demo, μ_dual_channel_demo as before.
- Blending:
  - τ_slice = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice).
  - Use larger N0 for fragile slices:
    - N0_all_zero_cryo = 100
    - N0_dom_channel = 75 (initial; sweep 50–200)
    - N0_all_zero = 50
    - N0_dual/dom fragiles = 50

C. Direction-aware bounded logit offsets & per-feature caps
- Add bounded additive logit offsets per context:
  - offset = clamp(base_shift + w_ctx*(context_score − 0.5)*2, −0.5, 0.5) * τ_slice
- Per-feature logit caps:
  - CAP_PER_FEATURE_LOGIT = 3.0 logits (default). No single feature contribution > cap.
- Bounded total-feature dominance:
  - If feature_dom_fraction > 0.6, scale down top1 contribution by factor f = max(0.5, 1 − (feature_dom_fraction − 0.6)) to reduce single-feature dominance.

D. Variance / SE model (explicit; add dom term)
- New variance components (sweepable κ):
  - var_dom_high = κ_dom * (top1_share) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale.
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale.
  - var_all_zero_cryo = κ_zero_cryo * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * 2.0 * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale.
  - var_conc_by_channel, var_dual_high, var_missingness, var_spend_scale, var_feature_dom as in prior plan.
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_dom_high*(top1_dom_flag) + var_all_zero + var_all_zero_cryo*(cryo_all_zero_flag) + other components.
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Example κ defaults (start; validate by sweep):
  - κ_dom = 0.10; κ_zero = 0.08; κ_zero_cryo = 0.12; κ_conc_chan = 0.06; κ_dual = 0.06; κ_dom_other = 0.08; κ_miss = 0.05; κ_feature_dom = 0.07; κ_scale = 0.02
- Dynamic SE floors:
  - fragiles (cryo_all_zero, dom_high, dual_high): se_floor = 0.25–0.35
  - strong-context: se_floor = 0.06–0.10
  - For n==1 and top1_dom_flag: enforce higher se_floor (0.20–0.30) until N_slice ≥ N_min

E. Decision-gating (pattern-aware, concrete)
- Fragile_flag (v3): all_zero_flag OR cryo_all_zero_flag OR top1_dom_flag (top1_share ≥ 0.60) OR top1_spend ≥ 400 OR top2_balanced_high OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2.
- Gating pseudocode:
  - if n == 1 and fragile_flag:
      allow_auto_decision = (
        slice_context_score >= Z_high AND
        N_slice >= N_min_slice_for_slice_type AND
        GLM_fallback_agrees AND
        ensemble_agreement >= A_high AND
        se_combined <= SE_accept_for_slice_type AND
        quantile_width (p90−p10) <= QW_accept_for_slice_type
      )
      if not allow_auto_decision:
         route -> priority_audit
- Special-for-dom_high:
  - N_min_slice = 50; Z_high = 0.85; A_high = 0.995; SE_accept ≤ 0.06; QW_accept ≤ 0.12; require GLM_fallback_agrees
- Batch-level rule:
  - if batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD (e.g., 5–10%) then pause auto-decisions for entire batch and require staged processing / human review
- Initial constants (sweepable):
  - TOP1_DOM_THRESHOLD = 0.60
  - TOP1_SPEND_HIGH = 400 (USD-equivalent bucket)
  - SUMSPEND_MINOR = 500
  - ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800
  - FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
  - Z_high = 0.85 (dom_high/cryo_all_zero), 0.80 (other fragiles)
  - N_min_slice = 50 (dom_high & cryo_all_zero), 25 (other fragiles)
  - A_high = 0.995
  - SE_accept = 0.06 general; 0.08–0.12 for n≤3; for dom_high/cryo_all_zero require stronger consensus (0.05–0.06)
  - QW_accept (p90−p10) = 0.12 (dom_high/cryo_all_zero) – 0.18 (others)
  - BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD = 0.05 (5%)

F. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan (include dominant-channel interactions)
- Calibrator:
  - Outputs: p10, p50, p90, sd (quantile regression + aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty).
  - Inputs: raw_logit, top1_channel, top1_share, top1_dom_flag, cryo_all_zero_flag, all_zero_flag, ensemble_agreement, concentration_flag, dom_channel_context_score, top2_share, sum_spend_bucket, spend_entropy_norm, feature_dom_fraction, missingness_count, context scores, Age_bucket, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin.
  - Add interactions: top1_channel × top1_share, top1_channel × CryoSleep, CryoSleep × all_zero.
  - Loss: combined quantile (pinball) + ECE penalty + Brier weight; upweight dom_high & cryo_all_zero contradictions ×5 (initial) and other fragiles ×3.
  - Training window: last 18–36 months; hold out last 14–28 days for shadow-run; maintain stratified CV to preserve small-slice representation.
- GLM_fallback:
  - Include interactions top1_channel×top1_share, top1_channel×sum_spend, top1_share×sum_spend, CryoSleep×top1_channel.
  - Regularization: elastic-net; restrict coefficients so per-feature logit contributions ≤ CAP_PER_FEATURE_LOGIT.
  - Upweight contradictions ×3–5.
- Shadow-run: ≥14 days; calibrator & GLM must output quantiles and gating_decision_suggestion.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - dom_high contradictions reduced ≥40–60%.
  - cryo_all_zero contradictions reduced ≥40–60%.
  - No canary auto-accepts in shadow period.
  - Global per-slice ECE not worsened by >0.5–1.0% absolute.

G. Monitoring, metrics & alerts (batch-focused)
- Dashboards (per-slice & global): ECE, Brier, FP rate, FN rate, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate, batch_frac_fragile, canary_auto_accepts for slices: dom_high_by_ctx, cryo_all_zero_by_ctx, all_zero_by_ctx, dual_high_by_ctx.
- New batch KPIs:
  - Batch auto-decision rate
  - Batch_frac_fragile
  - Batch_provenance_consistency_rate (percentage of records where scorer/calibrator/gate provenance identical)
- Alerts:
  - slice FP or FN >20% deviance from baseline in 24h → hold auto-accepts + page ML/Ops
  - any canary auto-accepted → immediate hold + page
  - jump in n==1_auto_accept_rate (>5% absolute in 24h) → notify
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ 5% → hold batch auto-decisions
- Canaries: add 0152_01 (Andan Estron), 0151_01, 0144_01, 0148_01, 0149_01. Block auto-decisions on them.

H. CI unit tests & validation (must include dom_high & cryo_all_zero)
- Tests:
  - top1_dom_flag triggers in scorer, calibrator, gate and proofs that values identical given same provenance
  - se_combined increases when top1_dom_flag True
  - calibrator widens quantile spreads for dom_high and cryo_all_zero
  - pooled-prior blending respects N0_dom_channel
  - per-feature logit cap enforcement
  - batch-level rule: if batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold, auto-decisions disabled for batch
  - canary test: canaries not auto-accepted in unit test harness
- Shadow-run acceptance:
  - dom_high contradictions reduced ≥40–60%
  - cryo_all_zero contradictions reduced ≥40–60%
  - no canary auto-accepted
  - global ECE within tolerated degradation (<0.5–1.0% absolute)

I. Operational actions (0–72 hours) — precise timeline
1) Immediate (0–6h)
   - Deploy n==1 gating patch that blocks auto-decisions for dom_high_flag and cryo_all_zero_flag and other fragiles (include canary IDs 0152_01, 0151_01 etc.). Route to priority_audit.
   - Persist provenance fields (top1/top2/flags/var_terms/CryoSleep) in scoring logs so gate/calibrator see identical values.
   - Add 0152_01 and prior canaries to canary list and block auto-decisions on them.
2) Short-term (6–24h)
   - Expose var_dom_high, var_all_zero_cryo, var_all_zero, var_dual_high, var_dom_high, var_spend_scale, var_feature_dom in provenance and compute se_combined in scoring.
   - Implement temporary per-feature logit caps (3.0 logits) in scoring to prevent single-feature flip.
   - Implement batch-level check to pause auto-decisions if batch_frac_fragile ≥ 5%.
   - Instrument dashboards for dom_high_by_ctx and cryo_all_zero_by_ctx slices and set initial alerts.
3) Mid-term (24–72h)
   - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with top1_channel×top1_share and CryoSleep interactions, upweight contradictions; start ≥14 day shadow-run.
   - Publish updated pooled-prior snapshots (including μ_dom_channel_demo and μ_all_zero_cryo).
   - Launch dashboards & alerts for targeted slices and canaries.
   - Seed active-label queue with dom_high and cryo_all_zero contradictions for rapid labeling.

- scorer_version, calibrator_version, provenance_hash

K. Initial hyperparameters (start values; sweepable)
- TOP1_DOM_THRESHOLD = 0.60
- TOP1_SPEND_HIGH = 400
- SUMSPEND_MINOR = 500
- ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800
- FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
- Z_high = 0.85 (dom_high/cryo_all_zero), 0.80 (other fragiles)
- N_min_slice = 50 (dom_high/cryo_all_zero), 25 (other fragiles)
- A_high = 0.995
- SE_accept = 0.06 general; 0.08–0.12 for small-n; dom_high/cryo_all_zero require stronger consensus (0.05–0.06)
- QW_accept = 0.12 (dom_high/cryo_all_zero) – 0.18 (others)
- κ_dom = 0.10; κ_zero = 0.08; κ_zero_cryo = 0.12; κ_conc_chan = 0.06; κ_dual = 0.06; κ_dom_other = 0.08; κ_miss = 0.05; κ_feature_dom = 0.07; κ_scale = 0.02
- N0_dom_channel = 75 (sweep 50–200)
- N0_all_zero_cryo = 100 (sweep 50–200)
- per-feature logit cap = 3.0 logits

L. CI canaries & expected behavior (update)
- 0152_01 (Andan Estron; VRDeck = 607, top1_dom_flag True):
  - Expected gating_reason: 'dom_high_stopgap' -> route to priority_audit unless dom_context_score ≥ Z_high AND GLM & ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept.
- 0151_01 (Shanie Simson; all_zero + CryoSleep True): same handling as cryo_all_zero_stopgap.
- 0149_01, 0144_01, 0148_01, etc.: maintain prior stopgap conditions.

WHY THIS WILL REDUCE BATCH ERRORS (short)
- Fragile gating prevents overconfident auto-decisions for single-record novel slices (dom_high, all_zero + CryoSleep).
- Dominant-channel-aware pooled priors and larger N0 for dom_high prevents a single record from overturning stable priors.
- var_dom_high and var_all_zero_cryo increase calibrated uncertainty for brittle slices; gates require consensus before auto-deciding.
- Per-feature logit caps and bounded offsets stop single features from flipping predictions.
- Standardized transforms + persisted provenance remove mismatch bugs between scorer/calibrator/gate.
- Retraining with upweighted contradictions corrects directionality errors over time.

IMMEDIATE ONE-LINE CORRECTIVE ACTION
- Implement n==1 gating: route any record with top1_share ≥ 0.60 OR top1_spend ≥ 400 OR cryo_all_zero_flag OR all_zero_flag OR top2_balanced_high OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2 to priority_audit unless context_score ≥ 0.85 AND GLM_fallback & ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ 0.06 — add 0152_01, 0151_01, 0144_01, 0148_01, 0149_01 to canaries.

NEXT STEPS / OFFER
I can deliver:
1) Minimal gating patch (pseudocode + CI unit tests + deploy checklist) to block fragile n==1 auto-decisions and add canaries within 2–12 hours (recommended immediate action); or
2) Full retrain & deployment plan (dataset selection, upweighting schedule, CV folds, hyperparameter sweeps, acceptance criteria, dashboards) for calibrator & GLM_fallback with a 14–28 day shadow-run plan within 24–48 hours.

Which would you like me to produce first?
