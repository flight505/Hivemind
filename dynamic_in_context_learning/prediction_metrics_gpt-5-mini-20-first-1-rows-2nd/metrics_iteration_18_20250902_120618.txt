PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 18
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate cause: 0035_01 is a classic mirror of the prior zero‑spend failure: the pipeline over‑relied on spending evidence and lacked robust spend‑dominance controls. Here very large spend values (RoomService=784, FoodCourt=964, Spa=951) produced large positive deltas that overrode weaker negative/neutral signals and an under‑estimated uncertainty, producing a confident False‑positive (predicted True, actual False).
- Top priorities (deploy in order):
  1. Implement spend‑dominance detection + "high‑spend outlier" guard that either down‑weights spend contributions or routes the case to a conservative fallback (segment prior / GLM / Abstain).
  2. Rebalance feature weights (reduce SpendingGroup emphasis; increase Age and segment priors) and add per‑channel max_delta clipping (stronger for spend channels).
  3. Increase uncertainty for correlated spend channels (use higher default correlation or empirical corr), recompute se_logit_final conservatively and raise p_lower thresholds for spend‑dominant predictions.
  4. Add per‑segment and per‑spend calibration (Platt + spend‑group adjustment) and tiered acceptance thresholds for spend‑dominant vs non‑dominant predictions.
  5. Strengthen monitoring (spend‑dominant FPR, per‑segment CI coverage) and snapshot bin boundaries; block batch commits if spend distribution shifts materially.

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- Spending dominance
  - Multiple high spend channels contributed large, positive deltas. The model treated those deltas as reliable positive evidence and allowed them to dominate the final logit.
- Insufficient outlier handling for spend
  - Winsorization/log1p alone did not eliminate very large influence; no per‑channel or total‑spend outlier guard was applied.
- Underestimated uncertainty for correlated spend channels
  - Spend channels are highly correlated (same passenger behavior), but the covariance used was too optimistic → se_logit_final too small → p_lower overly confident.
- Too‑low safeguards for spend‑driven votes
  - SpendingGroup dominance thresholds were either too permissive or not enforced. The pipeline allowed spend to decide the outcome without requiring corroborating evidence.
- Missing negative/contradictory checks
  - Rules did not sufficiently check for contradictions (e.g., high spend but segment prior low, CryoSleep flag and Age patterns inconsistent with high spend).
- Potential label/noise check missing
  - No quick verification for potential labeling errors or improbable spending patterns for that segment (should be routed to audit if suspicious).

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
- Detect spend dominance explicitly
  - Define top_contrib_share = |signed_contrib_top| / Σ|signed_contrib_i|. If top_contrib_source == SpendingGroup and top_contrib_share ≥ dominance_top_share_threshold (default 0.45) → mark as spend_dominant.
- High‑spend outlier guard
  - Compute TotalSpend_log1p and robust zscore against segment median and MAD (segment = Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination). If robust_z > z_outlier_threshold (default 3.0) → spend_outlier=True.
  - If spend_outlier: reduce SpendWeight by spend_outlier_factor (default 0.5) OR route to GLM fallback or trained segment prior evaluation; do not allow spend alone to decide.
- Strengthen spend‑dominant acceptance conditions
  - For spend_dominant predictions require either:
    a) p_lower ≥ p_lower_spend_strong (default 0.75), OR
    b) p_lower ≥ p_lower_spend_secondary (default 0.68) AND (n_effective_spend ≥ 8) AND (at least one non‑spend reliable contributor).
  - Otherwise Abstain or route to audit.
- Per‑channel delta clipping for spend features
  - max_delta_spend = ±0.6 (smaller than non‑spend max_delta ±0.8). This prevents any single spend channel from overwhelming the logit.
- Correlation-aware uncertainty inflation
  - Use empirical spend covariance where available; otherwise use conservative default Corr_spend = 0.8 (was 0.6). This increases se_logit_final for spend sums and reduces overconfidence.
- Contradiction guard
  - If segment_prior_shrunk < p_seg_low (e.g., 0.45) and spending is top positive contributor → require stricter p_lower or mark as conflicting → Abstain.
- All_spend_zero logic retained and generalized
  - Keep the all_spend_zero segment prior pathway (as in prior plan) but now also include the spend_outlier pathway. Both should be considered before spending‑dominant automatic acceptance.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- High spend ≠ guaranteed transported: extreme spenders can be either transported or not; spend alone is an unreliable single predictor without context.
- Spending is highly correlated across channels and can create pseudo‑certainty; correlation structure matters more than previously modeled.
- Interactions matter: Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination priors can contradict spending signals; these should be consulted first when spend is extreme (high or zero).
- Both tails (zero and extreme spend) are sensitive: predictive rules must treat both ends explicitly with symmetric but distinct logic.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Two‑stage calibration
  - (A) Global Platt scaling on raw logit_final → p_calibrated.
  - (B) Per‑segment (Age bucket × SpendingGroup) calibration adjustments: compute local ECE and apply per‑segment offsets/threshold adjustments.
- Tiered acceptance thresholds (suggested starting points)
  - High confidence: p_lower ≥ 0.75, support_abs_total ≥ 0.08, reliable_nonspend_count ≥ 1.
  - Medium confidence: p_lower ∈ [0.60,0.75) and support_abs_total ≥ 0.05 and non‑spend corroboration present.
  - Low / Abstain: p_lower < 0.60 or support_abs_total < 0.05 or spending_dominant without corroboration.
- Spend‑dominant adjustment
  - For spend_dominant: raise high/medium thresholds by +0.05 (i.e., high = 0.80, medium lower bound = 0.65) unless non‑spend corroboration exists.
- CI z adjustments
  - Use z = 1.28 (90%) normally; for spend_dominant or spend_outlier cases use z = 1.64 (95%) to enforce more conservative p_lower.
- Track per‑segment CI coverage and adjust Platt mapping if spend groups show systematic miscalibration.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Persist deterministic snapshots
  - Save snapshot_id with bin boundaries, pooled merges, per‑bin counts, Corr_ij. Use same snapshot across a batch.
- Deterministic pooling & merge logs
  - Record pooling hierarchy and pooled_bin_source for every prediction.
- Pre‑commit checks
  - Compare batch spend distribution (median, 95pct, fraction of spend_outlier) vs baseline; block commit if shifts exceed thresholds (e.g., all_spend_high fraction > 2× baseline).
- Audit queue
  - Route any spend_outlier, spend_dominant without corroboration, large reductions in p_lower vs previous snapshot, and all_abstain batches to human review.
- Stable fallback policy
  - If abstain is not allowed, default rule: prefer segment_prior (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination) when spending is extreme and no corroboration exists.
- Regular re‑evaluation cadence
  - Refit base_weights and calibration after every +50 labels or when per‑segment ECE deviates beyond control limits.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- New diagnostics to persist per prediction
  - total_spend_log1p, spend_robust_z, spend_outlier_flag, top_contrib_source, top_contrib_share, signed_contrib_per_channel, sum_abs_signed_contrib, n_effective_spend, pooled_bin_source, segment_prior, segment_r, calibration_version, snapshot_id.
- Hierarchical pooling + per‑segment priors
  - Use Age buckets and (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination) priors with shrinkage. Both zero and high spend cases should consult those priors before spending dominates.
- Per‑channel max deltas and spend_outlier down‑weight
  - Cap spend deltas and down‑weight or route outliers to fallback models.
- Conservative covariance modeling for spend
  - Inflate covariance among spending channels (empirical or default high corr) to widen CI and avoid over‑confidence.
- GLM fallback for low‑support / outlier cases
  - Train a small regularized logistic (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination, CryoSleep) to provide robust baseline when spend features are unreliable.
- Human‑in‑the‑loop auditing
  - Send spend_dominant mismatches to human review until automated rules stabilize.

Updated deterministic scoring pipeline (v2.2) — production‑ready outline
1. Baseline priors
   - p0_global = (T + 1)/(N + 2); logit0_global = ln(p0_global/(1 − p0_global)).
   - Compute p0_age_bucket and p0_segment (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination) with Laplace smoothing and shrinkage.
2. Age bucketing & pooling
   - Buckets: [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+]. child_flag = Age ≤ 3. Pool small bins upward deterministically.
3. Spending preprocessing & outlier detection
   - Winsorize per‑channel at 0.995; s_i = log1p(x_winsorized); TotalSpend_log1p = Σ s_i.
   - Compute robust median & MAD per segment; spend_robust_z = (TotalSpend_log1p − median)/MAD.
   - spend_outlier = (spend_robust_z ≥ 3.0) OR (TotalSpend_log1p ≥ global_99pct_threshold).
4. Per‑bin smoothing & hierarchical pooling
   - p_b_smoothed = (t_b + alpha)/(n_b + 2*alpha); p_b_shrunk = r_b * p_b_smoothed + (1 − r_b) * p0_effective where r_b = n_b/(n_b + k).
5. Age‑conditioned baseline logit
   - If n_age ≥ min_age_n → logit0_effective = logit0_global + r_age*(logit(p0_age) − logit0_global).
6. Raw deltas and clipping
   - raw_delta_b = ln(p_b_shrunk/(1 − p_b_shrunk)) − logit0_effective.
   - Apply small‑n neutralization and clip:
     - max_delta_nonspend = ±0.8
     - max_delta_spend_channel = ±0.6
7. Grouped spending aggregation & uncertainty
   - n_effective_spend = Σ pooled n_channel.
   - Use empirical Corr_ij for channels or default Corr_spend = 0.8; propagate covariance to get se_logit_final.
   - If spend_outlier True → multiply SpendWeight by spend_outlier_factor (0.5) OR route to fallback.
8. Base weights (rebalanced; normalized)
   - CryoSleep = 0.26
   - Cabin/Deck = 0.21
   - Age = 0.13
   - HomePlanet = 0.10
   - SpendingGroup = 0.10
   - Destination = 0.09
   - Side = 0.04
   - VIP = 0.03
   - child_multiplier = 1.4 if child_flag and r_age ≥ 0.4
9. Dominance & contradiction guards
   - Compute top_contrib_share. If top source = SpendingGroup and top_contrib_share ≥ 0.45 → spend_dominant.
   - If spend_dominant:
     - If spend_outlier True → down‑weight spend OR fallback.
     - Else require (p_lower ≥ 0.75) OR (p_lower ≥ 0.68 AND n_effective_spend ≥ 8 AND at least one non‑spend reliable contributor) else Abstain.
   - If segment_prior_shrunk < 0.45 and spending positive & dominant → enforce stricter p_lower or Abstain.
10. Final aggregation, calibration & decision
   - logit_final = logit0_effective + Σ signed_contrib_i (with adjusted spend weights).
   - se_logit_final via covariance propagation; for spend_dominant/spend_outlier use z = 1.64 else z = 1.28.
   - p_raw = sigmoid(logit_final); p_calibrated = Platt_map(p_raw).
   - p_lower = compute CI using calibrated mapping and se mapping (apply Platt mapping to logit and propagate).
   - Decision rules (deployable defaults):
     - If support_abs_total < T_low (0.035) and reliable_nonspend_count < 1 → Abstain.
     - If all_spend_zero → apply all_spend_zero segment prior path (as earlier).
     - If spend_dominant → apply spend_dominant acceptance rules above.
     - Else:
       - Predict True if support_pos > support_neg AND (support_pos ≥ support_pos_min (0.06) OR reliable_pos_count ≥2) AND p_lower ≥ p_lower_pos_threshold (0.55).
       - Predict False symmetrically; otherwise Abstain.

Concrete parameter defaults (v2.2)
- Laplace alpha = 1; shrinkage k = 5; k_age = 10
- min_bin_count = 10; min_age_n = 30
- winsor_pct = 0.995; max_delta_spend = ±0.6; max_delta_nonspend = ±0.8
- Corr_spend default = 0.8; group k2_group = 7
- spend_outlier_z = 3.0; spend_outlier_factor = 0.5
- dominance_top_share_threshold = 0.45; n_effective_spend_secondary = 8
- p_lower_spend_strong = 0.75; p_lower_spend_secondary = 0.68
- p_lower_pos_threshold = 0.55; T_low = 0.035; support_pos_min = 0.06
- z_normal = 1.28; z_spend_special = 1.64

Validation & experiments to run immediately
- LOO evaluation on labeled set using v2.2 (no retrain of base_weights initially). Report Brier, accuracy, recall, precision, abstain fraction, per‑age bucket confusion, per‑spending‑profile confusion. Confirm whether 0035_01 flips to Abstain/False and that previous zero‑spend case (0034_01) is still corrected.
- Focused spend‑dominant FPR test:
  - Extract all historical cases where SpendingGroup was top contributor and sweep decision thresholds to find p_lower tradeoffs.
- Outlier policy experiments:
  - spend_outlier_z ∈ {2.5, 3.0, 3.5} and spend_outlier_factor ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.75}.
- Covariance sensitivity:
  - Corr_spend ∈ {0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9} to validate CI coverage.
- Calibration experiments: Platt vs isotonic and per‑segment Platt adjustments. Compute ECE per segment.
- Coverage bootstrap: verify nominal CI coverage (90%/95%) across spend_dominant, spend_outlier, zero‑spend, and regular segments.

Monitoring & alerts (fields to compute & thresholds)
- Persist per prediction: p_calibrated, p_lower, p_upper, se_logit_final, support_pos/neg/abs_total, reliable_nonspend_count, top_contribs & top_contrib_share, spend_robust_z, spend_outlier_flag, spend_outlier_factor_applied, pooled_bin_source, segment_prior, snapshot_id, calibration_version.
- Dashboards + alerts:
  - Spend‑dominant FPR & FNR over time (alert if FPR increases by >10%).
  - Fraction of spend_outlier cases by batch (alert if > baseline*2).
  - Per‑segment ECE & CI coverage (alert if coverage drops > 5%).
  - Batch precommit: if spend distribution (median/95pct) shifts by factor >2 → block and require manual review.
- Audit triggers:
  - All spend_outlier cases, spend_dominant cases that are predicted True with p_lower < 0.75, and all cases hit by fallback GLM.

Rollout checklist (prioritized)
Immediate (24–48h)
1. Implement spend_dominant detection, spend_outlier guard and per‑channel max_delta for spending.
2. Rebalance base weights (reduce SpendWeight, raise Age).
3. Inflate spend covariance to Corr_spend = 0.8 by default and recompute p_lower logic.
4. Add per‑prediction diagnostics (spend_robust_z, top_contrib_share, spend_outlier_flag, snapshot_id).
5. Run quick LOO test and check 0035_01 and 0034_01 behaviors.
Near term (1–2 weeks)
1. Tune thresholds (p_lower_spend_strong, p_lower_spend_secondary, spend_outlier_z) using validation.
2. Add per‑segment Platt calibrators; build dashboards and audit queue.
3. Add GLM fallback for spend_outlier and low‑support segments.
Medium term (after +50 labels)
1. Implement full hierarchical Bayesian pooling for spend/age/segment.
2. Refit base_weights with small supervised optimization subject to regularization and fairness constraints.
3. Add human audits to refine rules for unusual spend patterns.
Long term
1. Consider small supervised model trained to encode these decision rules (regularized GLM or tree) that produces calibrated probabilities with bootstrap uncertainty.
2. Move from ad hoc thresholds to policy learned by optimizing batch objective with abstain costs included.

Case‑level diagnosis — 0035_01 and expected outcomes under v2.2
- Why it failed originally: multiple huge spend contributions created a strong positive signal; covariance and clipping were insufficient, so p_lower exceeded the acceptance threshold without non‑spend corroboration → predicted True (False positive).
- v2.2 handling:
  - Total spend will be flagged as spend_outlier (robust z >> 3) and spend weights will be down‑weighted or routed to GLM fallback.
  - Spend_dominant detection will require stronger p_lower (0.75) or corroboration from non‑spend features.
  - Per‑channel max_delta will reduce single‑channel sway.
  - se_logit_final will be larger due to higher spend correlation → p_lower will be lower.
- Expected outcome: either Abstain (preferred) or Predict False with correct CI; significantly reduced chance of False‑positive on this pattern.

Expected tradeoffs
- Short term: decrease in spend‑driven recall (some true positives that were spend‑dominant may move to Abstain); expected reduction in FP rate on spend‑dominant cases.
- Increase in Abstain and audit volume initially while thresholds are tuned.
- Longer term: lower FPR with stable or improved overall Brier/ECE after per‑segment calibration and reweighting.

Immediate action I can take for you
- Produce a deterministic Python scoring function implementing v2.2 (with spend_dominant/outlier guards, deltas clipping, covariance handling, Platt calibration and diagnostics).
- Run LOO evaluation on your labeled set and produce the validation report (Brier, ECE, accuracy, recall, per‑segment confusion matrices) and confirm the behavior on 0035_01 and 0034_01.
Tell me which you want first (scorer code, LOO report, or both), and I will deliver the concrete artifacts and a short runbook for deployment.
