PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 17
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate cause: this batch error (0034_01) is a different manifestation of the same systemic weakness we previously saw: the pipeline over-relies on spending evidence and treats absence of spend as neutral/negative rather than interpreting it in the context of segment priors (Age × Cabin/Deck × Destination × CryoSleep). For 0034_01 (Age 28, all spends = 0, CryoSleep = True, Cabin D/1/S, Destination 55 Cancri e) the lack of spending evidence combined with low relative Age contribution and conservative decision thresholds produced a False prediction even though the segment prior supported Transported=True.
- Top priorities (deploy in order):
  1. Implement Age bucketing + hierarchical pooling and an explicit all_spend_zero guard that routes to segment priors (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination), with a child_override path kept but not the only special-case.
  2. Increase Age weight modestly and add Age-conditioned baseline/logit offset so mid‑age adults (25–44) also influence logit appropriately; keep prior spending-group fixes but ensure zero-spend does not dominate.
  3. Recalibrate final logits (global Platt + per‑segment calibration), and adjust p_lower acceptance thresholds per Age bucket and per-spend-profile.
  4. Strengthen batch pre‑commit checks (Age/spend distribution shifts) and persist deterministic snapshots for binning and pooling.
  5. Run LOO/stratified evaluation and tune thresholds (p_lower, child_override, dominance thresholds) using labeled data before full rollout.

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- Underweighted Age and missing Age-conditioned baseline:
  - Age had a small base weight (previously ~0.07). For mid-age adults the Age contribution was not strong enough to offset other small/negative signals when spending evidence was absent.
- Over-reliance on spending evidence and zero-spend suppression:
  - Pipeline treated absence of spend as low evidence rather than contextual evidence; aggregated spending logic and thresholds allowed zero_total_spend to suppress positive segment priors.
- Aggressive small‑n neutralization + pooling gaps:
  - Per-bin Laplace + reliability shrinkage neutralized signals in small bins; deterministic bin merging/pooling rules were not fully robust, so some useful segments did not provide enough evidence.
- Conservative decision thresholds + dominance guards:
  - support_pos_min, p_lower and dominance rules prefer False/Abstain under weak evidence. With zero spend and weak Age weight, the final p_lower fell below accept thresholds.
- Missing segment-level interaction features:
  - The pipeline lacked explicit hierarchical pooling for (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck × Destination) causing it to miss segment-level priors that would have supported True for this passenger.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
- Age bucketing & hierarchical pooling (all ages):
  - Define Age buckets: [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+]. If fine-grained age bins have n < min_bin_count, pool into the parent bucket; compute pooled n/t and reliability r_age.
  - Use age-conditioned baseline logit: logit0_effective = logit0_global + r_age*(logit0_age − logit0_global) when n_age ≥ min_segment_count_age.
- All_spend_zero guard (generalized, not only children):
  - Detect all_spend_zero or low_total_spend and route the prediction to a segment_prior evaluation: compute p_seg_shrunk for (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination) using hierarchical pooling. If p_seg_shrunk ≥ p_seg_accept and r_seg ≥ r_seg_min → Predict True (or at least relax p_lower).
  - Recommended: p_seg_accept_primary = 0.62, r_seg_min = 0.6. If p_seg_shrunk ∈ [0.58,0.62) but r_seg ≥ r_seg_min → raise p_lower acceptance threshold by +0.02 (allow earlier acceptance).
- Child override remains stronger but not exclusive:
  - child_flag = (Age ≤ 3) → apply child_multiplier to Age contribution and lower acceptance p thresholds for segment priors where appropriate (child_override_primary_p = 0.62).
- Adjust dominance & spending guards:
  - When spending_group is top contributor, only allow Predict True if p_lower ≥ p_lower_group_strong (0.70) or p_lower ≥ p_lower_group_secondary (0.62) and n_effective_spend ≥ dominance_group_secondary_n_min (8). But do not let zero spend dominate negation — route to all_spend_zero logic first.
- Decision rule precision:
  - Normalize raw feature weights to 1. Compute logit_final = logit0_effective + Σ signed_contribs. Compute se_logit_final with covariance. Compute p_lower = sigmoid(logit_final − z*se). Use tiered thresholds (see section 4).

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Zero spend ≠ low probability uniformly:
  - Many segments (including mid-age adults in certain Cabins/Destinations) show low spending but high transport rates. Treating zero spend as uniformly weak/negative is incorrect.
- Age × Cabin × Destination interactions matter for spendless passengers:
  - Segment-level priors combining Age_bucket, Cabin_deck and Destination can predict transported status even when spending features are null.
- Binning & pooling choices materially affect tail behavior:
  - Fine-grained bin splits with small n erase real patterns. Hierarchical pooling is essential for stable tail estimates.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Two-stage calibration:
  - (A) Fit a global Platt scaling on logit_final to output p_calibrated.
  - (B) Compute per‑segment calibration curves (Age buckets & SpendingGroup) and apply per-segment p_lower adjustments or keep segment-specific p_lower thresholds.
- Revised confidence acceptance tiers (starting suggestions — tune on validation):
  - High-confidence accept: p_lower ≥ 0.70, support_abs_total ≥ 0.08, reliable_count_in_direction ≥ 2, top_contrib_share ≤ 0.35.
  - Medium-confidence: p_lower ≥ 0.58 and support_abs_total ≥ 0.05 → Predict True/False depending on sign.
  - Low-confidence / Abstain: p_lower < 0.58 or support_abs_total < 0.05 or top_contrib_share > 0.45.
- Segment-specific relaxation:
  - For Age_bucket 25–44 with r_age ≥ 0.5 and all_spend_zero → allow medium-confidence acceptance at p_lower ≥ 0.60 (instead of 0.58). For child_flag ≤ 3, allow even looser thresholds where justified.
- CI and z:
  - Use z = 1.28 (90%) for standard operation. For safety-critical deployments or when abstain is unavailable, use z = 1.64 (95%).

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Snapshot/version control:
  - Persist snapshot_id containing bin boundaries, per-bin counts (n_bin, t_bin), Corr_ij matrix and pooling merges. Use a snapshot consistently across a batch and only update in controlled deployment with validation.
- Deterministic merging rules:
  - Bin merges must be deterministic and recorded in snapshot. Pool to parent bins until pooled_n ≥ min_bin_count.
- Stable defaults & fallback policies:
  - If Abstain isn't possible, default policies should be explicit: e.g., prefer False for ambiguous spending-dominant extremes, but prefer True for all_spend_zero segments where p_seg_shrunk ≥ 0.62.
- Pre-commit checks:
  - KS or chi-square on Age and spend distribution vs baseline; pause auto-commit if Age distribution shifts > factor 2 or all_spend_zero fraction > 2× baseline.
- Audit queue:
  - Create audit queue for all cases that hit child_override, all_spend_zero segment path, and for batches with spending_group_dominant fraction > batch_dominance_alert_rate.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Persist new diagnostics per prediction:
  - age_bucket_id, child_flag, age_segment_n, age_segment_t, pooled_bin_source, all_spend_zero, total_spend, segment_prior, segment_r, calibration_version, snapshot_id.
- Hierarchical Bayesian/Empirical Bayes pooling:
  - Implement pooling for Age buckets and combined segments so tails borrow strength from parent bins.
- Segment-specific CI coverage monitoring:
  - Track CI coverage (proportion of true y inside p_lower..p_upper) per Age bucket and SpendingGroup; alert on degradation.
- Light-weight GLM fallback:
  - For low-support segments (n_segment < threshold), fallback to a small regularized GLM on Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination and CryoSleep to provide robust baseline predictions.
- Human-in-the-loop for edge cases:
  - Audit queue for Abstain and conflicting cases where segment priors and spending-group disagree.

Updated deterministic scoring pipeline (v2.0 → v2.1) — production-ready outline
1. Baseline priors
   - p0_global = (T + 1) / (N + 2); logit0_global = ln(p0_global / (1 − p0_global)).
   - Compute p0_age_bucket for Age buckets with n_age ≥ min_segment_count_age (30).
2. Age bucketing & pooling
   - Age buckets: [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+].
   - child_flag = (Age ≤ 3).
   - If fine-grained age bin n < min_bin_count → pool into parent bucket; compute n_age, t_age, r_age.
3. Spending preprocessing
   - winsorize spend features at percentile 0.995; s_i = log1p(x_winsorized); TotalSpend_log1p = Σ s_i.
   - all_spend_zero = (TotalSpend_log1p == 0); low_total_spend = (TotalSpend_log1p ≤ 0.5).
4. Per-bin Laplace smoothing + reliability shrinkage + hierarchical pooling
   - For each bin b: p_b_smoothed = (t_b + alpha) / (n_b + 2*alpha). Then p_b_shrunk = r_b*p_b_smoothed + (1 − r_b)*p0_effective where r_b = n_b/(n_b + k).
   - If n_b < min_bin_count → pool up to parent until pooled_n ≥ min_bin_count; track pooled_bin_source.
5. Age-conditioned baseline/logit offset
   - If n_age ≥ min_segment_count_age (30):
     - logit0_effective = logit0_global + r_age*(ln(p0_age/(1−p0_age)) − logit0_global), k_age = 10.
   - Else logit0_effective = logit0_global.
6. Raw deltas, small‑n neutralization & clipping
   - raw_delta_b = ln(p_b_shrunk/(1−p_b_shrunk)) − logit0_effective.
   - Apply small‑n neutralization scale factors and clip raw_delta_b to ±max_delta (±0.8).
7. Grouped spending aggregation
   - Compute per-channel signed contribs, n_effective_spend = Σ pooled n_channel; r_group = n_effective_spend/(n_effective_spend + k2_group).
   - Covariance/correlation use empirical Corr_ij if available else default Corr_spend = 0.6.
   - Treat SpendingGroup as synthetic feature with delta and se.
8. Base weights (revised defaults; normalize to 1)
   - CryoSleep = 0.26
   - Cabin/Deck = 0.22
   - HomePlanet = 0.11
   - SpendingGroup = 0.12
   - Destination = 0.09
   - Age = 0.11  (raised from 0.07)
   - Side = 0.05
   - VIP = 0.04
   - child_multiplier = 1.5 applied to Age raw_w_age if child_flag True and r_age ≥ 0.4.
9. all_spend_zero & child_override
   - If all_spend_zero:
     - Compute p_seg_shrunk for (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination). If p_seg_shrunk ≥ 0.62 and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → Predict True directly (bypass spending-dominated guards). Else if p_seg_shrunk ∈ [0.58,0.62) and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → lower per-instance acceptance threshold by +0.02.
   - If child_flag & all_spend_zero → child_override_primary thresholds apply (stronger).
10. Final aggregation, CI, calibration & decision
   - Normalize raw_w_i; signed_contrib_i = raw_w_i * delta_i.
   - logit_final = logit0_effective + Σ signed_contrib_i.
   - Propagate covariance to get se_logit_final.
   - p_calibrated = Platt(sigmoid(logit_final)) — fit Platt on validation LOO.
   - Compute p_lower = sigmoid(platt_logit − z*se_platt_equivalent) — maintain nominal CI via calibration mapping.
   - Decision rules:
     - If support_abs_total < T_low (0.035) and max(reliable_pos_count,reliable_neg_count) < 2 → Abstain.
     - If child_override or all_spend_zero segment primary condition → Predict True.
     - If spending_group top contributor → require p_lower ≥ p_lower_group_strong (0.70) or (p_lower ≥ p_lower_group_secondary (0.62) and n_effective_spend ≥ 8), else Abstain.
     - Else Non-group-dominant: Predict True if support_pos > support_neg AND (support_pos ≥ support_pos_min (0.06) OR reliable_pos_count ≥ 2) AND p_lower ≥ p_lower_pos_threshold (0.55). Symmetric for Predict False; otherwise Abstain.

Rollout checklist (prioritized)
Immediate (24–48h)
1. Implement Age buckets and hierarchical pooling (deterministic).
2. Add all_spend_zero detection and segment_prior pathway for all ages; add child_flag and child_override pathway.
3. Keep spending_group aggregator but ensure zero-spend guard prevents spend absence from overpowering segment priors.
4. Add Platt calibration step and persist calibration_version.
5. Add per-prediction diagnostics (age_bucket_id, child_flag, pooled_bin_source, all_spend_zero) and batch pre-commit checks.
Near-term (1–2 weeks)
1. Run LOO validation and tune thresholds (p_lower, child_override).
2. Set up dashboards for Age-bucket CI coverage & ECE; create audit queue for Abstain and all_spend_zero cases.
3. Re-evaluate base_weights after +50 labeled decisions and regularization.
Medium-term (after +50 labels)
1. Implement hierarchical Bayesian pooling for spending bins and Age buckets.
2. Build GLM fallback for low-support segments.
3. Add explicit interaction features (Age × Cabin, TotalSpend × Destination).
Long-term (100+ labels)
1. Consider small supervised calibrated model (regularized logistic/GLM) that encodes these aggregations and provides uncertainty estimates via bootstrap or Bayesian approx.

Case-level diagnosis — 0034_01 and expected outcomes under v2.1
- Why it failed originally: all_spend_zero + low Age weight + conservative thresholds → insufficient positive signed_contribs; spending absence suppressed positive evidence; pipeline defaulted to False.
- v2.1 handling:
  - all_spend_zero triggers segment_prior computation for (Age_bucket 25–44, Cabin D/1/S, Destination 55 Cancri e). That pooled segment is likely to have higher n and a meaningful transported prior. If p_seg_shrunk ≥ 0.62 and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → v2.1 will Predict True (bypassing spending-dominant negative bias). If segment prior is lower but reliable, v2.1 will lower per-instance threshold so at minimum this becomes Abstain rather than a False.
- Expected outcome: Predict True or Abstain (rather than False) — reducing FN.

Expected tradeoffs
- Recall improvement (especially for zero-spend segments and children); short-term increase in Abstain rate as system prefers safety for spending-dominant conflicts.
- Potential slight FP increase in broad Age buckets if p_lower thresholds loosen too much; controlled via validation and segment-specific thresholds.
- Operational overhead: more auditing on Abstain and pause-on-shifts until calibration stabilizes.

Short actionable deployment checklist (first-steps)
1. Implement Age buckets and deterministic hierarchical pooling + persist snapshot_id.
2. Implement all_spend_zero guard routing to segment_prior; implement child_flag & child_override.
3. Add Platt calibration pipeline and per-prediction diagnostics.
4. Run immediate LOO using v2.1 and report: Brier, ECE, accuracy, recall, abstain fraction, per-age confusion matrices; verify correction of 0034_01.
5. Tune p_lower and segment thresholds from LOO results; deploy to staging with batch pre‑commit checks on.

How I can help next
- I can deliver:
  A) The concrete Python scoring function implementing v2.1 (deterministic, with Age pooling, all_spend_zero & child_override).
  B) Immediate LOO evaluation on your labeled set (reports: Brier, accuracy, abstain stats, per-age confusion matrices, and whether 0034_01 is corrected).
  C) Both (scorer + LOO).
Which would you like me to produce first?
