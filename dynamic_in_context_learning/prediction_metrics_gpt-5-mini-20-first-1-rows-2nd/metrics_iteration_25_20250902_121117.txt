PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 25
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate cause: 0044_02 is a zero‑spend false negative. The pipeline routed the case down the “all_spend_zero → segment prior” path and the (shrunk) segment prior + CryoSleep signal produced a confident negative. The model under‑weighted Age/CryoSleep interactions for young passengers and had no contradiction/GLM fallback for small or inconsistent segment priors → confident False (predicted False, actual True).
- Top priorities (deploy in order):
  1. Harden the all_spend_zero path: add GLM fallback + conservative decision rules for negative predictions; require corroboration for confident negatives when spends are zero.
  2. Add CryoSleep × Age interactions and extend child multipliers to 4–12; reduce CryoSleep absolute weight for young children.
  3. Increase min_bin_count and tighten small‑n pooling/shrinkage logic; route under‑supported segments to fallback instead of relying on noisy segment priors.
  4. Add contradiction guard (non‑spend corroboration check) that forces Abstain/GLM when non‑spend signals and segment prior disagree.
  5. Strengthen monitoring for all_spend_zero FNR, CryoSleep–age miscalibration, and per‑segment CI coverage; block commits on large distribution shifts.

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- All_spend_zero routing: all spend channels were zero, so the pipeline relied on the segment prior. That prior was either small‑n or differently pooled and pulled the probability down.
- Small‑n / shrinkage mismatch: the segment’s observed n or pool structure produced a shrunk prior that did not reflect the true local behavior (high variance in small segments).
- Missing CryoSleep × Age interaction: CryoSleep was treated uniformly; for young children CryoSleep’s predictive relationship with Transported differs and the current model weighed CryoSleep too strongly in the negative direction for this age.
- Lack of contradiction guard / GLM fallback: no separate model was asked to validate a segment‑prior based decision when non‑spend features (Age, Cabin, VIP, CryoSleep) provided conflicting evidence.
- Low tolerance for low‑support negatives: T_low and negative thresholds allowed confident negative predictions with insufficient non‑spend corroboration.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
- All_spend_zero special path (NEW)
  - If all spend channels == 0:
    - If segment_n >= min_bin_count AND |p_segment_shrunk − p_age_shrunk| < delta_consistency → use segment_prior path.
    - Else → route to GLM_fallback (regularized logistic trained on Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination, CryoSleep, VIP, HomePlanet, Side). Use GLM for decision and for uncertainty (bootstrap or analytic).
    - Decision for all_spend_zero:
      - Positive: require p_lower_glm ≥ p_lower_zero_pos (default 0.60).
      - Negative: require p_upper_glm ≤ p_upper_zero_neg (default 0.30). Otherwise Abstain.
- Contradiction guard (GENERAL)
  - Compute nonspend_support_pos and nonspend_support_neg (sum of absolute signed deltas excluding spend channels).
  - If top_contrib_source = SegmentPrior (or SpendingGroup) and sign conflicts with nonspend_support and nonspend_support_abs ≥ nonspend_support_min (default 0.06) → Abstain/GLM.
- CryoSleep × Age interactions
  - Implement per‑age bucket CryoSleep effect adjustments:
    - If Age ≤ 3: child_infant_flag → infant CryoSleep weight = base * 1.2 (if historically reinforced), else specialize.
    - If Age ∈ [4,12]: reduce CryoSleep weight by factor cryo_child_factor (default 0.6).
    - Recompute signed contributions accordingly.
- Strengthen small‑n pooling/smoothing
  - Increase min_bin_count and increase shrinkage k for segments; if n_b < min_bin_count → automatically route to GLM_fallback rather than trusting noisy p_b_shrunk.
- Conservative negative thresholds for low‑spend
  - Increase T_low (support_abs_total) and require stricter p_upper for negatives if spends are zero or low. Prefer Abstain over confident False when contradictory signals exist.
- Persist decision provenance: every all_spend_zero case must include segment_n, p_segment_shrunk, p_age_shrunk, GLM_fallback_prob, and contradiction_flag in the diagnostics.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Zero spend does not equal not transported: children and specific cabins/destinations may have very low or zero spend but high transported probability (e.g., guardians using parental payments, tickets with no onboard spending).
- CryoSleep’s predictive sign and magnitude varies with age; uniform CryoSleep weighting hides important interactions.
- Segment priors for fine-grained bins (Age × Deck × Destination) are fragile when sparse — behavior of small segments can be counterintuitive and should not be used without fallbacks.
- Both tails (extreme spenders and zero spenders) require explicit and distinct logic (we already have spend-outlier rules; now we add a symmetric zero‑spend pathway).

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Define p_lower and p_upper:
  - p_lower = p_calibrated − z * se_mapped (lower bound)
  - p_upper = p_calibrated + z * se_mapped (upper bound)
  - Use z_normal = 1.28 (90% band) by default; for special cases inflate z to increase conservatism.
- Two‑stage calibration:
  - Global Platt scaling on raw model logits → p_calibrated.
  - Per‑segment (Age_bucket × SpendingGroup) Platt offsets or isotonic adjustments for segments with > min_platt_n (default 200).
- Tiered thresholds (initial defaults; tune on validation)
  - Regular predictions:
    - High‑confidence Positive: p_lower ≥ 0.75
    - High‑confidence Negative: p_upper ≤ 0.25
    - Medium: p_lower ∈ [0.60, 0.75) or p_upper ∈ (0.25, 0.40]
    - Abstain otherwise
  - Spend‑dominant: raise thresholds by +0.05 for both sides
  - All_spend_zero: be more conservative for negatives:
    - Positive (from GLM or aggregated): p_lower ≥ 0.60
    - Negative: require p_upper ≤ 0.30 (not 0.25) and GLM_concurrence if segment_n < min_bin_count
  - Use z_spend_special/z_zero_special = 1.64 for spend_dominant or zero‑spend special cases when computing p_lower/p_upper.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Deterministic snapshoting:
  - Persist snapshot_id containing bin boundaries, pooled merges and Corr_ij. Use snapshot_id for an entire batch commit (no ad‑hoc re‑pooling mid‑batch).
- GLM fallback service:
  - Ship a small, deterministic GLM_fallback model versioned with the snapshot; all under‑supported or zero‑spend cases call the same GLM.
- Pre‑commit distribution checks:
  - Block commit if fraction_all_spend_zero > baseline*2 or median_age shifts > X years or cryosleep fraction shifts > 2× baseline.
- Audit queue:
  - Route all_glm_fallback_used, contradiction_flagled, all_spend_zero predicted False with p_upper > 0.25, and top_contrib_share > 0.45 to human review.
- Deterministic pooling & merge logs:
  - Record pooling path and pooled_bin_source per prediction; use identical pooling across training/validation/inference.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Persist per‑prediction diagnostics (new fields)
  - all_spend_zero_flag, segment_n, p_segment_shrunk, p_age_shrunk, GLM_fallback_prob, GLM_p_lower/p_upper, contradiction_flag, cryo_child_adjust_applied, top_contrib_source, top_contrib_share, support_abs_total, reliable_nonspend_count, snapshot_id, calibration_version.
- GLM fallback & bootstrap uncertainty
  - Train a compact regularized GLM (or shallow tree) specifically for low‑spend / small‑n segments. Use bootstrap to estimate se for GLM outputs and incorporate into p_lower/p_upper.
- Age bucketing & child multipliers
  - Keep [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+] buckets but apply child multipliers for 4–12 as well (smaller than infant multiplier).
- Per‑segment Platt and targeted isotonic calibrators
  - For segments that show systematic miscalibration (all_spend_zero FNR or spend_dominant FPR) fit local Platt calibrators.
- Decision provenance for audits
  - Persist the why: which rule was used, which fallback, and which contradictions triggered Abstain/Audit.

Updated deterministic scoring pipeline (v2.3) — production‑ready outline
1. Baseline priors
   - p0_global = (T + 1)/(N + 2); logit0_global = ln(p0_global/(1 − p0_global)).
   - Compute p0_age_bucket and p0_segment with Laplace smoothing (alpha = 1) and hierarchical pooling where applicable.
2. Age bucketing & child multipliers
   - Buckets: [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+].
   - child_multiplier:
     - Age ≤ 3 → 1.40
     - Age ∈ [4,12] → 1.20 (applied conditionally when r_age ≥ 0.4)
3. Spending preprocessing & outlier detection
   - Winsorize per‑channel at 0.995; s_i = log1p(x_winsorized); TotalSpend_log1p = Σ s_i.
   - Compute robust median & MAD per segment; spend_robust_z = (TotalSpend_log1p − median)/MAD.
   - spend_outlier = (spend_robust_z ≥ 3.0) OR (TotalSpend_log1p ≥ global_99pct_threshold).
   - all_spend_zero = all s_i == 0.
4. Per‑bin smoothing & hierarchical pooling
   - p_b_smoothed = (t_b + alpha)/(n_b + 2*alpha); shrinkage r_b = n_b/(n_b + k) with k_segment = 10.
   - min_bin_count = 20; min_age_n = 30.
5. All_spend_zero special path (NEW)
   - If all_spend_zero:
     - If n_segment ≥ min_bin_count AND |p_segment_shrunk − p_age_shrunk| < delta_consistency (0.15) → use segment prior branch.
     - Else → compute GLM_fallback_prob (versioned). Get p_glm, p_lower_glm/p_upper_glm via bootstrap.
     - Decision:
       - If p_lower_glm ≥ 0.60 → Predict True.
       - If p_upper_glm ≤ 0.30 → Predict False.
       - Else → Abstain (send to audit if required).
6. Raw deltas and clipping
   - raw_delta_b = ln(p_b_shrunk/(1 − p_b_shrunk)) − logit0_effective (Age‑conditioned).
   - Clip:
     - max_delta_nonspend = ±0.8
     - max_delta_spend_channel = ±0.6
7. CryoSleep × Age adjustments (NEW)
   - Compute cryo_adjust_factor:
     - Age ≤ 3: 1.0 (or boosted if validated)
     - Age ∈ [4,12]: cryo_child_factor = 0.6 (reduce CryoSleep contribution)
     - Apply cryo_adjust to signed CryoSleep delta.
8. Grouped spending aggregation & uncertainty
   - n_effective_spend = Σ pooled n_channel.
   - Corr_spend default = 0.8; propagate covariance to get se_logit_final.
   - If spend_outlier True → apply spend_outlier_factor = 0.5 OR route to spend-outlier fallback.
9. Rebalanced base weights (starting defaults)
   - CryoSleep = 0.20 (age adjusted)
   - Cabin/Deck = 0.22
   - Age = 0.16
   - HomePlanet = 0.09
   - SpendingGroup = 0.08
   - Destination = 0.09
   - Side = 0.03
   - VIP = 0.02
   - Normalize weights and apply child_multiplier when triggered.
10. Dominance & contradiction guards
    - Compute top_contrib_share = |signed_contrib_top| / Σ|signed_contrib_i|.
    - If top_contrib_source == SpendingGroup and top_contrib_share ≥ 0.45 → spend_dominant rules (as v2.2).
    - If top_contrib_source == SegmentPrior and contradiction with non‑spend support (nonspend_support_abs ≥ 0.06) → Abstain/GLM.
11. Final aggregation, calibration & decision
    - logit_final = logit0_effective + Σ signed_contrib_i (with adjustments).
    - se_logit_final via covariance propagation; use z = 1.28 normally; use z = 1.64 for spend_dominant, spend_outlier, or all_spend_zero special decisions.
    - p_raw = sigmoid(logit_final); p_calibrated = Platt_map(p_raw) + per‑segment offsets where available.
    - Compute p_lower and p_upper and apply tiered thresholds above.
    - Decision priority:
      - If all_spend_zero → follow the all_spend_zero path decision.
      - Else if spend_dominant → apply spend‑dominant acceptance rules (p_lower thresholds increased).
      - Else follow standard thresholds (positive if p_lower ≥ 0.75; negative if p_upper ≤ 0.25; medium ranges lead to Abstain).
    - Persist diagnostics.

- Corr_spend default = 0.8; group k2_group = 7
- spend_outlier_z = 3.0; spend_outlier_factor = 0.5
- dominance_top_share_threshold = 0.45; n_effective_spend_secondary = 8
- p_lower_spend_strong = 0.75; p_lower_spend_secondary = 0.68
- p_lower_pos_threshold = 0.75; p_upper_neg_threshold = 0.25

- child multipliers: Age ≤3 = 1.40; Age 4–12 = 1.20
- cryo_child_factor = 0.6

Validation & experiments to run immediately
- LOO evaluation on full labeled set using v2.3 (no weight retrain initially). Report:
  - Brier, accuracy, recall, precision, abstain fraction, per‑age bucket confusion, per‑spending profile confusion.
  - Confirm behavior on 0044_02 and previously failing cases 0034_01/0035_01.
- All_spend_zero FNR test:
  - Extract historical all_spend_zero cases and compute FNR/FPR under v2.3 vs v2.2.
  - Sweep GLM thresholds (p_lower_zero_pos ∈ {0.55,0.60,0.65}, p_upper_zero_neg ∈ {0.25,0.30,0.35}).
- CryoSleep × Age ablation:
  - Test cryo_child_factor ∈ {0.5,0.6,0.8,1.0} and child multipliers to find optimal balance.
- Small-n pooling sensitivity:
  - min_bin_count ∈ {10,20,30} and k_segment ∈ {5,10,15}.
- Calibration experiments:
  - Global Platt vs isotonic; per‑segment Platt for Age_bucket × SpendingGroup; compute ECE per segment.
- Coverage bootstrap:
  - Verify nominal CI coverage (90%/95%) across spend_dominant, spend_outlier, zero_spend, and regular segments.

Monitoring & alerts (fields to compute & thresholds)
- Persist per prediction:
  - p_calibrated, p_lower, p_upper, se_logit_final, support_pos/neg/abs_total, reliable_nonspend_count, top_contribs & top_contrib_share, spend_robust_z, all_spend_zero_flag, GLM_fallback_used, GLM_p, segment_n, p_segment_shrunk, p_age_shrunk, contradiction_flag, cryo_child_adjust_applied, snapshot_id, calibration_version.
- Dashboards + alerts:
  - All_spend_zero FNR & FPR (alert if FNR increases by >10%).
  - Spend_dominant FPR & spend_outlier fraction (alert if > baseline*2).
  - Fraction of GLM_fallback_used per batch (alert if > baseline*1.5).
  - Per‑segment ECE & CI coverage (alert if coverage drops > 5%).
  - Batch precommit: block if fraction_all_spend_zero > baseline*2 or median_age shifts by >2 years.
- Audit triggers:
  - All GLM_fallback_used, contradiction_flag cases, all_spend_zero predicted False with p_upper > 0.30, and spend_dominant predicted True with p_lower < 0.75.

Case‑level diagnosis — 0044_02 and expected outcomes under v2.3
- Why it failed originally:
  - all_spend_zero path used a (shrunk) segment prior that favored False; CryoSleep weighted negatively; no GLM fallback or contradiction guard existed to detect the conflicting non‑spend evidence (Age = 4).
- v2.3 handling:
  - all_spend_zero == True → check segment_n and consistency with Age prior.
  - If segment_n < min_bin_count OR |p_segment_shrunk − p_age_shrunk| ≥ 0.15 → GLM_fallback used.
  - GLM will evaluate Age=4, CryoSleep True, Cabin and Destination; likely yields higher p_glm for transported → p_lower_glm ≥ 0.60 → Predict True (or else Abstain).
  - CryoSleep contribution is reduced for Age 4 via cryo_child_factor → lower negative pull.
- Expected outcome: Predict True or Abstain (preferred over confident False). The false negative should be eliminated.

Expected tradeoffs
- Short term: increase in Abstain/GLM_fallback use and audit volume; modest decrease in auto negative predictions for zero‑spend cases (lower FNR).
- Medium term: better overall calibration and lower FNR on zero‑spend / child segments; small decrease in spend‑driven recall due to stronger spend outlier protections.
- Long term: after per‑segment calibration and retraining/refitting of base weights the abstain rate should come down and stable Brier/ECE will improve.

Rollout checklist (prioritized)
Immediate (24–48h)
1. Implement all_spend_zero detection + GLM_fallback + conservative negative thresholds; deploy GLM as service/versioned artifact.
2. Add CryoSleep × Age adjustments and child multipliers.
3. Increase min_bin_count and change k_segment to 10. Persist additional diagnostics.
4. Run quick LOO test and check 0044_02 and prior failing cases.
Near term (1–2 weeks)
1. Tune GLM thresholds and cryo_child_factor on validation folds.
2. Add per‑segment Platt calibrators; build dashboards and audit queue for GLM_fallback and contradiction cases.
3. Add deterministic snapshoting and precommit checks.
Medium term (after +50 labels)
1. Refit base_weights with constrained supervised optimization and regularization.
2. Implement hierarchical Bayesian pooling for more principled small‑n behavior.
Long term
1. Consider small supervised ensemble that learns to combine the deterministic rules with GLM outputs and abstain costs.
2. Continual retraining cadence with human in the loop for audits.

Immediate action I can take for you
- Provide deterministic Python scorer implementing v2.3 (all_spend_zero + GLM_fallback integration stub, deltas clipping, covariance handling, Platt calibration and diagnostics).
- Run LOO evaluation on your labeled set and produce the validation report (Brier, ECE, accuracy, recall, per‑segment confusion matrices) and confirm the corrected behavior on 0044_02 and prior cases.

Which would you like first — the scorer code, the LOO report, or both?
