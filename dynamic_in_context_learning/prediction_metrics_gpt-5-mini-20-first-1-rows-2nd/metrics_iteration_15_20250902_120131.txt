PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 15
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaway and top priorities
- Immediate cause: this batch error (0031_02) is a different failure mode than the earlier multi‑channel spending issue. It exposes insufficient modeling/weighting for age‑driven segments (very young children) and inadequate segment pooling for zero‑spend profiles. The pipeline under‑weighted Age (and Age×Cabin/Deck/Destination interactions), so a young passenger with zero spend was treated as low‑evidence/negative and predicted False despite being Transported=True.
- Top priorities (deploy in order):
  1. Add Age‑bucketing + hierarchical pooling and an explicit child_flag override pathway (Age ≤ 3) so low‑spend young passengers get appropriate prior/feature weight and segment smoothing.
  2. Keep the spending-group fixes (grouped spending, n_effective, covariance, dominance guard) but add an "all_spend_zero" guard that invokes segment/age logic instead of letting zero-spend suppress positive signal by absence.
  3. Recalibrate confidence (p_lower) per segment (Age buckets) and apply Platt/isotonic scaling to logit_final so CI thresholds reflect segment-level calibration.
  4. Strengthen batch pre‑commit checks (distribution shifts on Age, Spending, new bins) and an audit path for segments with historically high FN or high abstain rates.
  5. Run LOO/stratified evaluation focusing on Age buckets and spending profiles; tune thresholds (p_lower_group_strong/secondary) from validation.

1) What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?
- Low Age impact: Age had a relatively small base weight (0.07) and Age binning likely produced small n for very young ages, so Age contributed little to signed_contrib_i.
- Small-n neutralization + shrinkage: Per‑bin Laplace + reliability shrinkage with aggressive small‑n neutralization suppressed any small positive age signal when n_bin < min_bin_count; combined with zero spends, the passenger accumulated insufficient positive support.
- No explicit zero‑spend child handling: absence of spend was treated as neutral/negative (lack of positive evidence) rather than interpreted in context (young children often have low spend but may still be transported).
- Decision thresholds tuned to prefer abstain/false for low evidence: support_pos_min, p_lower thresholds and dominance guard created a conservative rule that favours False when feature evidence is weak or per-bin support is small.
- Snapshot & binning fragility: Age bin granularity likely split infants into bins with n below min_bin_count → heavier shrinkage to global p0.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors in future batches?
- Add Age-bucket segmentation and hierarchical pooling:
  - Create Age buckets (example: 0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+). Ensure min_bin_count applies at bucket level; merge single-year bins into these buckets so infants get robust counts.
  - When a fine-grained age bin has n < min_bin_count, pool into the parent age bucket and use pooled counts for p_b_shrunk and reliability.
- Child override pathway:
  - Introduce child_flag = (Age ≤ 3). If child_flag and all_spend_zero (or low_total_spend) then compute segment_prior for (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination) with hierarchical pooling. If segment_prior p_seg_shrunk ≥ 0.62 and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → Predict True. Else Abstain.
- All_spend_zero guard:
  - Detect all_spend_zero and route to an "absence of spend" logic: do not let lack of spending drag the outcome negative unless other reliable negative evidence exists.
- Age-conditioned baseline & calibration:
  - Use age-conditioned p0_age when n_age >= min_segment_count for smoothing/logit baseline, or apply an age_offset to logit0 weighted by r_age.
- Re-balance base_weights modestly to reflect importance of Age and Cabin for child segments (see suggested new base_weights below), but prefer data-driven reweighting after +50 labels.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Low‑spend does not mean low probability: very young passengers commonly have low/no spending yet are not less likely to be transported — so "zero spend" is not uniformly negative.
- Age interactions matter: Age interacts with Cabin/Deck and Destination. Age alone or spend alone can be misleading; combining Age buckets with Cabin/Destination reveals segments with systematically higher transported rates.
- Binning and pooling choices materially change behavior in tails: when per‑bin counts are small, naive per‑bin neutralization erases real patterns. Hierarchical pooling is critical for stable tail estimates.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Calibrate globally then per‑segment:
  - Fit a global Platt (logistic) calibration on logit_final → p_calibrated.
  - Then compute per‑segment calibration curves for Age buckets (and SpendingGroup buckets) and correct p_calibrated or maintain segment‑specific p_lower thresholds.
- Revised confidence tier thresholds (recommended starting points; tune on validation):
  - High confidence (auto-accept): p_lower ≥ 0.70 AND support_abs_total ≥ 0.08 AND reliable_count_in_direction ≥ 2 AND top_contrib_share ≤ 0.35.
  - Medium confidence: p_lower ≥ 0.58 AND support_abs_total ≥ 0.05.
  - Low confidence / Abstain preferred: p_lower < 0.58 OR support_abs_total < 0.05 OR top_contrib_share > 0.45 OR multi_spend_extreme_count ≥ 2.
- Segment-specific acceptance relaxation:
  - For child_flag (Age ≤ 3) with reliable age_bucket evidence (r_age ≥ 0.6), allow medium-confidence acceptance at p_lower ≥ 0.62 (instead of 0.58). For group-dominant spending, keep stricter p_lower_group_strong ≥ 0.70.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Snapshot/version control for bins and counts:
  - Persist snapshot_id for bin boundaries, per-bin counts (n_bin, t_bin), Corr_ij, and use the same snapshot for an entire batch commit.
  - Only update snapshot in a controlled deployment with validation.
- Deterministic merging rules:
  - Merging adjacent bins must be deterministic, reproducible, and documented in the snapshot so batch runs are consistent.
- Stable default fallbacks:
  - If Abstain unavailable, use explicit policy mapping (e.g., prefer False for ambiguous spending extremes, but prefer True for child_flag segments when segment prior > 0.62).
- Batch pre‑commit checks and pause thresholds:
  - If distribution shift in Age (KS test) or fraction of all_spend_zero passengers increases > 2× historical, pause auto-commit for sampling and audit.
  - If spending_group_dominant fraction > 1% of batch → pause and sample K for human review.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- New diagnostic fields to persist (in addition to earlier list):
  - age_bucket_id, child_flag, age_segment_n, age_segment_t, all_spend_zero, total_spend, segment_prior, segment_r, pooled_bin_source (indicates pooled parent), calibration_version.
- Hierarchical pooling: implement Bayesian/Empirical Bayes pooling for small bins (age, spend bins, combined segments) so tails borrow strength from parents.
- Segment-specific CI coverage monitoring:
  - Track CI coverage rate (proportion true y inside [p_lower, p_upper]) per Age bucket and per SpendingGroup; alert if < expected (calibration failure).
- Add a light-weight fallback GLM per segment:
  - For low-support segments (n_segment < threshold), fall back to a small calibrated GLM trained on a few reliable features (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination, CryoSleep) — this reduces brittleness.
- Human-in-the-loop for edge cases:
  - Add audit queue for Abstain and for conflicting cases where segment priors and spending-group disagree (multi_spend_extreme_count ≥ 2 and child_flag contradictions).

Updated deterministic scoring pipeline (v2.0) — complete (production‑ready, includes child logic)
- Baseline prior:
  - p0_global = (T + 1) / (N + 2); logit0_global = ln(p0_global / (1 − p0_global))
  - Also compute p0_age_bucket for Age buckets where n_age ≥ min_segment_count_age (min_segment_count_age = 30); if available use to form age_offset for logit0 (see below).
- Age bucketing & pooling:
  - Age buckets: [0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+]. When a finer bin has n < min_bin_count, merge into bucket; compute n_age, t_age.
  - child_flag = (Age ≤ 3)
- Spending preprocessing (unchanged from previous patch):
  - winsorize @ 0.995, s_i = log1p(x_winsorized), TotalSpend_log1p = Σ s_i, multi_spend_extreme_count, ratio_top_channel, multi_channel_profile_flag.
- Special flags:
  - all_spend_zero = (TotalSpend_log1p == 0)
  - low_total_spend = (TotalSpend_log1p ≤ small_total_spend_threshold; e.g., ≤ 0.5)
- Per-bin Laplace smoothing and reliability shrinkage (alpha=1; k=5) + hierarchical pooling:
  - For bin b (including Age_buckets and combined segments): compute p_b_smoothed with Laplace, then p_b_shrunk with k.
  - If n_b < min_bin_count (10) → pool with parent bin (e.g., Age_bucket parent or sibling) until pooled_n ≥ min_bin_count; track pooled_bin_source.
- Age-conditioned baseline/logit offset:
  - If n_age ≥ min_segment_count_age (30):
    - logit0_effective = logit0_global + r_age * (ln(p0_age/(1−p0_age)) − logit0_global), where r_age = n_age / (n_age + k_age) and k_age = 10.
  - Else logit0_effective = logit0_global.
- Feature deltas, small‑n neutralization:
  - raw_delta_b = ln(p_b_shrunk / (1 − p_b_shrunk)) − logit0_effective
  - small-n neutralization: same rules as before (n_small = 3 small_n_factor = 0.5; spending_small_bin_factor = 0.35 if spending bin n < min_bin_count).
  - clip raw_delta_b to ±max_delta (max_delta = 0.8).
- Grouped spending (unchanged major design, with minor additions):
  - Compute per-channel signed contribs and group aggregator; n_effective_spend = Σ n_channel (pooled counts); r_group = n_effective_spend / (n_effective_spend + k2_group); k2_group = 7.
  - For cov_delta_ij: use empirical Corr_ij when available; otherwise default Corr_spend = 0.6.
  - Treat SpendingGroup as single synthetic feature with delta and se computed as before.
- Base weights (relative; normalized after reliability scaling) — revised defaults:
  - CryoSleep = 0.26
  - Cabin/Deck = 0.22
  - HomePlanet = 0.11
  - SpendingGroup = 0.12
  - Destination = 0.09
  - Age = 0.11
  - Side = 0.05
  - VIP = 0.04
  - Rationale: raise Age from 0.07 → 0.11 to reflect observed segment importance; spending_group is moderate but still important.
- Age multipliers / child_override:
  - child_multiplier = 1.5 applied to Age raw_w_age if child_flag is True and r_age ≥ 0.4.
  - For child_flag + all_spend_zero:
    - Compute segment_prior p_seg_shrunk for (Age_bucket, Cabin_deck, Destination) using hierarchical pooling. If p_seg_shrunk ≥ 0.62 and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → immediate Predict True (bypass normal group-dominance False pathways). Else if p_seg_shrunk ∈ [0.58, 0.62) and r_seg ≥ 0.6 → set p_lower acceptance threshold to 0.60 instead of 0.58; else proceed to normal pipeline (likely Abstain).
- Final weights, dominance and Abstain rules (incorporates previous spending-dominant guards):
  - Normalize raw_w_i to sum = 1
  - Compute signed_contribs, logit_final = logit0_effective + Σ signed_contrib_i
  - Compute se_logit_final with covariance propagation
  - p_lower = sigmoid(logit_final − z * se_logit_final), z=1.28 (90%), adjust to 1.64 (95%) in high‑safety regimes
  - Decision rules:
    - If support_abs_total < T_low(0.035) and max(reliable_pos_count,reliable_neg_count) < 2 → Abstain
    - If child_override condition (above) → Predict True
    - If spending_group top contributor → use spending guard described earlier (prefer Abstain unless p_lower ≥ 0.70 or secondary rule p_lower ≥ 0.62 and n_effective_spend ≥ 8)
    - Non-group-dominant: Predict True if support_pos > support_neg AND (support_pos ≥ support_pos_min (0.06) OR reliable_pos_count ≥ 2) AND p_lower ≥ 0.55; Predict False symmetrically; else Abstain
- Calibration step:
  - After logit_final compute p_calibrated via Platt scale fit on historical LOO/validation set → produce p_final, p_lower, p_upper.

Validation & experiments to run immediately
- LOO evaluation on current labeled set using v2.0 scoring (no retrain of base_weights yet). Report: Brier, calibration (ECE), accuracy, recall, precision, abstain fraction, per-age bucket confusion matrix, per-spending-profile confusion matrix. Confirm corrections for 0026_01, 0031_01 and 0031_02.
- Threshold sweep:
  - p_lower_pos_threshold ∈ {0.50, 0.55, 0.60}
  - child_override_primary_p ∈ {0.60, 0.62, 0.65}
  - dominance_top_share_threshold ∈ {0.35, 0.45, 0.55}
- Min_bin_count sweep: {5, 10, 20}; spending_bins ∈ {10, 20, 30}
- Calibration experiments: fit Platt & isotonic; compute ECE overall and by Age bucket and SpendingGroup.
- Coverage CI bootstrap: verify se_logit_final and p_lower produce correct nominal coverage for 90% CI across segments.
- Focused stratified cross-tabs: Transported rate conditional on (Age_bucket × Cabin_deck) and (TotalSpend_bin × Destination).

Monitoring & alerts (what to compute and thresholds)
- Persist per-prediction: p_final, p_calibrated, p_lower, p_upper, se_logit_final, support_pos/neg/abs_total, reliable_pos/neg_count, top contributors, top_contrib_share, spending_group_signed_contrib, spending_group_se, multi_spend_extreme_count, spending_bin_id(s), age_bucket_id, child_flag, all_spend_zero, pooled_bin_source, snapshot_id, calibration_version.
- Dashboards:
  - Per-age-bucket FPR/FNR, CI coverage, ECE
  - Fraction of all_spend_zero by Age bucket
  - Batch abundance of child_flag and the child_override accept/abstain distribution
  - Distribution of p_lower and se_logit_final
  - Spending-group dominance fraction; if >1% → pause auto-commit and sample K for human review
- Triggers:
  - Pause commits if batch_age_distribution shifts by factor > 2 (KS or chi-square)
  - Alert if per-age-bucket FNR increases > X% vs baseline
  - Refit base_weights after +50 labels or if per-bin FPR/FNR drift beyond control limits

Rollout checklist (prioritized)
Immediate (24–48 h)
1. Implement Age bucketization + hierarchical pooling; ensure infant (0–3) bucket available with pooled counts.
2. Add child_flag, all_spend_zero logic and child_override pathway described above.
3. Keep spending-group fixes (aggregate, covariance) and add all_spend_zero guard to avoid negative bias from absence of spend.
4. Add calibration (Platt) pipeline and persist calibration_version.
5. Add per-prediction diagnostics (age_bucket_id, child_flag, pooled_bin_source, all_spend_zero) and batch alerts for Age/spend shifts.
Near-term (1–2 weeks)
1. Run validation experiments and tune thresholds (child_override, p_lower thresholds).
2. Set up dashboards for Age-bucket coverage & CI coverage; create audit queue for Abstain + child cases.
3. Refit base_weights with regularization if enough labels (+50) and check impact.
Medium-term (after +50 labels)
1. Implement hierarchical Bayesian pooling across spending bins and Age buckets.
2. Build a small segment GLM fallback for low-support segments.
3. Explore interactions (TotalSpend × Destination, Age × Cabin) as explicit features.
Long-term (100+ labels)
1. Move to a small calibrated supervised model (regularized logistic/GLM) that encodes these aggregations and still provides uncertainty via bootstrap or Bayesian approximation.

Case‑level diagnosis & expected outcomes (how v2.0 would handle problematic cases)
- 0031_01 (previous FN: high multi-channel spend): spending_group aggregator + n_effective ensures combined evidence is recognized; covariance and se propagation reduce overconfidence but group_reliability boosts weight; rule allows Predict True if p_lower ≥0.62 and n_eff ≥8 or p_lower ≥0.70 for extreme. Expected correction → Predict True or at worst Abstain.
- 0026_01 (previous FP: over‑confident small-n spend): extra_variance for spending extremes + dominance guard + prefer Abstain unless high p_lower reduces FP risk. Expected correction → Abstain or False rather than overconfident True.
- 0031_02 (current batch error: Age=2, spends=0): Age bucket (0–3) has pooled counts; Age weight increased and child_multiplier applies. all_spend_zero guard routes to segment_prior; if segment evidence supports Transported (likely given label), child_override will Predict True or at minimum raise p_lower so outcome is not a False. Expected correction → Predict True (or Abstain if extreme low support), reducing FN.

Expected tradeoffs
- Recall improvements for child and pooled segments; initial rise in Abstain rate as pipeline prefers safe Abstain for ambiguous group-dominant cases.
- Possible small increase in FP in child bucket if thresholds are loosened too much — validate and tune on LOO.
- Operational overhead: more auditing for Abstains and batch pre‑commit pauses until calibration stabilizes.

Short actionable checklist (deploy these first)
1. Add Age buckets (0–3, 4–12, 13–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+) with deterministic pooling rules.
2. Add child_flag and all_spend_zero detection; implement child_override_pathway described above.
3. Keep spending_group aggregator (n_effective and covariance) and ensure it does not suppress child logic.
4. Add Platt calibration on logit_final and persist calibration_version.
5. Add batch pre‑commit checks for Age distribution shifts and alert for spending_group_dominant fraction >1%.

How we’ll measure success (KPI)
- Primary: Reduction in FN for Age ≤ 3 group (target: >50% reduction on historical errors) and correction of cases like 0031_02.
- Secondary: overall Brier score improvement, improved ECE (≤ 0.03 target), LOO accuracy/recall improvement, controlled abstain rate (initially up to +5% acceptable), per-bin FPR/FNR for key bins stabilized.
- Refit base_weights when +50 labels show persistent drift in per-feature contributions.

Would you like:
- A) the concrete Python scoring function (deterministic) implementing v2.0 (including Age pooling, child_override and spending-group aggregation), or
- B) an immediate LOO evaluation of v2.0 on your labeled set (reports: Brier, accuracy, abstain stats, per-age confusion matrices and whether 0026_01 / 0031_01 / 0031_02 are corrected), or
- C) both (I can deliver the scorer and run LOO)?

Recommendation: run B (LOO) first so we can tune child_override and p_lower thresholds on real labels; I can produce A in parallel so you can test in staging quickly.
