PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 173
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)

- What happened (short)
  - Single‑record batch FP (Passenger 0213_01): model predicted transport=True driven by large channel spends (RoomService 367, FoodCourt 281, VRDeck 146; sum ≈ 794). Global sum threshold (IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD=1000) did not trigger. Calibrator returned over‑narrow uncertainty for this n==1 record → overconfident FP.
  - This is the same brittle small‑batch failure class seen before (0210_01, 0211_03, 0212_01, 0212_02) but with a variant: multi‑channel elevated spends (multi‑channel outlier) rather than a single extreme channel. Both variants share: n==1, channel‑level outlier behavior, insufficient channel‑aware detection, under‑estimated uncertainty.

- Top immediate priorities
  1. Emergency gating hotfix: treat n==1 records with either single‑channel extreme OR multi‑channel extreme as fragile; route to priority_audit unless strict concordance tests pass.
  2. Add channel‑aware detectors: per‑channel percentile/z‑score flags plus a multi_channel_outlier_flag (count of channels above channel_pctile).
  3. Increase heteroskedastic uncertainty and require GLM_fallback + ensemble agreement for n==1 fragiles; add per_feature logit caps/dominance dampening.
  4. Persist raw per‑channel spends with NaNs preserved and imputation provenance for canaries and all fragile records.

Concise answers to the six operational questions (batch accuracy focus)

1) Which specific patterns caused the error?
   - Multiple elevated channel spends (RoomService + FoodCourt + VRDeck) added up to a strong positive logit. Global sum threshold missed it. The calibrator did not include topN/channel‑outlier signals and returned over‑narrow quantiles for this single record → model appeared overly certain.

2) How should decision rules be modified?
   - Add channel‑aware top1/top2/topN percentile/zscore detectors and a multi_channel_outlier_flag (e.g., ≥ 2 channels ≥ 95th percentile).
   - For n==1 records that are fragile (single or multi‑channel outlier, missing demographics, imputed values): block auto decisions unless all of: GLM_fallback agrees (|p_model − p_glm| ≤ δ), ensemble_agreement high, pooled_prior_tau high & slice N large, and se_combined small & narrow quantile width.
   - Apply per_feature logit caps and dominance dampening when any topN flags trigger.

3) New transport‑pattern insights?
   - Elevated spending patterns can appear as either:
     - Single‑channel dominance (a single large channel value), or
     - Multi‑channel elevation (several channels simultaneously high).
   - Both variants are brittle for n==1 because relative channel percentiles and co‑occurrence matter; absolute total spend thresholds miss many such cases.

4) How should confidence be recalibrated?
   - Make the calibrator heteroskedastic and feed it channel‑level outlier signals (top1/top2/topN percentiles, multi_channel_count, channel_entropy, missingness_signature). Apply SE floors for n==1 fragiles and widen p10/p90 accordingly.

5) What adjustments are needed for batch consistency?
   - Compute batch_frac_fragile and, if above a small threshold (start 5%), hold the entire batch for review.
   - Enforce stricter gating for n==1 and for batches with many fragile records.

6) How can metrics be improved for edge cases like this?
   - Preserve pre‑imputation NaNs and imputation provenance.
   - Add per‑channel percentile/zscore detection and multi‑channel detectors.
   - Add per_feature logit caps, topK logit sum caps, dominance dampening; heteroskedastic calibrator; GLM_fallback; cluster‑aware priors for brittle slices.

Complete updated predictive metrics report — actionable components (optimized for batch prediction accuracy)

A. Immediate emergency actions (0–6h)
- Emergency gating hotfix:
  - If n_batch == 1 AND (single_channel_dominant_flag OR multi_channel_outlier_flag OR cryo_allzero_flag OR missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag OR imputed_count ≥ 1 OR novelty_high_flag) → block auto decision, route to priority_audit.
  - Add recent canaries (0210_01, 0211_03, 0212_01, 0212_02, 0213_01) to canary hold list.
  - For records with any per_channel_implausible_flag or topN flags: downweight logits (×0.5–0.75) and inflate variance.
- Persist provenance for all canaries and fragiles: raw per‑channel spends (NaNs), imputation provenance, and per_feature_logit_contributions.
- SE floors (emergency): n==1 & fragile_topN → se_floor = 0.65–0.75 (start 0.70).

B. Flag & feature definitions (compute pre‑imputation where possible)
- top1_channel, top1_value_raw, top1_share_raw = top1_value_raw / (sum_raw + ε).
- top2_channel, top2_value_raw, top2_share_raw; top3 likewise.
- single_channel_dominant_flag: top1_share_raw ≥ SHARE_DOMINANT (start 0.6).
- high_top1_abs_flag: top1_value_raw ≥ TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS (start 700; sweepable).
- top1_channel_pctile_flag: top1_value_raw ≥ channel_pctile(channel, PCTILE_TOP1_FLAG; start 99.0).
- top1_channel_zscore_flag: (top1_value_raw − channel_mean)/channel_std ≥ Z_TOP1_FLAG (start 3.0).
- multi_channel_outlier_flag: count(channels with value ≥ channel_pctile(channel, PCTILE_MULTI_FLAG)) ≥ MULTI_CHANNEL_COUNT_MIN (start PCTILE_MULTI_FLAG=95.0, MULTI_CHANNEL_COUNT_MIN=2).
- per_channel_implausible_flag[channel]: channel_raw ≥ channel_implausible_threshold[channel] OR channel_raw > 3×channel_99.9pct.
- channel_entropy = −Σ p_i log p_i for channel spend shares p_i.
- missingness_signature: bitmask/hash of missing demographics/channels.

C. Feature engineering updates (v→v+1)
- Persist raw spends and imputation provenance; compute flags pre‑imputation.
- New features:
  - top1_channel_pctile, top1_channel_zscore, top2_channel_pctile, multi_channel_count.
  - top1_top2_ratio, channel_entropy, topN_share_sum (sum of top3 shares).
  - winsorized_spend[channel] at per‑channel caps (channel_99.5pct).
  - per_feature_logit_contribution_raw and corrected (after caps/dampening).
- Keep raw channels for debugging/clustering.

D. Channel‑aware thresholds & caps
- Replace global-only implausible logic with per‑channel percentiles.
- Starting sweepable policies:
  - PCTILE_TOP1_FLAG = 99.0 (single‑channel extreme)
  - PCTILE_MULTI_FLAG = 95.0 and MULTI_CHANNEL_COUNT_MIN = 2 (multi‑channel pattern)
  - Z_TOP1_FLAG = 3.0
  - TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS = 700 (global guard; consider lowering if operationally acceptable)
  - per‑channel caps: winsorize at min(channel_99.5pct, absolute_cap[channel]).

E. Per‑feature logit caps & dominance dampening (channel‑aware)
- Enforce per_feature_logit_cap before summing logits:
  - CAP_PER_CHANNEL_LOGIT base = 1.0 (sweepable)
  - Channel specific caps for brittle channels (e.g., CAP_ROOM_SERVICE_LOGIT, CAP_VRDECK_LOGIT).
- Dominance dampening:
  - If single_channel_dominant_flag or top1_channel_pctile_flag: top1_value := α_dom_channel * top1_value (α_dom default 0.5–0.7; α_dom_roomservice = 0.6).
  - If multi_channel_outlier_flag: apply global scale β_multi (β_multi start 0.6) to the topK spends or to the sum of topK logit contributions.
  - Add a "logit_topK_sum_cap": cap the sum of top3 per_feature_logits to LOGIT_TOPK_CAP (start 1.6).
- Log which caps/ dampening were triggered for auditability.

F. Variance / SE model enhancements (heteroskedastic)
- Introduce variance components for counts of topN flags and multi_channel_count:
  - var_combined = var_base + κ_top1_high*I(top1_high) + κ_multi_high*multi_channel_count
  - Example κ_top1_high_base = 0.50; κ_multi_high = 0.45 per extra high channel.
- se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, se_floor(context)^2)).
- SE floors:
  - n==1 & fragile_topN or multi_channel_outlier → se_floor = 0.70.

G. Decision‑gating (pattern‑aware + batch/cohort aware)
- fragile_flag_v4 = union of cryo_allzero_flag, missing_homeplanet_flag, missing_destination_flag, single_channel_dominant_flag, multi_channel_outlier_flag, per_channel_implausible_flag, high_top1_abs_flag, any imputed_count ≥ 1, novelty_high_flag.
- batch_frac_fragile = #fragile_records_in_batch / batch_size.
  - If batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD (start 5%) → route entire batch to priority_audit.
- n==1 fragile gating (allow auto accept/reject only if ALL pass):
  - pooled_prior_tau ≥ τ_high_slice AND N_slice ≥ N_min_slice,
  - GLM_fallback_agrees (|p_model − p_glm| ≤ δ_slice),
  - ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high,
  - se_combined ≤ SE_accept_slice AND (p90 − p10) ≤ QW_accept_slice.
  - Otherwise route to priority_audit.

H. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan
- Calibrator:
  - Heteroskedastic quantile calibrator outputting p10/p50/p90 and variance head.
  - Inputs: raw_model_logit, per_feature_logit_contributions, fragility_flags, top1/top2/topN percentiles, multi_channel_count, channel_entropy, missingness_signature, winsorized_sum_spend.
  - Loss: quantile pinball (p10/p90), ECE regularizer, Brier for p50.
  - Upweight fragile and topN examples ×8–15 during training.
- GLM_fallback:
  - ElasticNet logistic on winsorized log1p channel features + key interactions (top1_channel×top1_value, multi_channel_count×cabin_deck, missingness_signature).
  - GLM used as interpretable concordance check before auto decisions.
- Training & deployment:
  - Rolling window (18–36 months), CV stratified by fragile slices and topN_channel groups.
  - Shadow run 14–28 days for threshold tuning before hard gating changes.

I. Mixture priors & cluster detection (topN stratified)
- For brittle slices (top1_high, multi_channel_high, cryo_allzero, all_zero), cluster on (demographics, raw_spend_vector, missingness_signature, cabin_deck).
- Compute cluster priors μ_cluster, N_cluster; blend priors by cluster membership probability to avoid pooling across heterogeneous cohorts.

J. Monitoring, metrics & alerts (batch‑focused)
- New slice KPIs:
  - top1_channel_FP_rate & FN_rate per channel
  - multi_channel_outlier_FP_rate & FN_rate
  - n==1_auto_accept_rate, n==1_fragile_auto_accept_rate
  - batch_frac_fragile, batch_hold_rate
- Alerts:
  - Any canary auto_accepted/rejected → immediate page.
  - topN_FP rise > baseline + X% over 24h → page.
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold → hold batch + page.
- Dashboards:
  - Per‑record provenance for canaries and fragiles (raw vs winsorized, per_feature_logits, calibrator outputs, gating_decision).

K. CI unit tests & validation (fragile & topN)
- Unit tests:
  - Pre‑imputation flags computed correctly.
  - top1_channel_pctile_flag and multi_channel_outlier_flag trigger for synthetic values at channel percentiles.
  - se_combined respects se_floor for n==1 & topN cases.
  - Per_feature logit caps & dominance dampening enforced.
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold disables auto_decisions.
  - Canaries (include all listed) must not be auto_accepted/rejected while emergency gating active.
- Regression tests:
  - Global ECE / AUC / Brier degrade less than tolerances when gating enabled.
  - Slice-level FP_rate reductions for topN and multi_channel slices.

L. Operational actions & timeline (0–72h)
1) Immediate (0–6h)
   - Deploy emergency gating to block n==1 fragiles including multi_channel_outlier detection; hold canaries (include 0213_01).
   - Persist provenance for canaries and fragiles.
   - Expose per_feature_logits, caps_triggered, calibrator outputs in logs.
2) Short‑term (6–24h)
   - Implement channel_percentile & zscore detectors and multi_channel_count; lightweight GLM_fallback; compute batch_frac_fragile; instrument dashboards; collect labels for flagged cases.
   - Run initial shadow tests to estimate audit volume and tune thresholds.
3) Mid‑term (24–72h)
   - Retrain heteroskedastic quantile calibrator and GLM_fallback with upweighted fragile slices; run 14–28 day shadow run.
   - Implement channel‑specific caps & dominance dampening; deploy mixture priors for brittle slices.
   - Finalize thresholds balancing throughput vs safety.

M. Per‑record provenance to log (minimum)
- Raw per_channel spends (NaNs preserved) + per_channel_imputed_flags + imputation_method + source_date.
- Demographics raw + missing flags: CryoSleep, missing_homeplanet_flag, missing_destination_flag, Age, Age_bucket, cabin_deck.
- Transforms & flags: winsorized_spend[channel], top1/top2/top3_channel, top1_value_raw, top1_share_raw, top1_channel_pctile, top1_channel_zscore, multi_channel_count, channel_entropy, high_top1_abs_flag, per_channel_implausible_flags, single_channel_dominant_flag, missingness_signature, cluster_id.
- Model internals: per_feature_logit_contributions (raw & capped), per_feature_logit_caps_triggered, pooled_prior_snapshot_id, μ_slice/μ_cluster, τ_slice_blend.
- Variances: var_components, var_combined, se_combined.
- Decision meta: GLM_fallback_probs, GLM_fallback_agreement_flag, ensemble_probs, ensemble_agreement, p10/p50/p90, quantile_width, gating_reasons, routing_decision, scorer_version.

N. Initial hyperparameters (start values; sweepable)

- PCTILE_MULTI_FLAG = 95.0

- δ_slice (GLM disagreement tolerance) = 0.05
- A_high (ensemble agreement) = 0.995
- QW_accept_slice (quantile width) = 0.12

O. CI canaries & expected behavior
- Canary list: include 0210_01, 0211_03, 0212_01, 0212_02, 0213_01.
- Expected route: priority_audit while emergency gating active.
- CI asserts: canaries not auto_accepted/rejected; raw provenance preserved.

P. Gating pseudocode (pattern‑aware, batch focused)
- For each batch B:
  - Compute batch_frac_fragile = count(r in B where fragile_flag_v4)/|B|
  - If batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD:
      route all r in B -> priority_audit; continue
  - For each r in B:
      compute pre‑imputation flags, top1/top2/top3, multi_channel_count
      set fragile_flag_v4 = union of flags above
      If n_batch == 1 and fragile_flag_v4:
         If pooled_prior_tau ≥ τ_high_slice AND N_slice ≥ N_min_slice AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept_slice AND (p90 − p10) ≤ QW_accept_slice:
             allow auto_decision
         Else:
             route r -> priority_audit
         continue
      If per_channel_implausible_flag OR top1_channel_pctile_flag OR multi_channel_outlier_flag:
         apply dominance dampening and per_feature_logit_caps
         If GLM+ensemble concordant AND se_combined small → allow auto_decision
         Else route -> priority_audit
      If missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag:
         route r -> data_quality_review + priority_audit

Q. Specific diagnosis — Passenger 0213_01 (chain of failure & root cause)
- Raw spends: RoomService 367, FoodCourt 281, VRDeck 146 → sum ≈ 794.
- Failure chain:
  1) No multi_channel detector: two or more elevated channels (RoomService & FoodCourt) were not flagged because the system used mainly sum-based and single extreme detectors.
  2) Per_feature_logit contributions for multiple channels added up and pushed logit over decision boundary; no per_feature caps or topK logit cap applied.
  3) Calibrator lacked topN/multi_channel inputs, returned narrow p10/p90 for this n==1 record → low se_combined.
  4) Gating allowed auto decision for n==1; GLM_fallback was either absent or agreed (illusion of concordance).
- Immediate mitigation that would have prevented this FP:
  - multi_channel_outlier_flag (≥ 2 channels ≥ 95th percentile) would mark record fragile → n==1 routing to priority_audit OR require GLM+ensemble concordance.
  - Per_feature logit caps / topK sum cap or dampening would have reduced the combined logit.
  - Heteroskedastic calibrator with topN inputs would have widened uncertainty.

R. How these changes reduce batch errors (short)
- Channel percentile/zscore detection catches single‑channel and multi‑channel outliers that sum thresholds miss.
- Per‑feature logit caps and topK dampening limit individual or combined channel dominance.
- Heteroskedastic calibrator + SE floors produce conservative uncertainty for n==1 and topN_high cases, reducing overconfident auto decisions.
- GLM fallback + ensemble corroboration provide an interpretable concordance check and safety net.

S. Tradeoffs & operational notes
- Expect an initial increase in priority_audit volume (especially for multi_channel flags). Tune PCTILE_MULTI_FLAG vs throughput.
- Slight increase in latency and system complexity; tradeoff is fewer high‑impact FPs in small batches.
- Global metrics (AUC/Brier) may change slightly; prioritize slice‑level and batch accuracy improvements.

T. Next steps / recommended sequencing
- Immediate: Deploy emergency gating hotfix with multi_channel detection and add canaries to hold list. I can produce runnable gating code + unit tests now.
- Short term: Implement channel_percentile detectors, multi_channel_count features, GLM_fallback; instrument dashboards and collect labels for flagged records for retraining.
- Mid term: Retrain heteroskedastic calibrator with upweighted fragile examples; deploy per_feature logit caps/dominance dampening; run shadow run and tune thresholds.

Would you like me to:
- produce the emergency gating implementation now (runnable code + unit tests + CI patch) to immediately block canaries and n==1 fragiles (including 0213_01), or
- produce the full retraining pipeline specification (heteroskedastic quantile calibrator + GLM_fallback + mixture priors), sweep matrix, and shadow‑run dashboard spec for the 24–72h plan?

Recommendation: Push the hotfix gating immediately (multi_channel and top1 percentile/zscore detection + provenance persistence for canaries). Then run the calibrator + GLM_fallback retrain in shadow and iterate thresholds based on observed audit volume and slice FP/FN changes.

If you want, I will generate:
- the gating code and unit tests for immediate deployment, or
- the full retrain plan and hyperparameter sweep scripts for the calibrator/GLM in my next message.
