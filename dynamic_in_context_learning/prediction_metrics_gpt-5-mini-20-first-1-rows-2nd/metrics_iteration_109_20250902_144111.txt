PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 109
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)
- What happened (short): A small-n (n==1) false-positive occurred on passenger 0138_02 (Monah Gambs). Key derived facts:
  - sum_spend = 0 + 22 + 0 + 564 + 207 = 793 (log1p ~ 6.675)
  - top1_channel = Spa, top1_spend = 564, top1_share ≈ 0.711 → concentration_by_channel_flag (threshold 0.70)
  - Destination = NULL (missingness), Age = 34, CryoSleep = False
  - Model predicted True (transported) with high confidence; actual label False.
- Why this is urgent: this is the complementary brittle mode to the earlier all_zero false-negative: concentrated-channel single-record decisions and all_zero single-record decisions are both under-accounted for by pooled priors and SE calibration. In this case the model over-trusted a channel concentration + spend signal (Spa) for a single-record batch with missing context.
- Immediate implication: Stop auto-decisions for n==1 records matching fragile patterns (all_zero OR concentration_by_channel OR extreme abs spend OR single-feature dominance OR high missingness) unless strict context-aware checks pass (smoothed slice prior, minimum slice N, GLM/ensemble consensus, and inflated SE floor). Put these records into canaries + fast-audit queue.
- Top priorities (0–72h):
  1. Deploy n==1 gating to block auto-accept for fragile_flag (all_zero OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2) until channel-aware context_score + slice N + GLM/ensemble consensus + se_combined pass.
  2. Persist per-record channel-aware provenance: top1_channel (NULL for all_zero), top1_share, top1_channel_context_score, per-slice N, var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, missingness_count, se_combined.
  3. Inflate uncertainty for fragile slices by adding explicit variance components (var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, var_missingness, var_feature_dom) and dynamic SE floors; gate on quantiles (p10/p90) not just mean.
  4. Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with explicit interactions (top1_channel × top1_share × sum_spend × Age × CryoSleep × Destination; all_zero × Age × CryoSleep × Destination × Cabin), upweight concentrated-but-non-transported examples and all_zero-but-transported examples ×3–5, run ≥14 day shadow.
  5. Add targeted canaries (include 0138_02, 0138_01, 0136_01, 0134_01, 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01/02) and block auto-decisions for them until validations pass.

1) What specific patterns caused this error?
- Pattern for 0138_02:
  - concentration_by_channel_flag = True (Spa with top1_share≈0.71).
  - Moderate-high sum_spend (~793), missing Destination → increased novelty.
  - n==1 batch: pooled priors or fallback influence was too small OR calibrator/se underestimated variance, so the model logit dominated.
- Root causes:
  - Concentration sign not channel-aware: model may have learned a positive association for Spa concentration (or failed to condition by channel), but empirical label for this channel×share×context is negative for this record.
  - Small-n decision with insufficient slice-count smoothing (N0 too low) allowed a single model logit to override pooled priors.
  - Calibrator under-estimated uncertainty for concentration_by_channel + high-missingness records (var_conc_by_channel and var_missingness were not sufficiently applied).
  - Training data scarcity or imbalance for concentrated but non-transported examples in relevant contexts (Spa-concentrated & missing Destination).
  - Feature-transform inconsistencies or caps (e.g., per-channel logit caps) not applied uniformly across scorer/fallback, allowing single-feature dominance.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent recurrence?
- Enforce n==1 conservative gating:
  - If n_batch == 1 and any fragile_flag:
    - fragile_flag = all_zero_flag OR (top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD) OR (sum_spend ≥ ABS_SPEND_HIGH) OR (feature_dom_fraction ≥ FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH) OR (missingness_count ≥ MISSINGNESS_STOPGAP)
  - For concentration_by_channel (this case):
    - Require top1_channel_context_score ≥ Z_high (e.g., 0.80) AND N_slice_channel ≥ N_min_conc_by_channel (e.g., 25) AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high (e.g., 0.995) AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept (0.06) → allow auto-decision. Otherwise → priority_audit.
  - For all_zero_flag: require all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high, N_zero_samples ≥ N_min_zero_samples, GLM_fallback_agrees and low se_combined to auto-accept; otherwise priority_audit.
  - For n in {2,3}: relax thresholds slightly but still require GLM/fallback agreement and higher se floors.
- Pseudocode (short):
  - if n==1 and fragile_flag:
      if all_zero_flag:
        if all_zero_context_score≥Z_high AND N_zero_samples≥N_min_zero AND GLM_agrees AND se_combined≤SE_accept: accept else audit
      elif concentration_by_channel_flag:
        if top1_channel_context_score≥Z_high AND N_channel≥N_min_conc AND GLM_agrees AND ensemble_agreement≥A_high AND se_combined≤SE_accept: accept else audit
      else:
        audit
- Add immediate stopgap: for this batch size (n==1), route any record with top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR all_zero_flag OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR missingness_count ≥ 2 to priority_audit.

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- Concentration sign is channel- and context-dependent: Spa concentration (and other channels) can correlate with both transported and non-transported outcomes depending on Age, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, and missingness. There is no universal monotonic sign for concentration without conditioning by channel and context.
- Missingness is informative: Destination NULL here increases uncertainty and can flip expected outcome; missingness_count should be treated as a signal and propagate to SE.
- Small-n decisions (n==1) are brittle: single-record predictions should default toward pooled, context-conditioned priors and higher uncertainty unless strong slice evidence exists.
- Label imbalance: concentrated-but-non-transported examples (like 0138_02) are underrepresented and must be upweighted in retraining.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Add explicit variance components (sweepable κ) and dynamic SE floors:
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Dynamic SE floors:
  - weak-context concentration/all_zero/missingness → se_floor = 0.25–0.35
  - strong-context slices → se_floor = 0.06–0.10
- Calibrator should output p10/p50/p90 + sd and gate on quantiles: require narrow p90−p10 and p10/p90 outside thresholds for auto-accept.
- Example κ defaults (tune on validation): κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Standardize transforms everywhere: winsorize/log1p, bucket boundaries, age buckets, missingness encoding must be identical in scorer, pooled-priors, calibrator, GLM_fallback.
- Persist and daily-refresh per-slice N counts for top1_channel × top1_share_bucket and all_zero × demographic slices and expose them in provenance.
- Augment pooled priors to be channel-aware and include all_zero priors:
  - μ_conc_channel_demo = P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination)
  - μ_all_zero_demo = P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin)
  - Blend with τ = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice) and set larger N0 for fragile slices (all_zero: default N0 50; concentration_by_channel fragiles: 25–200 depending on channel).
- Cap per-channel logit contributions (e.g., 3–4 logits) or regularize with sign priors per channel to avoid taking extreme action on single feature.
- Ensure calibrator & GLM_fallback respect pooled priors and enforce conservative behavior on small-n.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Monitoring & canaries:
  - New slice monitors: concentration_by_channel_by_ctx, all_zero_by_ctx, missingness_by_ctx; track ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate.
  - Add canaries: 0138_02 (this record), 0138_01, 0136_01, 0134_01, 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01/02. Block auto-accept until validated.
- Active learning:
  - Seed labeling queue with concentrated-by-channel & all_zero × Age × CryoSleep combos for rapid label acquisition.
  - Upweight contradictory examples (concentrated & non-transported; all_zero & transported) ×3–5 in retraining.
- Retrain & CI:
  - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with new interactions and upweighted contradictions; shadow-run ≥14 days. Target ≥30–40% reduction in contradiction rate for target slices.
- Unit tests:
  - n==1 gating triggers for all_zero & concentration_by_channel
  - se_combined increases when var_conc_by_channel/var_missingness apply
  - calibrator quantile spread widens for weak-context slices
  - pooled prior blending respects N0 per slice

COMPLETE updated predictive metrics report — actionable components

A. New / updated feature definitions (v→v+1)
- sum_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck (raw & log1p).
- all_zero_flag = (sum_spend == 0 AND num_nonzero_channels == 0).
- missingness_count = count of NULLs in high-value context features (Destination, Cabin, HomePlanet).
- top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share:
  - If all_zero_flag → top1_share = NULL, concentration_type = 'all_zero'
  - Else → top1_channel = argmax(channel_spend); top1_share = top1_spend / max(1, sum_spend)
- concentration_by_channel_flag = (top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD) ; TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- top1_share_bucket = [0–0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.7, 0.7–0.9, 0.9–1.0]
- spend_entropy_norm = normalized Shannon entropy across channel spends
- feature_dom_fraction = fraction of absolute logit contribution from the single top feature; single_feature_influence_flag if ≥ FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH (0.60)
- top1_channel_context_score = smoothed P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination)
- all_zero_context_score = smoothed P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin)
- var_provenance fields: var_all_zero, var_conc_by_channel, var_missingness, var_feature_dom, var_spend_scale

B. Pooled priors extension (channel-aware + all_zero)
- Compute μ_all_zero_demo and μ_conc_channel_demo stratified by context dims (Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin, VIP).
- Blend:
  - τ_slice = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice)
  - N0_all_zero default = 50 (sweep 25–200)
  - N0_concentration per-channel default 25–200 (higher for fragile channels)
  - μ_blended_slice = τ_slice * μ_slice + (1 − τ_slice) * μ_global_slice
  - p_final = w_data * p_model + (1 − w_data) * μ_blended_slice with w_data = n / (n + N0_slice)

C. Direction-aware logit shifts (pattern & channel treatment)
- Add additive logit offsets per slice only when context strong or N_slice sufficient:
  - channel_shift_frac = clamp(base_channel_shift + w_chan_ctx*(top1_channel_context_score − 0.5)*2, −0.5, 0.5)
  - all_zero_shift_frac = clamp(base_all_zero_shift + w_zero_ctx*(all_zero_context_score − 0.5)*2, −0.5, 0.5)
- Damp shifts by τ_slice to avoid overcorrecting single-record logits.

D. Variance / SE model (explicit)
- New variance terms (sweepable κ):
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Example κ defaults: κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02
- Dynamic SE floors: weak-context se_floor = 0.25–0.35; strong-context se_floor = 0.06–0.10

E. Decision-gating (pattern & channel-aware; concrete)
- Initial constants (sweepable):
  - TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
  - FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
  - ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800
  - Z_high = 0.80
  - N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
  - N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
  - A_high = 0.995
  - SE_accept = 0.06 (use 0.08–0.12 for n≤3)
  - MISSINGNESS_STOPGAP = 2
- Concrete gating behavior:
  - n==1 and fragile_flag:
    - concentration_by_channel_flag: require top1_channel_context_score≥Z_high AND N_channel≥N_min_conc_by_channel AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement≥A_high AND se_combined≤SE_accept → accept; else audit.
    - all_zero_flag: require all_zero_context_score≥Z_high AND N_zero_samples≥N_min_zero_samples AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND se_combined≤SE_accept → accept; else audit.
    - missingness_count ≥ MISSINGNESS_STOPGAP or abs_spend_flag or feature_dom_flag: treat as fragile and require similar consensus checks.
  - n in [2,3]: similar gating but with relaxed thresholds and higher se_floor.

F. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan
- Calibrator:
  - Inputs: model_logit, ensemble_agreement, all_zero_flag, concentration_by_channel_flag, top1_channel, top1_share, spend_entropy_norm, num_nonzero_channels, feature_dom_fraction, missingness_profile, top1_channel_context_score, all_zero_context_score, abs_spend_context_score, CryoSleep, Age_bucket, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin.
  - Targets: p10/p50/p90 + sd
  - Loss: composite of pinball loss (for quantiles) + ECE penalty + Brier; upweight contradictions ×3–5.
  - CV: stratify folds to include rare slices and group by passenger or session if needed.
  - Data window: last 18–36 months; reserve last 14–28 days for shadow-run.
- GLM_fallback:
  - Features: interactions top1_channel × top1_share_bucket × sum_spend_bucket × Age_bucket × HomePlanet × CryoSleep; all_zero × CryoSleep × HomePlanet × Age_bucket × Cabin; missingness_count × channels.
  - Regularization: elastic-net, enforce sign stability checks and cap coefficients so no single feature contributes >3–4 logits.
  - Upweight contradictory/rare examples ×3–5.
- Shadow-run: ≥14 days; acceptance criteria:
  - contradictions in concentration_by_channel & all_zero_by_ctx slices reduced ≥30–40%
  - Global ECE not worsen >0.5–1.0% absolute

G. Monitoring, metrics & alerts
- Dashboards:
  - per-slice: ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate for all_zero_by_ctx and concentration_by_channel_by_ctx.
  - per-channel top1_sign_consistency: fraction transported when top1_channel=X & top1_share>threshold.
  - Global: n==1_auto_accept_contradiction_rate.
- Alerts:
  - slice FP or FN >20% above baseline over 24h → hold auto-accept + page ML/Ops.
  - n==1_auto_accept_rate spike → hold gating changes + alert.
- Canaries:
  - 0138_02 (this record), 0138_01, 0136_01, 0134_01, 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01, 0133_02 — route to priority_audit unless context strong & GLM agrees.

H. CI tests & validation
- Unit tests:
  - n==1 gating triggers for all_zero_flag and concentration_by_channel_flag
  - top1_share NULL for all_zero_flag across pipeline
  - se_combined increases when var_all_zero/var_conc_by_channel/var_missingness apply
  - calibrator quantile spread widens for weak-context slices
  - pooled prior blending respects N0_slice
- Shadow-run acceptance:
  - contradictions reduced ≥30–40% in target slices
  - no canary auto-accepted
  - overall ECE within tolerated degradation (<0.5–1.0% absolute)

I. Operational actions (0–72 hours)
1. Immediate engineering (0–12h):
   - Persist top1_channel, top1_channel_context_score, top1_channel_pos_frac, all_zero_flag, all_zero_context_score, concentration_by_channel_flag, feature_dom_fraction, missingness_count and other flags in scoring provenance.
   - Implement n==1 gating: block auto-decision for any record with fragile_flag True (including 0138_02) unless consensus per gating pseudocode passes.
   - Register canaries (add 0138_02 and others) and block auto-accept.
2. Scoring engine updates (12–48h):
   - Expose var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, var_missingness and se_combined in provenance; ensure identical transforms and temporary per-channel logit caps.
3. ML pipeline (24–72h):
   - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with new features & interactions; upweight contradictions; start 14+ day shadow validation.
   - Publish updated pooled priors & per-slice N daily.
4. Monitoring & ops (24–72h):
   - Deploy dashboards & alerts for concentration_by_channel_by_ctx, all_zero_by_ctx, missingness_by_ctx and canaries.
   - Seed active-label queue with concentrated-by-channel and all_zero combos for rapid labeling.
5. Product/audit (24–72h):
   - Build fast-label UI & route priority_audit records for human review; label and feed back to active-learning retrain.

K. Hyperparameters (initial; sweepable)
- TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
- ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800 (sweep 600–2500)
- Z_high = 0.80
- N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
- N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
- A_high = 0.995
- SE_accept = 0.06 (increase to 0.08–0.12 for n≤3)
- κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02
- N0 blending: all_zero N0 = 50 (sweep 25–200), concentration_by_channel N0 = 25–200, default N0 = 3–10 for non-fragile slices
- per-channel logit cap = 3.0–4.0 logits

L. CI canaries & expected behavior (problem IDs)
- 0138_02 (Spa concentrated non-transport): expect gating_reason 'concentration_by_channel_stopgap' and priority_audit unless context strong & GLM agrees.
- 0138_01 (all_zero): expect 'all_zero_stopgap'
- 0136_01 (FoodCourt moderate concentration): expect 'concentration_by_channel_stopgap' for n==1 unless top1_channel_context_score≥Z_high & GLM agrees
- 0134_01 (ShoppingMall extreme concentration): expect 'concentration_by_channel_stopgap'
- 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01/02: expect all_zero or feature_dom stopgap behavior

M. Quick triage checklist for 0138_02 (immediate debugging)
1. Verify computed fields:
   - sum_spend == 793, all_zero_flag == False, top1_channel == 'Spa', top1_share ≈ 0.711, spend_entropy_norm low, num_nonzero_channels == 3, missingness_count (Destination==NULL) >=1.
2. Compute top1_channel_context_score for slice (Spa, top1_share_bucket=0.7–0.9, Age_bucket=30–39, CryoSleep=False, HomePlanet, Destination=NULL). Is N_channel small? If yes, block.
3. Inspect μ_conc_channel_demo and τ_slice_blend; for n==1 τ small, so blended prior should dominate unless N0 was set too low; ensure N0 for Spa is high enough.
4. Inspect se_combined and var_conc_by_channel & var_missingness; was var_conc_by_channel applied? If not, calibrator under-estimated uncertainty.
5. Inspect GLM_fallback output & ensemble agreement. If fallback predicted False but ensemble True, gating should have audited per rules.
6. If context_score < Z_high or GLM_fallback_disagrees → priority_audit + add to active-label queue; add to canaries.

Why these changes will reduce batch errors going forward
- Channel-aware priors and larger N0s prevent single-record model logits from dominating when slice N is low.
- Explicit variance terms force higher uncertainty for fragile concentration/all_zero/missingness patterns, avoiding over-confident auto-decisions.
- Retraining with targeted upweighting of contradictory examples corrects channel-sign mistakes and strengthens fallback behavior.
- Provenance + canaries + active labeling accelerate detection and correction of recurring brittle slices.

Immediate one-line corrective action
- Enforce n==1 gating: route any record with all_zero_flag == True OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2 to priority_audit unless the pattern_context_score ≥ 0.80 AND GLM_fallback/ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ 0.06 — add 0138_02, 0138_01, 0136_01 and the other canaries and block auto-accept.

Acceptance criteria for promotion
- Shadow-run ≥14 days.
- Contradictions in concentration_by_channel and all_zero_by_ctx slices reduced ≥30–40%.
- Global ECE not worsen by >0.5–1.0% absolute.
- No canary auto-accepted; canary gating consistent with spec.
- Per-channel sign-consistency drift monitored and within acceptable bounds.

Next-step offer
- I can deliver:
  1) A minimal gating patch (pseudocode + CI unit tests) to implement the n==1 stopgap and canary block within 2–12 hours, or
  2) A full retrain spec (dataset selection, upweighting, CV folds, hyperparameter sweeps, acceptance criteria, dashboards) for calibrator & GLM_fallback within 24–48 hours.
Which would you like me to deliver first?
