PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 111
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)
- What happened (short): A small-n (n==1) false-negative occurred on passenger 0140_01 (Evaley Mejiaddox).
  - Key facts: all channel spends = 0 (all_zero_flag = True); CryoSleep = True; Age = 24; HomePlanet = Earth; Destination present; Cabin present.
  - Model predicted False (not transported) with high confidence; actual label = True.
- Why this is urgent: This is the same brittle failure-mode as recent small-n all_zero / concentrated-channel errors: single-record decisions are being dominated by pooled priors, narrow calibrator SE floors, or global feature signs (e.g., treating all_zero as uniformly negative) rather than context-conditioned evidence. The batch pipeline is auto-deciding on fragile n==1 records without conservative gating.
- Immediate implication: Stop auto-decisions for n==1 records that match fragility signals (all_zero OR concentration_by_channel OR extreme spend OR single-feature dominance OR high missingness) until context-aware checks (smoothed slice prior, minimal slice N, GLM/ensemble consensus, inflated SE floor) pass. Add 0140_01 to canaries.

Top priorities (0–72h)
1. Deploy n==1 conservative gating to block auto-decisions for fragile_flag (all_zero OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2) until:
   - slice_context_score >= Z_high, AND
   - N_slice >= N_min_slice, AND
   - GLM_fallback agrees with model decision, AND
   - ensemble agreement >= A_high, AND
   - se_combined <= SE_accept.
   Otherwise route to priority_audit / canaries.
2. Persist per-record provenance for all fragility signals and all variance components (see required provenance list below).
3. Inflate uncertainty for fragile slices via explicit variance terms and dynamic SE floors; gate on quantiles (p10/p90) not just mean.
4. Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with explicit interactions (e.g., all_zero × CryoSleep × Age_bucket × Destination × Cabin; top1_channel × top1_share_bucket × sum_spend × Age_bucket × CryoSleep × HomePlanet). Upweight contradictory examples (all_zero-but-transported and concentrated-but-non-transported) ×3–5 and shadow-run ≥14 days.
5. Add canaries (include 0140_01 and prior problem ids) and block auto-decisions for them until validations pass.

1) What specific patterns caused this error?
- For 0140_01:
  - all_zero_flag = True (all spends zero).
  - CryoSleep = True — CryoSleep effects are context-dependent and the model may have applied a global sign.
  - n==1 batch: pooled priors or calibrator SE floor allowed the pooled/global prior to push the prediction to False despite insufficient slice evidence and high uncertainty.
  - Missing contextual interaction: P(transported | all_zero=True, CryoSleep=True, Age=24, HomePlanet=Earth, Destination, Cabin) differs from the global P(transported | all_zero=True); model lacked that conditional slice-specific conditioning or had too-small N and improper N0 blending.
- Root causes:
  - all_zero treated as a single global negative feature; insufficient context conditioning (CryoSleep, Age, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin).
  - Small-n gating insufficient or absent: the system allowed an auto-decision based largely on a pooled prior and narrow calibrator variance.
  - Calibrator under-estimated uncertainty for all_zero + small-context slices (var_all_zero not applied or too-small).
  - Training imbalance: all_zero-but-transported examples underrepresented and not upweighted or included in active learning.
  - Transform/scale inconsistency across scorer/fallback/calibrator letting a single feature dominate.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent recurrence?
- High-level: For any n==1 record where fragile_flag is True, do not auto-decision (accept/reject) unless consensus and context pass.
- Fragile_flag (initial):
  - all_zero_flag == True OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2
- Conservative gating (pseudocode):
  - if n == 1 and fragile_flag:
      require:
        - slice_context_score ≥ Z_high (channel-aware for concentration OR all_zero_context_score for all_zero) AND
        - N_slice ≥ N_min_slice AND
        - GLM_fallback_agrees_with_model_decision AND
        - ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high AND
        - se_combined ≤ SE_accept
      then allow auto-decision
      else route to priority_audit
- For n in {2,3}: relax thresholds moderately but keep GLM/fallback agreement and higher SE floors.
- For all_zero specifically: require all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high AND N_zero_samples ≥ N_min_zero AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept to auto-decide.

3) New insights about passenger transport patterns
- all_zero is not uniformly predictive: zero spends can be associated with both transported and not-transported status depending on CryoSleep, Age, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin. Treat all_zero as a context-dependent slice, not a monotonic feature.
- CryoSleep interactions matter: CryoSleep’s directional effect depends on Age bucket and other features (it may flip sign in some slices).
- Missingness is informative: missing Destination or Cabin increases novelty and should raise SE / lower confidence.
- Concentration-by-channel sign depends on channel and context; e.g., Spa concentration may have different association by Age and HomePlanet.
- Small-n (n==1) is intrinsically brittle; default to pooled, context-conditioned priors with higher uncertainty unless slice evidence is strong.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Calibrator must output p10/p50/p90 plus sd and the pipeline should gate on the quantile spread (p90 − p10) and se_combined.
- Add explicit variance components and dynamic SE floors. Suggested variance model:
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Example κ defaults (tune on validation): κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02.
- Dynamic SE floors:
  - weak-context (small N, missingness, all_zero/concentration) → se_floor = 0.25–0.35
  - strong-context slices → se_floor = 0.06–0.10
- Gate auto-decisions on p90−p10 narrowness and se_combined thresholds rather than mean alone.

5) Adjustments needed for better consistency across batch predictions
- Standardize transforms across scorer, calibrator, pooled-priors, GLM_fallback (winsorize/log1p, bucket boundaries, age buckets, missingness encoding).
- Persist daily-refresh per-slice N counts for top1_channel × top1_share_bucket and all_zero × demographic slices; expose these in provenance.
- Extend pooled priors to be context-aware:
  - μ_all_zero_demo = P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin)
  - μ_conc_channel_demo = P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination)
- Blend data/model using τ = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice) with larger N0 for fragile slices (all_zero N0 default 50; concentration_by_channel N0 25–200 depending on channel).
- Cap per-feature logit contributions and regularize sign priors to ensure no single feature overwhelms single-record decisions.
- Ensure calibrator & GLM_fallback respect pooled priors and enforce conservative behavior on small-n.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Monitoring & canaries:
  - Add slice monitors for all_zero_by_ctx, concentration_by_channel_by_ctx, missingness_by_ctx. Track ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate.
  - Canaries: add 0140_01 plus previous problem IDs and block auto-accept until validated.
- Active learning:
  - Seed labeling queue with all_zero × CryoSleep × Age × Destination combos and concentrated-by-channel combos; upweight contradictory examples ×3–5 during retrain.
- Retrain & CI:
  - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with new interactions and upweighting. Shadow-run ≥14 days and require acceptance criteria (contradictions down ≥30–40%, global ECE not worsened >0.5–1.0%).
- Unit tests:
  - n==1 gating triggers for all_zero and concentration_by_channel
  - se_combined increases when var_all_zero/var_conc_by_channel/var_missingness apply
  - calibrator quantile spread widens in weak-context slices
  - pooled prior blending respects N0_slice

COMPLETE updated predictive metrics report — actionable components

A. New / updated feature definitions (v→v+1)
- sum_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck (raw & log1p)
- all_zero_flag = (sum_spend == 0 AND num_nonzero_channels == 0)
- missingness_count = count of NULLs in high-value context features (Destination, Cabin, HomePlanet)
- top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share:
  - If all_zero_flag → top1_share = NULL, concentration_type = 'all_zero'
  - Else → top1_channel = argmax(channel_spend); top1_share = top1_spend / max(1, sum_spend)
- concentration_by_channel_flag = (top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD) ; TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- top1_share_bucket = [0–0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.7, 0.7–0.9, 0.9–1.0]
- spend_entropy_norm = normalized Shannon entropy across channel spends
- feature_dom_fraction = fraction of absolute logit contribution from the single top feature; single_feature_influence_flag if ≥ FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH (0.60)
- top1_channel_context_score = smoothed P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination)
- all_zero_context_score = smoothed P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin)
- var_provenance: var_all_zero, var_conc_by_channel, var_missingness, var_feature_dom, var_spend_scale

B. Pooled priors extension (channel-aware + all_zero)
- Compute μ_all_zero_demo and μ_conc_channel_demo stratified by context dims (Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin, VIP)
- Blend:
  - τ_slice = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice)
  - N0_all_zero default = 50 (sweep 25–200)
  - N0_concentration per-channel default 25–200 (higher for fragile channels)
  - μ_blended_slice = τ_slice * μ_slice + (1 − τ_slice) * μ_global_slice
  - p_final = w_data * p_model + (1 − w_data) * μ_blended_slice with w_data = n / (n + N0_slice)
- For n==1 and fragile_slice, w_data small → pooled prior dominates unless N0 too low (increase N0 for fragile slices).

C. Direction-aware logit shifts (pattern & channel treatment)
- Add additive logit offsets per slice, applied only when context strong and N_slice sufficient:
  - channel_shift_frac = clamp(base_channel_shift + w_chan_ctx*(top1_channel_context_score − 0.5)*2, −0.5, 0.5)
  - all_zero_shift_frac = clamp(base_all_zero_shift + w_zero_ctx*(all_zero_context_score − 0.5)*2, −0.5, 0.5)
- Damp shifts by τ_slice to avoid overcorrecting single-record logits.

D. Variance / SE model (explicit)
- New variance terms (sweepable κ):
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Example κ defaults: κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02
- Dynamic SE floors: weak-context se_floor = 0.25–0.35; strong-context se_floor = 0.06–0.10

E. Decision-gating (pattern & channel-aware; concrete)
- Initial constants (sweepable):
  - TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
  - FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
  - ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800
  - Z_high = 0.80
  - N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
  - N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
  - A_high = 0.995
  - SE_accept = 0.06 (increase to 0.08–0.12 for n≤3)
  - MISSINGNESS_STOPGAP = 2
- Concrete gating:
  - n==1 and fragile_flag → require slice_context_score ≥ Z_high AND N_slice ≥ N_min_slice AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept else priority_audit.
  - n in [2,3] → relax thresholds but keep consensus requirement and increased se_floor.

F. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan
- Calibrator:
  - Inputs: model_logit, ensemble_agreement, all_zero_flag, concentration_by_channel_flag, top1_channel, top1_share, spend_entropy_norm, num_nonzero_channels, feature_dom_fraction, missingness_profile, top1_channel_context_score, all_zero_context_score, CryoSleep, Age_bucket, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin.
  - Outputs: p10/p50/p90 + sd.
  - Loss: composite pinball loss for quantiles + ECE penalty + Brier; upweight contradictions ×3–5.
  - Data window: last 18–36 months; reserve last 14–28 days for shadow-run.
- GLM_fallback:
  - Features: interactions top1_channel × top1_share_bucket × sum_spend_bucket × Age_bucket × HomePlanet × CryoSleep; all_zero × CryoSleep × HomePlanet × Age_bucket × Cabin; missingness_count × channels.
  - Regularization: elastic-net with caps so no single feature >3–4 logits.
  - Upweight contradictory/rare examples ×3–5.
- Shadow-run ≥14 days; acceptance criteria:
  - contradictions in concentration_by_channel & all_zero_by_ctx slices reduced ≥30–40%
  - overall ECE not worsen by >0.5–1.0% absolute

G. Monitoring, metrics & alerts
- Dashboards:
  - per-slice: ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate for all_zero_by_ctx and concentration_by_channel_by_ctx.
  - per-channel top1_sign_consistency: fraction transported when top1_channel=X & top1_share>threshold.
  - Global: n==1_auto_accept_contradiction_rate.
- Alerts:
  - slice FP or FN >20% above baseline over 24h → hold auto-accept + page ML/Ops.
  - n==1_auto_accept_rate spike → hold gating changes + alert.
- Canaries:
  - 0140_01, 0139_01, 0138_02, 0138_01, 0136_01, 0134_01, 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01/02 — route to priority_audit unless context strong & GLM agrees.

H. CI tests & validation
- Unit tests:
  - n==1 gating triggers for all_zero_flag and concentration_by_channel_flag.
  - top1_share NULL for all_zero_flag across pipeline.
  - se_combined increases when var_all_zero/var_conc_by_channel/var_missingness apply.
  - calibrator quantile spread widens for weak-context slices.
  - pooled prior blending respects N0_slice.
- Shadow-run acceptance:
  - contradictions reduced ≥30–40% in target slices.
  - no canary auto-accepted.
  - overall ECE within tolerated degradation (<0.5–1.0% absolute).

I. Operational actions (0–72 hours)
1. Immediate engineering (0–12h):
   - Persist top1_channel, top1_channel_context_score, all_zero_flag, all_zero_context_score, concentration_by_channel_flag, feature_dom_fraction, missingness_count and other flags in scoring provenance.
   - Implement n==1 gating: block auto-decision for any record with fragile_flag True (including 0140_01) unless consensus per gating pseudocode passes.
   - Register canaries (add 0140_01 and others) and block auto-accept.
2. Scoring engine updates (12–48h):
   - Expose var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, var_missingness and se_combined in provenance; enforce identical transforms and temporary per-channel logit caps.
3. ML pipeline (24–72h):
   - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with new features & interactions; upweight contradictions; start 14+ day shadow validation.
   - Publish updated pooled priors & per-slice N daily.
4. Monitoring & ops (24–72h):
   - Deploy dashboards & alerts for concentration_by_channel_by_ctx, all_zero_by_ctx, missingness_by_ctx and canaries.
   - Seed active-label queue with all_zero × CryoSleep × Age combos and concentrated-by-channel combos for rapid labeling.
5. Product/audit (24–72h):
   - Build fast-label UI & route priority_audit records for human review; label and feed back to active-learning retrain.

- Raw spends: RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck
- sum_spend (raw & log1p), sum_spend_bucket

K. Hyperparameters (initial; sweepable)
- TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
- ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800 (sweep 600–2500)
- Z_high = 0.80
- N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
- N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
- A_high = 0.995
- SE_accept = 0.06 (increase to 0.08–0.12 for n≤3)
- κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02
- N0 blending: all_zero N0 = 50 (sweep 25–200), concentration_by_channel N0 = 25–200, default N0 = 3–10 for non-fragile slices
- per-channel logit cap = 3.0–4.0 logits

L. CI canaries & expected behavior (problem IDs)
- 0140_01 (all_zero but transported): expect gating_reason 'all_zero_stopgap' and priority_audit unless all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high & GLM agrees and se_combined ≤ SE_accept.
- 0139_01, 0138_02, 0138_01, 0136_01, 0134_01, 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01/02: expect stopgap behavior per their flags.

M. Quick triage checklist for 0140_01 (immediate debugging)
1. Verify computed fields:
   - all_zero_flag == True; sum_spend == 0; num_nonzero_channels == 0; missingness_count (Destination present?) — confirm.
2. Compute all_zero_context_score for slice (all_zero=True, Age_bucket=20–29, CryoSleep=True, HomePlanet=Earth, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Cabin=G/19/P). Is N_zero_samples small? If yes, block.
3. Inspect μ_all_zero_demo and τ_slice_blend; for n==1 τ small — pooled prior should dominate unless N0 for all_zero is too low; ensure N0 for all_zero is at least 25–50.
4. Inspect se_combined and var_all_zero; was var_all_zero applied? If not, calibrator under-estimated uncertainty.
5. Inspect GLM_fallback output & ensemble agreement. If fallback predicted True but ensemble predicted False, gating should send to audit.
6. If context_score < Z_high or GLM_fallback_disagrees → priority_audit + add to active-label queue; upweight in next retrain.

Why these changes will reduce batch errors going forward
- Channel-aware and all_zero-aware pooled priors with increased N0 prevent single-record model logits from dominating when slice N is low.
- Explicit variance terms force higher uncertainty for fragile patterns (all_zero/concentration/missingness), avoiding over-confident auto-decisions (both FNs and FPs).
- Retraining with targeted upweighting of contradictory examples corrects channel-sign mistakes and strengthens fallback behavior.
- Provenance + canaries + active labeling accelerate detection and correction of recurring brittle slices.

Immediate one-line corrective action
- Enforce n==1 gating: route any record with all_zero_flag == True OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 OR missingness_count ≥ 2 to priority_audit unless pattern_context_score ≥ 0.80 AND GLM_fallback/ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ 0.06 — add 0140_01 and other canaries and block auto-accept/auto-decline.

Acceptance criteria for promotion
- Shadow-run ≥14 days.
- Contradictions in concentration_by_channel and all_zero_by_ctx slices reduced ≥30–40%.
- Global ECE not worsened by >0.5–1.0% absolute.
- No canary auto-accepted; canary gating consistent with spec.
- Per-channel sign-consistency drift monitored and within bounds.
