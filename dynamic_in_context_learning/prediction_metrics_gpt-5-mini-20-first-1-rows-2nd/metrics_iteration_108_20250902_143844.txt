PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 108
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)
- What happened (short): The batch contained two small-n brittle failures that expose complementary fragilities:
  - 0136_01 (single-record false-positive — FoodCourt concentration): model over-confidently predicted True for a moderate-concentration record (top1_share ≈ 0.58, sum_spend ≈ 721).
  - 0138_01 (single-record false-negative — all_zero): model predicted False for an all-zero-spend passenger (sum_spend == 0) whose true label was True.
  Together these show two related brittle modes tied to small-n (n==1) decisions:
    - concentration-by-channel slices where sign/strength differs by channel,
    - all_zero slices where pooled priors / interaction effects (Age, CryoSleep, Destination, Cabin) were not respected and uncertainty was under-estimated.
- Immediate implication: Stop auto-decisions on n==1 records that match fragile patterns (all_zero OR channel concentration OR extreme abs spend OR single-feature dominance) unless multiple, channel-aware context checks (smoothed slice prior, minimum slice N, GLM/ensemble consensus) pass. Add these records to canaries + a fast-audit queue.
- Top 5 priorities (0–72h):
  1. Enforce n==1 gating for fragile_flag (all_zero OR top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD OR sum_spend ≥ ABS_SPEND_HIGH OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH). Allow auto-decision only when channel-aware context_score + slice N + GLM/ensemble consensus + low se_combined are all satisfied.
  2. Persist channel-aware provenance and all_zero provenance in scoring outputs: top1_channel (NULL for all_zero), top1_channel_context_score, all_zero_context_score, per-slice N counts, var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, etc.
  3. Inflate uncertainty (SE) for fragile slices via explicit variance terms (var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, var_feature_dom) and dynamic SE floors by context strength.
  4. Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with explicit interactions including all_zero × CryoSleep × Age_bucket × Destination and top1_channel × top1_share × sum_spend × demographic interactions; upweight contradictory examples (all_zero=True & transported=True; concentrated non-transported cases) ×3–5; run ≥14 day shadow.
  5. Add targeted canaries (including 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01, 0133_02, 0134_01, 0136_01, 0138_01) and block auto-decisions for them until validations pass.

1) What specific patterns caused this error?
- 0138_01 pattern:
  - Derived fields: sum_spend = 0 → all_zero_flag = True; CryoSleep = True; Age = 13; Destination/Cabin possibly informative.
  - Model predicted False with high confidence; actual True → small-n false-negative on all_zero slice.
- Root causes:
  - All_zero treated as a single negative signal in the model or calibrator (global negative weight) without strong context conditioning (Age, CryoSleep, Destination, Cabin, HomePlanet).
  - Pooled priors were either not stratified for all_zero slices or N0 blending was too small, so the model logit dominated for n==1.
  - Variance inflation for all_zero slices (var_all_zero) was insufficient — calibrator under-expressed uncertainty for small-n all_zero records.
  - Training set lacked or underweighted all_zero-but-transported examples in the contexts that matter (young age, CryoSleep, certain cabins/destinations), so the model learned a biased sign.
  - Feature transforms and continuity across scorer / calibrator / fallback were inconsistent (e.g., winsorize/log1p differences), so the fallback/priors were not used effectively.

2) How should decision rules be modified to prevent recurrence?
- Make all_zero a first-class fragile flag and treat small-n records conservatively:
  - Add explicit all_zero gating: for n==1 and all_zero_flag == True, require:
    - all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high (suggest 0.80),
    - N_slice_all_zero_context ≥ N_min_zero_samples (suggest 25–50),
    - GLM_fallback_agrees (probability direction consistent),
    - ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high (0.995),
    - se_combined ≤ SE_accept (0.06) to auto-accept.
    Otherwise route to priority_audit (block auto-decision).
- Keep/extend the concentration gating for top1_channel concentration (top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD) but make it channel-aware: require top1_channel_context_score and N_slice_channel before auto-decision.
- For n in {2,3} relax numeric thresholds but still require both channel/all_zero context_score and GLM fallback agreement; inflate SE floors.
- Example gating pseudocode (simplified):
  - If n_batch == 1:
    - if all_zero_flag:
      - if all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high AND N_zero_samples ≥ N_min_zero AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept: allow_auto_decision()
      - else: priority_audit()
    - elif concentration_by_channel_flag:
      - require top1_channel_context_score ≥ Z_high AND N_slice_channel ≥ N_min_conc AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept else priority_audit()
    - elif abs_spend_flag or feature_dom_flag:
      - apply corresponding gating
    - else:
      - normal_gating()

3) What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?
- All_zero != “never transported”: spending==0 is insufficient alone to predict non-transported. Demographic and status interactions (Age, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, VIP) can flip the sign.
- Concentration sign is channel-dependent: FoodCourt vs ShoppingMall vs RoomService have different predictive directions and strengths; moderate concentration (~0.5–0.7) is a fragile band where small context changes flip labels.
- Small-n decisions should default toward pooled, context-conditioned priors and large uncertainty rather than high-confidence model logits.
- Label imbalance and rare-context slices (all_zero × young age × CryoSleep, concentrated × particular channel) are the primary sources of brittle single-record predictions.

4) How should confidence levels be recalibrated for more accurate batch predictions?
- Add explicit variance components and dynamic SE floors:
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_abs_spend = κ_abs * log1p(sum_spend)/scale * (1 − abs_spend_context_score)
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
- Combined variance and SE:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_concentration + var_abs_spend + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Dynamic SE floors:
  - weak-context all_zero/concentration_by_channel → se_floor = 0.25–0.35
  - strong-context slices → se_floor = 0.06–0.10
- Calibrator outputs p10/p50/p90 + sd. Gate auto-decisions on quantiles (require narrow p90−p10 and p10/p90 beyond thresholds) rather than single-point probability.

5) What adjustments are needed for better consistency across batch predictions?
- Standardize transforms and feature derivation across scorer, pooled-priors, calibrator, and GLM_fallback (winsorize/log1p, bucket boundaries, same age buckets).
- Persist and daily-refresh per-slice N counts for top1_channel × top1_share_bucket and all_zero × demographic slices.
- Pooled priors must be channel-aware and include an explicit all_zero pooled prior:
  - μ_all_zero_demo = P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination)
  - μ_conc_channel_demo = P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet)
  - Blend using τ = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice) with larger N0 for fragile slices; for all_zero use larger N0 (e.g., 50–200) so single-record logits are damped.
- Cap per-channel logit contributions (e.g., max 3–4 logits) or regularize with monotonic/sign priors per channel to avoid single-feature dominance.
- Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with interactions and upweighted contradictions; ensure the fallback is conservative and consistent with pooled priors for small-n.

6) How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?
- Monitoring & canaries:
  - New slice monitors: all_zero_by_ctx, concentration_by_channel_by_ctx: track ECE, Brier, FP, FN, contradiction_count, n==1_auto_accept_rate.
  - Add canaries: 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01, 0133_02, 0134_01, 0136_01, 0138_01. Block auto-accept until validated.
  - Global metric: n==1_auto_accept_contradiction_rate.
- Active learning:
  - Seed active-label queue with all_zero × age × CryoSleep and concentration_by_channel combinations to collect labels quickly and retrain.
- Retrain & CI:
  - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback, upweight contradictions ×3–5; shadow-run ≥14 days.
  - Target: ≥30–40% reduction in contradiction rate for all_zero_by_ctx and concentration_by_channel_by_ctx slices.
- Unit tests:
  - gating triggers for all_zero & concentration_by_channel for n==1,
  - se_combined increases when var_all_zero or var_conc_by_channel apply,
  - calibrator quantile spread widens for weak-context slices,
  - pooled prior blending respects N0 per slice.

COMPLETE updated predictive metrics report — actionable components

A. New / updated feature definitions (v→v+1)
- sum_spend = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck (raw & log1p).
- all_zero_flag = (sum_spend == 0 AND num_nonzero_channels == 0).
- all_zero_context_score = smoothed P(transported | all_zero=True, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin).
- top1_channel, top1_spend, top1_share:
  - If all_zero_flag → top1_share = NULL, concentration_type = 'all_zero'
  - Else → top1_channel = argmax(channel_spend); top1_share = top1_spend / max(1, sum_spend)
- concentration_by_channel_flag = (top1_share ≥ TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD) ; TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- top1_share_bucket = [0–0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.7, 0.7–0.9, 0.9–1.0]
- top1_channel_context_score = smoothed P(transported | top1_channel, top1_share_bucket, Age_bucket, CryoSleep, HomePlanet, Destination) with Bayesian smoothing α
- all_zero_pos_frac = empirical transported fraction for all_zero slice (unsmoothed)
- spend_entropy_norm = normalized Shannon entropy across channel spends
- feature_dom_fraction = fraction of absolute logit contribution from top feature; single_feature_influence_flag if ≥ FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH (0.60)

B. Pooled priors extension (channel-aware + all_zero)
- μ_all_zero_demo: mean P(transported) stratified by all_zero=True × Age_bucket × CryoSleep × HomePlanet × Destination × Cabin × VIP.
- μ_conc_channel_demo: mean P(transported) stratified by top1_channel × top1_share_bucket × Age_bucket × CryoSleep × HomePlanet × Destination.
- Blend:
  - τ_slice = N_slice / (N_slice + N0_slice)
  - N0_all_zero larger (suggest default 50, sweep 25–200); N0_concentration larger for fragile channels (e.g., ShoppingMall N0=50–200).
  - μ_blended_slice = τ_slice * μ_slice + (1 − τ_slice) * μ_global_slice
  - p_final = w_data * p_model + (1 − w_data) * μ_blended_slice, with w_data = n / (n + N0_slice)

C. Direction-aware logit shifts (pattern & channel treatment)
- Channel shift (damped by slice N and context):
  - channel_shift_frac = clamp(base_channel_shift + w_chan_ctx*(top1_channel_context_score − 0.5)*2 + w_chan_age*age_norm, −0.5, 0.5)
- All_zero shift:
  - all_zero_shift_frac = clamp(base_all_zero_shift + w_zero_ctx*(all_zero_context_score − 0.5)*2 + w_age*age_norm, −0.5, 0.5)
- Apply additive logit offsets only when context strong or N_slice sufficient; otherwise damp by τ_slice.

D. Variance / SE model (explicit)
- New variance terms (sweepable κ):
  - var_conc_by_channel = κ_conc_chan * (1 − top1_channel_context_score) * (top1_share^2) * log1p(sum_spend)
  - var_all_zero = κ_zero * (1 − all_zero_context_score) * sqrt(1 + num_imputed_features) * novelty_scale
  - var_missingness = κ_miss * missingness_count * novelty_scale
  - var_abs_spend = κ_abs * log1p(sum_spend)/scale * (1 − abs_spend_context_score)
  - var_feature_dom = κ_dom * max(0, feature_dom_fraction − FEATURE_DOMINANCE_BASE)
  - var_spend_scale = κ_scale * log1p(sum_spend)
- Combine:
  - var_combined = var_base + var_dispersion + var_spend_scale + var_all_zero + var_missingness + var_concentration + var_abs_spend + var_feature_dom + var_conc_by_channel
  - se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, base_min_se(context)^2))
- Example κ defaults:
  - κ_conc_chan = 0.06, κ_zero = 0.08, κ_miss = 0.05, κ_abs = 0.05, κ_dom = 0.07, κ_scale = 0.02
- Dynamic SE floors:
  - weak-context all_zero/concentration_by_channel → se_floor = 0.25–0.35
  - strong-context → se_floor = 0.06–0.10

E. Decision-gating (pattern & channel-aware; concrete)

  - TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
  - FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
  - ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800
  - Z_high = 0.80
  - N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
  - N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
  - A_high = 0.995
  - SE_accept = 0.06 (raise to 0.08–0.12 for n≤3)
- Pseudocode:
  - function decide(record, n_batch):
      compute features and context scores
      fragile_flags = [all_zero_flag, concentration_by_channel_flag, abs_spend_flag, feature_dom_flag]
      if n_batch == 1 and any(fragile_flags):
        if all_zero_flag:
          if all_zero_context_score ≥ Z_high and N_zero_samples ≥ N_min_zero_samples and GLM_fallback_agrees and se_combined ≤ SE_accept:
            allow_auto_decision()
          else:
            priority_audit('all_zero_stopgap')
        elif concentration_by_channel_flag:
          if top1_channel_context_score ≥ Z_high and N_slice_channel ≥ N_min_conc_by_channel and ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high and GLM_fallback_agrees and se_combined ≤ SE_accept:
            allow_auto_decision()
          else:
            priority_audit('concentration_by_channel_stopgap', top1_channel)
        elif abs_spend_flag or feature_dom_flag:
          apply corresponding gating
      else:
        normal_gating()
- For n in 2..3: require higher context_score and GLM_fallback agreement; use higher SE_accept.

  - n==1_auto_accept_rate spike → hold gating changes + alert
- Canaries:

H. CI tests & validation
- Unit tests:
  - n==1 gating triggers for all_zero_flag and concentration_by_channel_flag
  - top1_share NULL for all_zero_flag in all pipeline components
  - se_combined increases when var_all_zero/var_conc_by_channel apply

I. Operational actions (0–72 hours)
1. Immediate engineering (0–12h):
   - Persist top1_channel, top1_channel_context_score, top1_channel_pos_frac, all_zero_flag, all_zero_context_score, concentration_by_channel_flag, feature_dom_fraction and other flags in scoring provenance.
   - Implement n==1 gating: block auto-decision for any record with fragile_flag True (including all_zero) unless consensus per gating pseudocode passes.
   - Register canaries (add 0138_01 and others) and block auto-accept.
2. Scoring engine updates (12–48h):
   - Expose var_conc_by_channel, var_all_zero, var_feature_dom and se_combined in provenance; ensure identical winsorize/log1p transforms and cap per-channel logit contribution temporarily.
3. ML pipeline (24–72h):
   - Retrain calibrator & GLM_fallback with new features & interactions; upweight contradictions; start 14+ day shadow validation.
   - Publish updated pooled priors & N_slice per channel-slice daily.
4. Monitoring & ops (24–72h):
   - Deploy dashboards & alerts for all_zero_by_ctx and concentration_by_channel_by_ctx and canaries.
   - Seed active-label queue with all_zero × age × CryoSleep combos and concentrated-by-channel candidates for fast labeling.
5. Product/audit (24–72h):
   - Build fast-label UI & route priority_audit records for human review; label and feed back into active-learning retrain.

K. Hyperparameters (initial; sweepable)
- TOP1_CONC_THRESHOLD = 0.70
- FEATURE_DOMINANCE_THRESH = 0.60
- ABS_SPEND_HIGH = 800 (sweep 600–2500)
- Z_high = 0.80
- N_min_conc_by_channel = 25 (sweep 10–100)
- N_min_zero_samples = 25–50 (sweep 10–200)
- A_high = 0.995

- per-channel logit cap = 3.0–4.0 logits

L. CI canaries & expected behavior (problem IDs)
- 0126_01 (all_zero): expect gating_reason 'all_zero_stopgap'
- 0127_01 (high sum_spend ≈ 1022): expect 'abs_spend_or_feature_dom_stopgap'
- 0133_01 (all_zero): expect 'all_zero_stopgap'
- 0133_02 (RoomService extreme): expect 'abs_spend_or_feature_dom_stopgap'
- 0134_01 (ShoppingMall extreme concentration): expect 'concentration_by_channel_stopgap'
- 0136_01 (FoodCourt moderate concentration): expect 'concentration_by_channel_stopgap' for n==1 unless top1_channel_context_score≥Z_high & GLM agrees
- 0138_01 (all_zero): expect 'all_zero_stopgap' for n==1 unless all_zero_context_score≥Z_high & GLM agrees

M. Quick triage checklist for 0138_01 (immediate debugging)
1. Verify computed fields: sum_spend == 0, all_zero_flag == True, top1_channel == NULL, spend_entropy_norm == 0, num_nonzero_channels == 0.
2. Compute all_zero_context_score for slice (all_zero=True, Age_bucket=10–14, CryoSleep=True, HomePlanet=Earth, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e). Is N_zero_samples small? If so, block.
3. Inspect μ_all_zero_demo and τ_slice_blend; for n==1 τ small, so blended prior should dominate unless N0_all_zero was set too low.
4. Inspect se_combined and var_all_zero; was var_all_zero applied? If not, calibrator under-estimated uncertainty.
5. Inspect GLM_fallback output & ensemble agreement. If fallback predicted True but ensemble produced False, this should have triggered priority_audit per gating.
6. If all_zero_context_score < Z_high or GLM_fallback_disagrees → priority_audit + add to active-label queue; add to canaries.

Why these changes will reduce batch errors going forward
- Treating all_zero as a first-class fragile pattern prevents blanket negative assumptions; channel-aware/context-aware priors avoid sign errors.
- Larger N0 and slice-specific blending cause single-record logits to be damped and revert to more stable pooled priors when slice N is low.
- Explicit per-slice variance terms (var_all_zero, var_conc_by_channel, var_feature_dom) force higher uncertainty for fragile patterns and reduce overconfident auto-decisions.
- Retraining calibrator & GLM_fallback with interactions and upweighted contradictions corrects learned signs and improves fallback strength for edge slices.
- Provenance + canaries + active labeling accelerate detection and correction of recurring brittle slices.

Immediate one-line corrective action
- Enforce n==1 gating: route any record with all_zero_flag == True OR top1_share ≥ 0.70 OR sum_spend ≥ 800 OR feature_dom_fraction ≥ 0.60 to priority_audit unless the pattern_context_score (all_zero_context_score or top1_channel_context_score) ≥ 0.80 AND GLM_fallback/ensemble consensus AND se_combined ≤ 0.06 — add 0126_01, 0127_01, 0133_01, 0133_02, 0134_01, 0136_01 and 0138_01 to canaries and block auto-accept.

Acceptance criteria for promotion
- Shadow-run ≥14 days.
- Target: contradictions in all_zero_by_ctx and concentration_by_channel_by_ctx slices reduced by ≥30–40%.
- Global ECE not worsen by >0.5–1.0% absolute.
- No canary auto-accepted; canary gating consistent with spec.
- Per-channel sign-consistency drift monitored and within acceptable bounds.

Next-step offer
- I can deliver a minimal, immediately-deployable gating patch (code-level pseudocode + CI tests) to implement the n==1 stopgap (including all_zero gating) within 2–12 hours. Or I can produce a full retrain spec for calibrator & GLM_fallback (dataset selection, upweighting, CV folds, hyperparameter sweeps, acceptance criteria, monitoring dashboards). Which would you like now?
