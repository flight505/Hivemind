PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 171
============================================================

Executive summary — immediate takeaways & top priorities (0–72h)

- What happened (short)
  - We now have three small‑batch failure modes converging:
    1. Missingness collapse → FN (0210_01): pre‑imputation NaNs became zeros; record collapsed into all_zero/cryo prior that favored non‑transport.
    2. Implausible / extremely high total spend → FP (0211_03): outlier total spend drove overconfident prediction; no dampening or uncertainty inflation.
    3. Single‑channel outlier / large top1 spend → FP (0212_01 — new): VRDeck 739 (+ other spends 192, 51) produced a dominant positive logit, model predicted True but actual False. This slipped past the IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD (1000) because total ≈ 982; top1 absolute value was the problem but not the sum.
  - Shared systemic causes:
    - Failure to preserve pre‑imputation missingness signatures (NaN→0 collapse).
    - Single‑feature / top1 dominance (by absolute value) producing overconfident logits.
    - Thresholding only on sum_raw_spend (1000) misses large single‑channel outliers below that threshold.
    - Calibrator under‑estimated uncertainty for n==1 and novel signatures; no channel‑aware heteroskedasticity.
    - No per‑channel caps or channel‑specific implausible‑spend detection.

- Immediate risk
  - Any n==1 record with: cryo_allzero_flag, missing_homeplanet/destination, high_top1_value_flag, single_channel_dominant, implausible_spend, imputed_count ≥1, or high novelty_distance is high risk for overconfident, wrong auto decisions.

- Immediate action (deploy now)
  - Emergency gating hotfix: expand fragile flags to include high_top1_value_flag (absolute per‑channel), per‑channel implausible_spend_flag (e.g., VRDeck_high). Route any n==1 with fragile flags to priority_audit. Add canaries: include 0212_01 in canary block.
  - For large absolute top1 spends (top1_value_raw ≥ TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS) treat as fragile: downweight per_feature logits, increase variance term, require GLM fallback + ensemble corroboration.

Concise answers to the six operational questions (batch accuracy focus)

1) Which specific patterns caused the error?
   - 0212_01: A large absolute VRDeck spend (739) produced a dominant positive logit even though total spend < IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD. No top1_abs flag or channel‑specific dampening existed; calibrator didn't treat it as fragile and returned narrow p90−p10 → FP.
   - Shared with previous failures: missingness collapse (0210_01) and outlier‑driven overconfidence (0211_03). The model trusts large per‑feature signals and underestimates uncertainty for singleton novel signatures.

2) How should decision rules be modified?
   - Add absolute top‑channel thresholds (high_top1_value_flag) and per‑channel implausible thresholds (e.g., VRDeck_implausible).
   - For n==1 fragile records require: pooled_prior_tau high + minimum N_slice + GLM_fallback_agreement + ensemble agreement + se/p90−p10 gating. Otherwise route to priority_audit.
   - Downweight or dampen high absolute channel spends before computing logits (channel‑specific α_dom).

3) New transport‑pattern insights?
   - Channel semantics differ: very high VRDeck spend behaves differently from equally high RoomService or Spa spends — treat channel identity explicitly.
   - Large absolute single‑channel spends can be artifacts or cohort‑specific signals not reflected by sum_total thresholds.
   - Missing demographic signals (HomePlanet/Destination) and top1 channel jointly increase label uncertainty.

4) How should confidence be recalibrated?
   - Heteroskedastic quantile calibrator must include fragility flags (high_top1_value_flag, per_channel_implausible_flag), top1_channel, top1_value_raw, and missingness_signature.
   - Add channel‑specific variance components and SE floors for n==1 and top1_high contexts; widen p10/p90 accordingly.

5) Adjustments for batch consistency?
   - Compute batch_frac_fragile (include new flags). If above threshold, hold entire batch.
   - For n==1 batches apply stricter gating: require GLM + ensemble corroboration and narrow quantile width before auto decisions.

6) How can metrics be improved for edge cases like this?
   - Preserve pre‑imputation NaN signatures and imputation provenance.
   - Add per‑channel implausible thresholds and top1_absolute flags so outliers are detected even when total < global threshold.
   - Per‑feature logit caps, channel‑specific dominance dampening, mixture priors stratified by top1_channel, and GLM fallback as concordance check.

Complete updated predictive metrics report — actionable components (optimized for batch prediction accuracy)

A. Immediate emergency actions (0–6h)
- Emergency gating hotfix (expandable rules):
  - If n_batch == 1 AND (cryo_allzero_flag OR all_zero_infant_flag OR all_zero_missing_cryo_flag OR missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag OR single_channel_dominant_flag OR high_top1_value_flag OR implausible_spend_flag OR novelty_high_flag OR missing_channel_count ≥ 1 OR imputed_count ≥ 1) → block auto decision, route to priority_audit.
  - For any record with sum_raw_spend ≥ IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD OR top1_value_raw ≥ TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS → treat as fragile (downweight logits, raise variance) and require audit unless gating checks pass.
- Canary additions (block auto decisions while gating active): add 0212_01 to the previous list: 0192_01, 0192_03, 0193_03, 0196_01, 0198_01, 0200_01, 0205_01, 0207_01, 0210_01, 0211_03, 0212_01.
- Persist provenance immediately for canaries and fragiles (raw NaNs preserved).
- SE floors for n==1 fragiles:
  - n==1 & cryo_allzero OR missing_homeplanet OR missing_destination OR missing_channel_count ≥1: se_floor = 0.60
  - n==1 & all_zero_infant: se_floor = 0.65
  - n==1 & implausible_spend OR high_top1_value: se_floor = 0.65
- Require GLM_fallback + ensemble corroboration before any auto decision for fragile slices.

B. Flag & feature definitions (compute pre‑imputation where applicable)
- Reuse prior flags and add:
  - top1_channel, top1_value_raw, top1_share_raw = top1_value_raw / (sum_raw + ε).
  - high_top1_value_flag: top1_value_raw ≥ TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS (start 700) OR top1_value_raw ≥ channel_specific_percentile (e.g., ≥ 99.5th percentile for that channel).
  - per_channel_implausible_flag[channel]: channel_raw ≥ CHANNEL_IMPLAUSIBLE_THRESHOLD[channel] OR channel_raw > 3×channel_99.9pct.
  - channel_specific_caps: channel_caps = {VRDeck: VRDECK_CAP, RoomService: RS_CAP, ...}.
- Keep: all_zero_flag (pre‑imputation), missing_homeplanet_flag, missing_destination_flag, missing_channel_count, cryo_allzero_flag, single_channel_dominant_flag.
- missingness_signature: bitmask/hash of which channels & demographics are missing.

C. Feature engineering updates (v→v+1)
- Persist raw inputs and imputation provenance; compute flags pre‑imputation.
- New features: high_top1_value_flag, per_channel_implausible_flags, top1_channel_onehot, channel_specific_nrmlz_top1 (top1_value / channel_median), channel_entropy, top1_value_zscore (per channel).
- Winsorize spends at channel‑specific caps (use 99.5th percentile or absolute caps) and also log1p transform; keep raw channels as provenance.

D. Pooled priors & mixture modeling (to represent heterogeneity)
- Stratify pooled priors with top1_channel and high_top1_value_flag:
  - all_zero × CryoSleep_state × age_bucket × top1_channel
  - top1_channel × high_top1_value_flag × age_bucket
  - implausible_spend slice × top1_channel
- Detect subclusters inside high_top1/top1_channel slices using GMM/KMeans on (demographics, raw_spend_vector, missingness_signature, family_size, cabin_deck). Compute μ_cluster and N_cluster and blend by membership probability at scoring time.
- Pseudo‑counts (start values; sweepable):
  - N0_top1_channel = 600
  - N0_high_top1 = 500
  - Keep previous N0_all_zero etc.
- Blend formula unchanged; persist pooled_prior_snapshot_id.

E. Per‑feature logit caps, winsorization & dominance dampening (channel‑aware)
- Global caps (start):
  - CAP_PER_CHANNEL_LOGIT = 1.0
  - CAP_TOP1_SPEND_LOGIT = 1.2
  - CAP_ALL_ZERO_FEATURE_LOGIT = 1.0
- Channel‑specific caps:
  - CAP_VRDECK_LOGIT = 1.0 (tighter)
  - CAP_ROOMSERVICE_LOGIT = 1.2
  - CAP_SHOPPINGMALL_LOGIT = 1.1
- Dominance dampening:
  - if single_channel_dominant_flag then top channel value := α_dom * top channel (α_dom start 0.6).
  - if high_top1_value_flag and top1_channel == 'VRDeck' then α_dom_vrdeck = 0.5 (stronger dampening).
- For implausible_spend_flag or high_top1_value_flag: downweight per_feature logits (×0.5 → ×0.7 tunable) and increase variance term.
- Enforce per_feature_logit = sign(l) * min(abs(l), cap) and log per_feature_caps_triggered.

F. Variance / SE model enhancements (add channel & top1 terms)
- Add variance components κ:
  - κ_top1_high = 0.50
  - κ_vrdeck_high = 0.55
  - keep previous κ_all_zero etc.
- var_combined = var_base + Σ(indicator*κ_component)
- se_combined = sqrt(max(var_combined, se_floor(context)^2))
- se_floor for n==1 with high_top1_value_flag = 0.65

G. Decision‑gating (pattern‑aware + batch/cohort aware)
- fragile_flag_v3 = cryo_allzero_flag OR all_zero_infant_flag OR all_zero_missing_cryo_flag OR missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag OR single_channel_dominant_flag OR implausible_spend_flag OR high_top1_value_flag OR (imputed_count ≥ 2) OR (missing_channel_count ≥ 1) OR (novelty_distance ≥ NOVELTY_THRESHOLD)
- batch_frac_fragile = #fragile_records_in_batch / batch_size
  - If batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD (start 5%) → route whole batch to priority_audit.
- n==1 fragile gating (must pass ALL to auto accept/reject):
  - pooled_prior_tau ≥ τ_high_slice AND N_slice ≥ N_min_slice,
  - GLM_fallback_agrees (|p_model − p_glm| ≤ δ_slice),
  - ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high,
  - se_combined ≤ SE_accept_slice AND (p90 − p10) ≤ QW_accept_slice.
  - Otherwise route to priority_audit.
- For per_channel_implausible_flag OR high_top1_value_flag: require stricter GLM + ensemble concordance.

H. Calibrator & GLM_fallback retrain plan (fragile & top1 focused)
- Calibrator:
  - Heteroskedastic quantile calibrator producing p10/p50/p90 + variance head.
  - Inputs: raw_model_logit, per_feature_logit_contributions, fragility flags (including high_top1), top1_channel, top1_value_raw, channel_entropy, missingness_signature, age_bucket, winsorized_sum_spend.
  - Loss = quantile pinball (p10/p90) + ECE penalty + Brier; upweight fragile slices & high_top1 examples (×8–15).
- GLM_fallback:
  - ElasticNet logistic on winsorized log1p features + interactions: top1_channel×top1_value, top1_channel×cabin_deck, top1_channel×age_bucket, all_zero×CryoSleep, missing_homeplanet×age.
  - GLM acts as concordance check and interpretable fallback for gating.
- Training:
  - Rolling window 18–36 months; upsample/weight fragile slices and high_top1 signatures.
  - CV stratified by fragile slices and top1_channel.
  - Shadow run: 14–28 days with gating active.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - high_top1 slice FP_rate ↓ by 40–70% (slice-level)
  - VRDeck_high FP_rate ↓ ≥ 50%
  - Missing_homeplanet FN_rate ↓ by ≥ 50% on held‑out validation
  - Global ECE not worsened by >0.5% absolute

I. Handling heterogeneous slices (mixture modeling + top1)
- For cryo_allzero, all_zero and high_top1 / top1_channel slices, detect subclusters with GMM/KMeans on demographics + raw spends + missingness_signature + family_size + cabin_deck. Build μ_cluster, N_cluster; compute blended prior by cluster membership probability.
- At scoring time compute posterior predictive probability as weighted sum of cluster posteriors to avoid averaging opposing signals.

J. Monitoring, metrics & alerts (batch‑focused)
- Real‑time slice KPIs:
  - cryo_allzero_FN_rate & FP_rate (split by age_bucket, deck, missingness_signature)
  - high_top1_FP_rate & FN_rate by top1_channel (VRDeck, RoomService, etc.)
  - per_channel_implausible_FP_rate & FN_rate
  - n==1_auto_accept_rate, n==1_fragile_auto_accept_rate
  - batch_frac_fragile, cohort_contradiction_rate
- Alerts:
  - Any canary auto_accepted/rejected → immediate page
  - high_top1_FP rise > baseline + X% over 24h → page
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold → hold auto_decisions & notify
- Dashboards:
  - Per‑record provenance for canaries and recent fragile auto‑decisions: raw vs winsorized, per_feature_logits & caps, pooled_prior_snapshot, novelty_distance, cluster_id, missingness_summary.

K. CI unit tests & validation (cover fragile & top1 slices)
- Unit tests:
  - Pre‑imputation flags: cryo_allzero_flag, all_zero_flag, missing_homeplanet_flag, high_top1_value_flag computed correctly.
  - se_combined reaches se_floor for n==1 cryo_allzero, missing_homeplanet, single_channel_dominant, implausible_spend, high_top1.
  - Calibrator widens p10/p90 for simulated missingness and high‑top1 records.
  - Pooled_prior blending logic prevents tiny N slices from dominating.
  - Per_feature logit caps & dominance dampening enforced, with channel caps applied for VRDeck.
  - batch_frac_fragile ≥ threshold disables auto_decisions for a batch.
  - Canaries (including 0212_01) must not be auto_accepted/rejected while gating is active.
- Regression tests:
  - Global ECE, AUC, Brier degrade less than tolerances when gating enabled.

L. Operational actions & timeline (0–72h)
1) Immediate (0–6h):
   - Deploy emergency gating (expanded fragile set including high_top1_value_flag) and block canaries (include 0212_01).
   - Persist provenance for canaries; expose variance components and calibrator outputs.
2) Short‑term (6–24h):
   - Implement feature flags and lightweight GLM_fallback; implement batch_frac_fragile and cohort contradiction detection.
   - Instrument dashboards & alerts; begin manual review/label collection for fragiles and high_top1 cases.
   - Add data validation rule for per‑channel implausible spends and missingness spikes.
3) Mid‑term (24–72h):
   - Retrain heteroskedastic quantile calibrator and GLM_fallback with upweighted fragile + high_top1 slices; run 14–28 day shadow run with gating active.
   - Implement channel‑specific caps and cluster‑specific priors; tune caps, κ and α_dom using shadow diagnostics.
   - Tune gating thresholds to balance throughput and safety.

M. Per‑record provenance to log (required minimum)
- Raw per_channel spends (with NaNs preserved) + per_channel_imputed_flags + imputation_method + source_date.
- CryoSleep raw + missing_cryo_flag, HomePlanet raw + missing_homeplanet_flag, Destination raw + missing_destination_flag, Age, Age_bucket, family_name, family_group_size, cabin_deck, destination.
- Transforms & flags: winsorized_spend[channel], winsorized_sum_spend, all_zero_flag, all_zero_missing_cryo_flag, all_zero_infant_flag, cryo_allzero_flag, missingness_signature, top1_channel, top1_value_raw, top1_share_raw, high_top1_value_flag, per_channel_implausible_flags, single_channel_dominant_flag, channel_entropy, novelty_distance, cluster_id, missingness_summary.
- Model internals: per_feature_logit_contributions, per_feature_logit_caps_triggered, pooled_prior_snapshot_id, μ_slice/μ_cluster, τ_slice_blend.
- Variances: var_components, var_combined, se_combined.
- Decision meta: GLM_fallback_probs, GLM_fallback_agreement_flag, ensemble_probs, ensemble_agreement, p10/p50/p90, quantile_width, gating_reasons, routing_decision, scorer_version.

N. Initial hyperparameters (start values; sweepable)
- INFANT_AGE_THRESHOLD = 1.0
- TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS = 700 (triggers high_top1_value_flag)
- Per‑channel suspicious caps example: VRDECK_IMPLAUSIBLE = 700; ROOMSERVICE_IMPLAUSIBLE = 1000
- IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD (sum) = 1000 (keep but supplement with TOP1_SUSPICIOUS_ABS)
- SE floors n==1: cryo_allzero = 0.60; single_dom = 0.60; all_zero_missing_cryo = 0.60; all_zero_infant = 0.65; missing_homeplanet = 0.60; missing_channel_count ≥1 = 0.60; implausible_spend/high_top1 = 0.65
- N0_top1_channel = 600; N_min_top1 = 60
- κ_top1_high = 0.50; κ_vrdeck_high = 0.55; keep previous κ values
- τ_high_slice = 0.95; A_high = 0.995
- SE_accept_all_zero = 0.60; SE_accept_single_dom = 0.60; δ_slice (fragile) = 0.05
- BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD = 0.05
- QW_accept_slice = 0.12
- DOMINANCE_TOP1_SHARE = 0.90; DOMINANCE_MIN_SPEND = 200; α_dom = 0.6; α_dom_vrdeck = 0.5
- CAP_PER_CHANNEL_LOGIT = 1.0; CAP_TOP1_SPEND_LOGIT = 1.2; CAP_VRDECK_LOGIT = 1.0

O. CI canaries & expected behavior
- Canary list: add 0212_01 to the existing: 0192_01, 0192_03, 0193_03, 0196_01, 0198_01, 0200_01, 0205_01, 0207_01, 0210_01, 0211_03, 0212_01.
- Expected route: priority_audit while emergency gating is active.
- CI asserts canaries are not auto_accepted/rejected.

P. Gating pseudocode (pattern‑aware, batch focused, updated)
- For each batch B:
  - batch_frac_fragile = count(r in B where fragile_flag_v3)/|B|
  - if batch_frac_fragile ≥ BATCH_FRAGILE_THRESHOLD:
      route all r in B -> priority_audit; continue
  - for each record r in B:
      compute pre‑imputation flags (all_zero_flag, missing_homeplanet_flag, missing_channel_count, CryoSleep raw)
      compute top1_channel, top1_value_raw, top1_share_raw
      compute per_channel_implausible_flags and high_top1_value_flag
      compute fragile_flag_v3 (includes high_top1, per_channel_implausible)
      if n_batch == 1 and fragile_flag_v3:
         if (pooled_prior_tau ≥ τ_high_slice AND N_slice ≥ N_min_slice AND GLM_fallback_agrees AND ensemble_agreement ≥ A_high AND se_combined ≤ SE_accept_slice AND (p90 − p10) ≤ QW_accept_slice):
             allow auto_decision
         else:
             route r -> priority_audit
         continue
      if per_channel_implausible_flag OR high_top1_value_flag:
         downweight per_feature logits; route r -> priority_audit unless GLM+ensemble concordant AND se_combined small
      if missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag:
         route r -> data_quality_review + priority_audit
         continue
      if cohort_id present and cohort predictions conflict in sign:
         route cohort -> priority_audit

Q. Specific diagnoses (detailed)

- Passenger 0212_01 (FP) — chain of failure & root cause
  - Raw: RoomService 192.0, FoodCourt 0.0, ShoppingMall 0.0, Spa 51.0, VRDeck 739.0 — top1_channel VRDeck = 739; sum_raw_spend ≈ 982.
  - Likely chain:
    1) Preprocessing either did not winsorize channel‑specific outliers sufficiently or lacked a VRDeck absolute cap; top1_value_raw remained high.
    2) Per_feature logit for VRDeck was large and uncapped (or cap too loose); dominance dampening either not applied or insufficient for VRDeck.
    3) IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEND_THRESHOLD on sum (1000) was not triggered because sum ≈ 982, so no implausible_spend_flag.
    4) Calibrator lacked high_top1_value_flag and top1_channel as inputs; returned narrow quantiles and low se for an n==1 record → auto accept.
    5) GLM_fallback either not present or correlated features caused agreement; no gating kicked in. Result: FP.
  - Immediate mitigation: add high_top1_value_flag; treat VRDeck_high as fragile; downweight logits; require GLM+ensemble concordance.

- 0210_01 (FN) and 0211_03 (FP) — kept in remediation plan as previously described.

R. Why these changes reduce batch errors (short)
- Preserving pre‑imputation NaN flags prevents semantic collapse that caused 0210_01.
- High_top1_value detection catches single‑channel outliers like 0212_01 that sum‑based thresholds miss.
- Channel‑aware caps and dominance dampening limit single feature domination (0211_03 and 0212_01).
- Heteroskedastic calibrator + SE floors + GLM fallback prevent overconfident n==1 auto decisions.

S. Tradeoffs & operational notes
- Expect increased priority_audit volume at first (especially for top1_high and per‑channel implausible cases). Provision triage staff and tune thresholds in shadow run.
- Channel‑specific caps and extra features increase model complexity and storage (provenance), but reduce high‑impact errors.
- Global metrics may temporarily fluctuate; prioritize slice‑level improvements and batch accuracy for small batches.

T. Next steps / recommended sequencing
- Option A (Immediate, 0–3h): Deploy emergency gating + unit tests + canary block (include 0212_01). I can produce runnable gating code + unit tests and CI patch now.
- Option B (24–72h): Retrain calibrator + GLM_fallback + implement per‑channel caps + mixture priors + shadow run + dashboards. I can provide pipeline spec, retrain plan, sweep matrix, and dashboard spec for the 24–72h plan.

One‑line immediate action (deploy now)
- Route any n==1 record with cryo_allzero_flag OR all_zero_infant_flag OR all_zero_missing_cryo_flag OR missing_homeplanet_flag OR missing_destination_flag OR single_channel_dominant_flag OR high_top1_value_flag OR implausible_spend_flag OR novelty_high_flag OR missing_channel_count ≥1 to priority_audit; add canaries including 0210_01, 0211_03 and 0212_01 and block them from auto decisions until mitigations are deployed.

Would you like me to:
- Produce the emergency gating implementation now (runnable code + unit tests + CI patch) so canaries and n==1 fragiles are immediately blocked, or
- Produce the full retraining pipeline specification (heteroskedastic quantile calibrator + GLM_fallback + mixture priors), sweep matrix, and shadow‑run dashboard spec for the 24–72h plan?

Recommendation: deploy the hotfix gating immediately (include high_top1_value detection & VRDeck per‑channel implausible detection) and persist provenance; I can generate the gating code + unit tests in the next message for fast deployment.
