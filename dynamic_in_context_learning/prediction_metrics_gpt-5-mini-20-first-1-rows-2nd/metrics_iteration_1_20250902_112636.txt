PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 1
============================================================

Summary — what happened and top corrective actions
- The model over-predicted passenger 0017_02 (Philda Brighttt). The original rule-based aggregator combined several positive signals (Deck F, Side P, Earth, 1000–5000 spend, child) that—given the tiny training set—overwhelmed the CryoSleep = False negative signal and produced P ≈ 0.66 → predicted Transported (True). Actual label was False.
- Root cause: small-sample, correlated features and over-reliance on categorical p-values with insufficient reliability-weighting. Several small-n or outlier-driven signals (child n small, spending buckets influenced by a few high spenders) gave spurious lift.
- Immediate corrective moves I recommend and implementable now:
  1. Use reliability-based shrinkage of per-value probabilities toward the baseline (Bayesian/pseudo-count shrinkage).
  2. Scale (or shrink) feature weights according to per-value sample sizes (reduce influence of small-n buckets).
  3. Compute and return a formal confidence score that can trigger abstention/manual review for low-evidence, borderline predictions.
  4. Add a conservative tie-break rule in batches: if prediction confidence is low and p_final is near the decision threshold, default to Not Transported (or flag for review) to reduce false positives.
- Below is a COMPLETE updated predictive-metrics report that (a) incorporates the new labeled example, (b) explains what went wrong, (c) gives an updated scoring formula (operational), and (d) describes concrete model/rule changes to prevent similar future errors.

A. Updated dataset summary (after adding the labelled case 0017_02)
- Total rows: 21
- Transported = True: 13 (raw 13/21 ≈ 61.90%). Smoothed baseline P(Transported) with Laplace add-one: p0 = (13+1)/(21+2) = 14/23 ≈ 0.6087.
- Not transported = 8 (raw 8/21 ≈ 38.10%).

B. What specifically caused the error (detailed analysis)
Passenger 0017_02 (Philda Brighttt) — features:
- HomePlanet = Earth
- CryoSleep = False
- Cabin = F/6/P → Deck = F, Side = P
- Destination = 55 Cancri e
- Age = 14 → Age group = child (1–17)
- VIP = False
- TotalSpend = 412 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 679 = 1,092 → bucket 1000–5000

Why the model predicted True
- Under the original scoring (prior report) the influential p_i values were:
  - Deck F (smoothed) ≈ 0.75 (strong positive)
  - Side P ≈ 0.692
  - HomePlanet Earth ≈ 0.692
  - Spending 1000–5000 ≈ 0.75
  - Age child ≈ 0.75 (but n small)
  - CryoSleep False ≈ 0.556 (a weaker negative)
  - Destination 55 Cancri e ≈ 0.5 (neutral)
- The linear weighted aggregation (original weights) produced a p_final ≈ 0.67 (above 0.5), so labelled True. In-sample, many of these buckets had high raw transport rates, so their combined influence overcame CryoSleep False.
- But most of those positive buckets were partially spurious: some were low-n (child n small), some were driven by a few high-spenders, and several features are correlated. The model had insufficient shrinkage/reliability weighting.

C. Updated smoothed per-feature probabilities (Laplace add-one) — counts and new smoothed P
(Only changed buckets are listed; others remain as in the prior report.)
- Baseline p0 (smoothed) = 14/23 ≈ 0.6087
- CryoSleep:
  - True: n=4 → p = (4+1)/(4+2) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333 (unchanged)
  - False: n=17 → p = (9+1)/(17+2) = 10/19 ≈ 0.5263 (was ≈ 0.556)
- Deck:
  - F: n=11 → p = (8+1)/(11+2) = 9/13 ≈ 0.6923 (was ≈ 0.75)
  - B: n=4 → p = 4/6 = 0.6667 (unchanged)
  - G: n=3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6
  - A: n=2 → p = 1/4 = 0.25
- Side:
  - P: n=12 → p = (8+1)/(12+2) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 (was 0.692)
  - S: n=8 → p = 6/10 = 0.6
- HomePlanet:
  - Earth: n=12 → p = (8+1)/(12+2) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 (was 0.692)
  - Europa: n=6 → p = 4/8 = 0.5
  - Mars: n=3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6
- Destination:
  - TRAPPIST-1e: n=15 → p = 11/17 ≈ 0.6471
  - 55 Cancri e: n=5 → p = 3/7 ≈ 0.4286 (down from 0.5)
  - PSO J318.5-22: n=1 → p = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667
- Age groups:
  - child (1–17): n=3 → p = (2+1)/(3+2) = 3/5 = 0.6 (down from 0.75)
  - young adult: n=12 → p = 8/14 ≈ 0.5714
  - older adult: n=5 → p = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714
  - infant: n=1 → p ≈ 0.6667
- Spending buckets:
  - total=0: n=6 → p = 6/8 = 0.75
  - 500–1000: n=5 → p = 3/7 ≈ 0.4286
  - 1000–5000: n=7 → p = 6/9 ≈ 0.6667 (down from 0.75)
  - >5000: n=3 → p = 2/5 = 0.4
- VIP:
  - True: n=1 → p = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333
  - False: n=20 → p = 14/22 ≈ 0.6364 (down from ≈0.667)

Interpretation of updated probabilities
- Some positive signals became less strong after adding the counterexample (notably Deck F, Earth, side P and the 1000–5000 spending bucket). That reduces overconfidence in those buckets but does not eliminate the positive tendency entirely.

D. Revised prioritized decision rules (summary)
I kept the family/group override as highest priority but revised the rest to include reliability-aware adjustments.

1) Family/group override — improved
- If any group members in the batch have known true labels: enforce consistency by majority with a rule that respects group size and evidence:
  - If ≥2 group members with labels and ≥67% agree → set all members to that label (High confidence).
- If group members all predicted (but unlabeled) and group mean p_final is extreme (mean ≥ 0.80 or ≤ 0.20) → adopt group consensus.
- If group members have diverse predictions (no strong consensus) → do not force; instead apply group-level smoothing (pull individual probabilities toward group mean by factor α = 0.25).

2) CryoSleep
- Keep as a strong factor but use reliability shrinkage: p(CryoSleep=True) remains high (≈0.833) but CryoSleep has moderate sample size—use reliability-weighted influence.

3) Deck & Side
- Deck F remains a positive signal but its smoothed p dropped from 0.75 → 0.692; treat deck as high-value but shrink its contributions if combined with other negative features (e.g., Cryo False + destination 55 Cancri negative).
- Side P remains mildly positive.

4) Spending
- Re-bucket spend with log transform / winsorization to reduce outlier effect; treat VRDeck spurts separately:
  - Compute TotalSpend = sum; convert to percentile buckets per HomePlanet when data volumes grow.
  - For now, treat 1000–5000 as positive but apply heavier shrinkage (small n).

5) Age
- Children produce a positive signal in the small sample but n is tiny → drastically reduce weight unless supported by group evidence. Do not treat child as a strong standalone positive in production.

6) HomePlanet / Destination
- TRAPPIST-1e and Earth still positive. 55 Cancri e should be treated cautiously (now p ≈ 0.4286).

7) VIP
- Weak signal; keep minimal weight.

E. Recommended, updated scoring formula (operational and conservative)
I replace the simple linear blend with a reliability-weighted, shrinkage-based, log-odds aggregation. This keeps transparency but reduces overfitting.

Operational step-by-step (implement this as a single-pass batch function):

1) Recompute baseline:
   - p0 = (T + 1) / (N + 2)   (Laplace add-one; after adding Philda => p0 = 14/23 ≈ 0.6087)

2) Per-feature smoothed probability:
   - For each feature value compute p_i_smoothed = (t_i + 1) / (n_i + 2)
     (If n_i = 0, set p_i_smoothed = p0.)

3) Reliability shrinkage toward baseline:
   - p_i_shrunk = (n_i / (n_i + k)) * p_i_smoothed + (k / (n_i + k)) * p0
   - Recommended default: k = 5 (tunable). This reduces the influence of small-n categories.

4) Convert to log-odds and compute per-feature delta:
   - logit0 = logit(p0) = ln(p0 / (1−p0))
   - delta_i = logit(p_i_shrunk) − logit0

5) Base feature weights (sum to 1):
   - Recommended starting weights (subject to reliability scaling):
     - CryoSleep: 0.30
     - Deck letter: 0.22
     - Spending bucket: 0.12
     - Age group: 0.08
     - HomePlanet: 0.10
     - Destination: 0.08
     - Side: 0.06
     - VIP: 0.04
   - Rationale: preserve relative ordering from prior analysis but give CryoSleep slightly more influence and age/spend slightly less.

6) Reliability scaling of weights:
   - r_i = n_i / (n_i + k2)   (use k2 = 5)
   - raw_w_i = base_w_i * r_i
   - Normalize: w_i = raw_w_i / Σ raw_w_j

7) Combine in log-odds:
   - logit_final = logit0 + Σ_i w_i * delta_i
   - p_final = sigmoid(logit_final) = 1 / (1 + exp(−logit_final))

8) Compute confidence/support metric:
   - support_i = |p_i_shrunk − p0| * r_i
   - support_total = Σ_i base_w_i * support_i
   - Map support_total to qualitative confidence:
     - High if support_total ≥ 0.08
     - Medium if 0.04 ≤ support_total < 0.08
     - Low if support_total < 0.04

9) Borderline / abstain rule (reduces false positives like Philda):
   - If support_total < 0.04 (Low confidence) AND |p_final − threshold| < δ (default threshold = 0.50, δ = 0.06), then:
     - Option A (conservative default): predict Not Transported (False).
     - Option B (preferred for high-stakes cases): abstain / flag for manual review.
   - Rationale: low-evidence, borderline probabilities are noisy in small-sample regimes — abstain or default to the safer label.

F. Worked example (Philda 0017_02) — new scoring + abstain policy
- Recomputed p0 = 14/23 ≈ 0.6087.
- Per-feature p_i_shrunk (k=5) — values used by the formula (computed earlier in analysis):
  - CryoSleep=False → p_shrunk ≈ 0.5446 (n=17)
  - Deck=F → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6662 (n=11)
  - Spending 1000–5000 → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6425 (n=7)
  - Age child → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6054 (n=3)
  - HomePlanet Earth → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6327 (n=12)
  - Destination 55 Cancri e → p_shrunk ≈ 0.5186 (n=5)
  - Side P → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6327 (n=12)
  - VIP=False → p_shrunk ≈ 0.6308 (n=20)
- Applying the log-odds combination with reliability-scaled normalized weights yields p_final ≈ 0.603 (≈ 60.3%).
- Compute support_total (as described): ≈ 0.0325 → Low confidence.
- Under the abstain/default rule (support_total < 0.04 and |p_final − 0.50| < 0.06), the system would:
  - Either abstain/flag for review, or (if conservative default is chosen) predict Not Transported → matches the actual label and eliminates this false positive.
- This shows how the new policy fixes this specific failure mode without aggressive manual overfitting.

G. How the decision rules are modified to prevent similar errors in future
- Use shrinkage (k=5) and reliability scaling (k2=5) to reduce small-n overconfidence.
- Reduce standalone power of age=child unless group evidence exists; children require extra evidence (e.g., family majority).
- Re-bucket spending (use logged percentiles) and treat platform-specific spends (VRDeck) as separate features or outlier indicators.
- Cap maximum per-feature contribution to log-odds (e.g., no single feature may change log-odds by more than ±0.6) to avoid single-feature domination.
- Introduce the abstain/low-confidence default rule to reduce borderline false positives.
- Enforce order-independent group reconciliation at batch-level (use group-level smoothing/majority).

H. Recalibrating confidence levels & how to use them in production
- New confidence formula is evidence-based (support_total described above).
- Operational mapping:
  - High confidence → allow threshold-based binary classification (threshold default 0.50).
  - Medium confidence → okay to apply threshold, but log the prediction and monitor.
  - Low confidence → abstain or apply conservative default (Not Transported) if you wish to reduce false positives; otherwise flag for review.
- Use frequent recalibration: after every 50–100 new labeled rows, recompute k and weight schedule and evaluate calibration (calibration plot; Brier score).

I. Consistency improvements across batch predictions
- Batch post-processing rules (apply after single-pass scoring):
  - For each group ID:
    - If any member has a known true label → apply family override as specified (≥2 labels & ≥67% agreement forces all).
    - If only predictions exist → compute group_mean_p = mean(p_final of group). If group_mean_p ≥ 0.80 or ≤ 0.20 apply consensus; if 0.20 < mean < 0.80 apply group smoothing (pull each member’s logit 20% toward group_mean_logit).
  - Order-independence: compute all initial p_final independently, then apply group reconciliation in one deterministic pass.
- Persist "adjusted" flag and explainability fields (top 3 contributing features, support_total, whether group override applied).

J. Handling edge cases like Philda (concrete rules)
- If a passenger is a child (1–17) and the only child in group and not CryoSleep and spending >1000 → require extra evidence (support_total >= 0.05) before predicting True. Otherwise default to False/abstain.
- For destinations with n ≤ 5 (low sample), apply stronger shrinkage (increase k locally) or treat destination as neutral until more data.
- For very high single-amenity spends (outliers), compute per-amenity percentiles and treat outlier-flag as a separate binary feature (reduces influence of one large VRDeck entry).

K. Monitoring, metrics and rollout plan
- Immediate steps:
  1. Implement the new scoring pipeline (shrinkage, reliability-weighted weights, logit combine).
  2. Implement support_total and low-confidence abstain or conservative default.
  3. Recompute smoothed p_i and per-value counts regularly (daily for active labeling).
- Monitoring (continuous):
  - Track Brier score, calibration curve, precision/recall, and confusion matrix per-week.
  - Monitor per-feature error rates (e.g., false positive rate among Deck F passengers).
  - Trigger re-fit/re-weighting when cumulative new labeled rows ≥ 50 (or sooner for critical errors).
- Evaluation:
  - Run leave-one-out evaluation on the current 21-row set to get an initial sense of in-sample behaviour; then expand with new labels and run cross-validation on ≥100 rows.

L. Implementation checklist (production-ready)
- Preprocessing:
  - Parse Cabin → Deck / Number / Side.
  - Compute TotalSpend, treat NaN as 0 but flag missing.
  - Extract group ID prefix (prior to “_”).
  - Bin Age and TotalSpend, and compute per-amenity percentiles.
- Prediction pipeline:
  1. Compute p0 and per-value smoothed tables (persist counts).
  2. For each passenger compute p_i_shrunk for available features with k=5.
  3. Compute reliability-scaled weights; combine in logit space to get p_final.
  4. Compute support_total and confidence category.
  5. Apply group reconciliation rules.
  6. If confidence low and p_final borderline → abstain or default to Not Transported.
  7. Log prediction, p_final, confidence, top-3 contributors, and reconciliation decisions.
- Ops:
  - Maintain a small audit table of all predictions and outcomes to support incremental updates and recalibration.

M. Recommended immediate next steps (prioritized)
1. Implement the new scoring formula + abstain/default rule in the production pipeline before the next batch.
2. Enable logging of top contributors and support_total for every prediction (essential for rapid root-cause analysis of future errors).
3. Start collecting more labeled rows and commit to re-fitting weights after every +50 labels; with ≥100–200 rows move to logistic/regularized models and isotonic/Platt calibration.
4. If you want, I can produce an exact, minimal Python function that implements the new scoring formula, group reconciliation and the abstain rule (includes parsing, Laplace smoothing, shrinkage, reliability scaling, and reporting of p_final + confidence). I can also run a leave-one-out evaluation on the 21-row set if you want quick in-sample stats.

N. Final note — practical policy recommendation for this small-data regime
- With very small training sets, it's safer to bias toward conservative predictions for uncertain cases. Implement the low-confidence abstain/default-to-not-transported rule described above. That single policy will reduce false positives like Philda while we accumulate more labeled data to learn finer-grained interactions.

Would you like:
- (A) A compact Python implementation of the new scoring+abstain pipeline (ready to drop into your batch code), or
- (B) A leave-one-out evaluation on the updated 21-row sample to estimate in-sample accuracy under the new rules, or
- (C) Both?
