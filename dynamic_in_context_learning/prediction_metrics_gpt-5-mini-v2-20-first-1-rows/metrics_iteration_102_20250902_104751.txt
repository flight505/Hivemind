PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 102
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: VRDeck ≥ 1,500 OR VIP == True OR RoomService ≥ 2,000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → Transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → 10% transport probability (high support)
- VIP == True → 15% transport probability (high support)
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → 85% transport probability (high support)
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 → 20% transport probability (medium support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- VIP == True → Not transported (confidence: high)
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → Transported (confidence: high)
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
