PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 141
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 45%
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → 75% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)
- CryoSleep == True AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → 80% transport probability (medium–high support)  ← new
- CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → 10% transport probability (high support)

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep == True → Transported (confidence: high) — overrides default/no-rule negative prediction
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → Transported (confidence: medium) — continues to override zero-spend rule
- CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Default / no rule triggered → Not transported (confidence: medium)
