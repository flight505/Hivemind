PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 82
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: RoomService ≥ 1000 OR TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: RoomService ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall ≥ 300 → Not transported (confidence: medium)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- RoomService ≥ 1000 → 10% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → 5% transport probability (high support)
- RoomService ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall ≥ 300 → 10% transport probability (medium support)  ← new
- Spa ≥ 500 → 10% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 25% transport probability (medium support)
- FoodCourt ≥ 2000 → 75% transport probability (medium support)
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False & FoodCourt < 2000 → 20% transport probability (medium support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- RoomService ≥ 1000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- RoomService ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall ≥ 300 → Not transported (confidence: medium)  ← new
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Spa ≥ 500 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- FoodCourt ≥ 2000 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False & FoodCourt < 2000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)

Rationale (concise): adding the combined RoomService+ShoppingMall threshold captures the 0108_02 profile (562 + 326 = 888) and flips its prediction to Not transported while leaving higher-threshold rules unchanged.
