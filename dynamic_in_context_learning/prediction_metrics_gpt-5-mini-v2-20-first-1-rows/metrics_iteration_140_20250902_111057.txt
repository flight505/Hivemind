PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 140
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1 (priority): Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → Transported (confidence: medium)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 45% (was 55%)
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → 75% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → 10% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → Transported (confidence: medium) — overrides zero-spend rule
- CryoSleep == False AND total_onboard_spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Default / no rule triggered → Not transported (confidence: medium) — (baseline <50% fixes 0181_01)
