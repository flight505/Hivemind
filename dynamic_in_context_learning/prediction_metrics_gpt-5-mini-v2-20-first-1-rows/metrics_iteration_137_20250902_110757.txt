PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 137
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND (RoomService ≥ 200 OR Spa ≥ 100 OR VRDeck ≥ 150 OR (total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 200)) → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 55%  
- CryoSleep == True AND any spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Europa → 70% (medium)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Mars → 65% (medium)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet not in {Europa, Mars} → 70% (medium)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND (ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 200) → 80% transport probability (medium support)  <-- new/adjusted  
- CryoSleep == False AND RoomService ≥ 1000 → 5% transport probability (high)  
- CryoSleep == False AND (RoomService ≥ 200 OR Spa ≥ 100 OR VRDeck ≥ 150 OR (total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 200)) → 10% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND (ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 200) → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- CryoSleep == False AND (RoomService ≥ 200 OR Spa ≥ 100 OR VRDeck ≥ 150 OR (total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 200)) → Not transported (confidence: high)

These minimal changes carve out high ShoppingMall/FoodCourt spend as an exception to the previous "high total spend → not transported" rule and will correct the shown error.
