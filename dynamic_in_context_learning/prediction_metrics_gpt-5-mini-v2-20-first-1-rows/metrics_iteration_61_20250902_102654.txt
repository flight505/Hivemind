PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 61
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  (unchanged)
- Rule 2: (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 OR (VRDeck ≥ 500 AND TotalSpend ≥ 1500)) → Transported (confidence: medium)  (VRDeck case now requires sufficient overall spend)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 OR (VRDeck ≥ 500 AND TotalSpend ≥ 1500)) → 85% transport probability (medium support)
- VRDeck ≥ 500 AND TotalSpend < 1500 → 30% transport probability (low support)  ← new/adjusted
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 & Age ≥ 30 → 65% transport probability (medium support)  (unchanged exception)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 (general) → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → 70% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → 12% transport probability (medium support)
- Age ≥ 60 → 10% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 OR (VRDeck ≥ 500 AND TotalSpend ≥ 1500)) → Transported (confidence: medium)
- VRDeck ≥ 500 alone with TotalSpend < 1500 → lower transport likelihood (~30%) (confidence: low)  ← prevents the false positive in 0086_01
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 & Age ≥ 30 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Notes: Only adjusted the high-transport pattern to require meaningful total spend when VRDeck alone is elevated (and added a lowered transport probability for VRDeck-high but low-total-spend cases). Other rules/precedence unchanged.
