PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 8
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: Cabin deck D → Transported = False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 AND Age > 10 → Transported = True (confidence: high)  (unchanged)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (unchanged)
- Cabin deck D → 25% transport probability (new; low-to-medium support)
- Cabin deck F → 80% (unchanged)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 → 83% (5/6) (unchanged from prior update)
- TotalSpend = 0 → 71% (5/7) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True → 80% (4/5) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → 0% (0/1) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend > 0 → 100% (4/4) (unchanged)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% (8/11) (unchanged)
- VIP = True → 0% (0/1) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- Cabin deck D → not transported (confidence: medium; can override spend-driven signals for D passengers)
- TotalSpend = 0 AND Age ≤ 10 → Not transported (confidence: medium‑low; unchanged)
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 (Age > 10) → Transported (confidence: high)
- Shared group ID → members usually share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7 observed; confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 AND TotalSpend > 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (confidence: medium)

(Only the cabin‑D rule/probability was added/changed to correct 0022_01; other metrics retained.)
