PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 60
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 AND Age ≥ 30 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (higher precedence than the general CryoSleep & TotalSpend=0 rule)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 & Age ≥ 30 → 65% transport probability (medium support)  ← new/exception
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 (general, when no exception above applies) → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → 70% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 30 (applies when Age ≥ 5) → 55% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend > 0 → 8% transport probability (high support)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000) → 85% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → 12% transport probability (medium support)
- Age ≥ 60 → 10% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 & Age ≥ 30 → Transported (confidence: medium)  ← new / higher precedence
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Not transported (confidence: medium) (lower precedence)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000) → Transported (confidence: medium)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Notes: Only added a single higher-precedence exception for adult cryosleep passengers with zero spend (Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend = 0) to correct the false-negative cases; other rules/precedence remain unchanged.
