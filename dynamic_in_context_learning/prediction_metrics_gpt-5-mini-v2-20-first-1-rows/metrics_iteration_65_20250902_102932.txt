PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 65
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  (unchanged)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (unchanged)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 65% transport probability (medium support)
- FoodCourt ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False → 25% transport probability (medium support)  (new — addresses 0091_02)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (unchanged)
- FoodCourt ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False → Not transported (confidence: medium)  (new — fixes 0091_02)
