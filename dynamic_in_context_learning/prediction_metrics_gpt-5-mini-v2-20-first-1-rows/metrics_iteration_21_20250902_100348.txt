PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 21
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = True → Transported = False (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: (FoodCourt + Spa + VRDeck) > 900 OR VRDeck > 350 → Transported = False (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65%
- CryoSleep = True → 8% transport probability (high support)
- (FoodCourt + Spa + VRDeck) > 900 → 10% transport probability (high support)
- VRDeck > 350 → 12% transport probability (medium-high support)
- FoodCourt > 800 → 12% transport probability (medium support)
- RoomService / TotalSpend > 0.7 → 10% transport probability (medium support)
- RoomService > 1000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend > 5,000 → 15% transport probability (medium support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep True → Not transported (confidence: high)
- High non-roomservice leisure spend (FoodCourt + Spa + VRDeck > 900 OR VRDeck > 350) → Not transported (confidence: high)
- RoomService-dominant spend (RoomService / TotalSpend > 0.7 or RoomService > 1000) → Not transported (confidence: medium-high)

Note: Rule priority should place CryoSleep check before baseline/other spend-based rules so passengers like 0039_01 are correctly predicted as Not transported.
