PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 57
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND Age < 5 → Transported (confidence: medium)  ← new; higher precedence than CryoSleep & TotalSpend=0

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 8% transport probability (medium support) (now lower precedence than CryoSleep & Age < 5)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → 70% transport probability (medium support)  ← added to fix the error for very young cryosleep passengers
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 30 → 55% transport probability (medium support) (applies when Age ≥ 5)
- CryoSleep = True & Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend > 0 → 8% transport probability (high support)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000) → 85% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → 12% transport probability (medium support)
- Age ≥ 60 → 10% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → Transported (confidence: medium)  ← new/overrides CryoSleep & TotalSpend=0
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Not transported (confidence: medium) (lower precedence)
- (TotalSpend < 5000) AND (FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000) → Transported (confidence: medium)
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Reason: add a higher-priority rule for very young cryosleep passengers (Age < 5) so CryoSleep=True with zero spend and very young age is predicted transported, fixing the shown error while leaving other cryosleep/TotalSpend behavior intact.
