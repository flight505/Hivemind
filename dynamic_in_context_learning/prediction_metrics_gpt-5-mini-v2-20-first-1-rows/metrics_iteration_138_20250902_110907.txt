PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 138
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 55%  
- CryoSleep == True AND any spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → 10% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND (ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 200) → 80% transport probability (medium support)  
- CryoSleep == False AND (RoomService ≥ 200 OR Spa ≥ 100 OR VRDeck ≥ 150 OR (total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 200)) → 10% transport probability (high support)

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend ≥ 500 AND (ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 200) → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- CryoSleep == False AND (high RoomService/Spa/VRDeck OR high total spend with low Mall/FoodCourt) → Not transported (confidence: high)

These minimal updates ensure a CryoSleep==False passenger with zero onboard spending (e.g., 0179_02) is predicted Not transported.
