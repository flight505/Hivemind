PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 119
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True AND (TotalSpend > 0 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 400 OR RoomService > 0 OR VRDeck > 0) → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: VRDeck ≥ 1,500 OR VIP == True OR RoomService ≥ 2,000 OR (TotalSpend < 500 AND CryoSleep == False) OR (CryoSleep == True AND TotalSpend == 0 AND RoomService == 0 AND FoodCourt == 0 AND ShoppingMall == 0 AND VRDeck == 0) → Not transported (confidence: high)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 60%  
- CryoSleep == True AND any spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 (TotalSpend == 0, RoomService==0, FoodCourt==0, ShoppingMall==0, VRDeck==0) → 8% transport probability (high support)  
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → 10% transport probability (high support)  
- VIP == True → 15% transport probability (high support)  
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)  
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 → 80% transport probability (high support)  
- FoodCourt ≥ 400 → 75% transport probability (medium-high support)  
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → 85% transport probability (high support)  
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 400 → 40% transport probability (medium support)  
- TotalSpend < 500 AND CryoSleep == False → 5% transport probability (high support)

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all onboard spends == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- VIP == True → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)  
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- FoodCourt ≥ 400 → Transported (confidence: medium-high)  
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 400 → Not transported (confidence: medium)

Notes: Only change made is conditioning the CryoSleep → Transport signal on non‑zero spends (with an explicit exception for all-zero spend CryoSleep passengers). This fixes the 0151_01 false positive while preserving prior fixes that required CryoSleep to indicate transport when accompanied by spending.
