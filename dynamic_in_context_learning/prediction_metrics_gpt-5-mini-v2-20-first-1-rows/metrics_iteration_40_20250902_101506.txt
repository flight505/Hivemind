PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 40
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- Rule 2: Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 55% transport probability (medium support)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 30 → 55% transport probability (medium support) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True & Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend > 0 → 8% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)
- Age ≥ 60 → 10% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True & Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend > 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 30 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

(Only the CryoSleep + zero-total-spend rule/probability was changed to fix the error.)
