PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 139
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1 (priority): Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 55%  
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → 75% transport probability (medium support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → 10% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- Age <= 4 AND CryoSleep == False → Transported (confidence: medium) — (overrides zero-spend rule)  
- CryoSleep == False AND total onboard spend == 0 → Not transported (confidence: high)

This minimal change ensures passenger 0179_03 (age 3, zero spend) is predicted Transported.
