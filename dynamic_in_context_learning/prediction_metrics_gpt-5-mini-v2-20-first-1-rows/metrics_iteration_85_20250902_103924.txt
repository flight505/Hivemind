============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: RoomService ≥ 1000 OR TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: VRDeck ≥ 1500 → Not transported (confidence: medium)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60% (unchanged)
- VRDeck ≥ 1500 → 10% transport probability (medium support)
- (Other listed probabilities remain as previously stated.)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- VRDeck ≥ 1500 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- (All other critical patterns unchanged.)

This change flips passenger 0110_02 (VRDeck = 1687) to Not transported, addressing the error.
