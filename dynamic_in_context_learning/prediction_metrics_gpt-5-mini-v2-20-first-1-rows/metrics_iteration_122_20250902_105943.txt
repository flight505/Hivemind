PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 122
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True AND (TotalSpend > 0 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 400 OR RoomService > 0 OR VRDeck > 0) → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == True AND TotalSpend == 0 AND RoomService == 0 AND FoodCourt == 0 AND ShoppingMall == 0 AND VRDeck == 0 AND HomePlanet == Europa → Transported (confidence: medium)  
(Existing rule "CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 → Not transported" remains but is now applied only when HomePlanet != Europa.)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%  
- CryoSleep == True AND any spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Europa → 70% transport probability (medium support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet != Europa → 8% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all onboard spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Europa → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all onboard spends == 0 AND HomePlanet != Europa → Not transported (confidence: high)

Reason: added a minimal Europa exception for all-zero-spend CryoSleep passengers to correct 0163_01 while preserving prior CryoSleep spend-based behavior.
