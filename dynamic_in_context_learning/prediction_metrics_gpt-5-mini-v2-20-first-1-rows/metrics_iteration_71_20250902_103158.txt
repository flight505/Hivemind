PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 71
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: FoodCourt ≥ 2000 → Transported (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 60%  
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 65% transport probability (medium support)  
- FoodCourt ≥ 2000 → 75% transport probability (medium support)  (new/adjusted)  
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False & FoodCourt < 2000 → 20% transport probability (medium support)  (modified)

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- FoodCourt ≥ 2000 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (new)  
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 & CryoSleep = False & FoodCourt < 2000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)  (modified)  
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)

These minimal adjustments ensure the 0098_02 case (FoodCourt=2811) is predicted as Transported.
