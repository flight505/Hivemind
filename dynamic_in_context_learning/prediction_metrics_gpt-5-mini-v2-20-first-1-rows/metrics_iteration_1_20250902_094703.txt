PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 1
============================================================

**Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = True → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: Cabin deck = F → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 3: HomePlanet = Earth → Transported = True (confidence: medium)
- Rule 4: Total spend = 0 (RoomService+FoodCourt+ShoppingMall+Spa+VRDeck) → Transported = True (confidence: medium)
- Rule 5: VIP = True → Transported = False (confidence: low)
- Rule 6: Cabin deck = A → Transported = False (confidence: medium)

**Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (13/20)
- CryoSleep: True → 100% transport probability (4/4)
- Cabin deck F → 80% transport probability (8/10)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% transport probability (8/11)
- Total spend = 0 → 83% transport probability (5/6)
- VIP = True → 0% transport probability (0/1)

**Critical Patterns:**
- Shared group ID (same family/group) → members share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7) (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True → transported (confidence: high)
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (2/2) (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (0/2) (confidence: medium)
