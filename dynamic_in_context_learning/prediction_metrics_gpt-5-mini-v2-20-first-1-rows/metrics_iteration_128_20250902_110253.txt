PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 128
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True AND (TotalSpend > 0 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 400 OR RoomService > 0 OR VRDeck > 0) → Transported (confidence: high)  
- Rule 2: CryoSleep == False AND RoomService ≥ 1000 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%  
- CryoSleep == True AND any spend > 0 → 90% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Europa → 70% transport probability (medium support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet == Mars → 65% transport probability (medium support)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all spends == 0 AND HomePlanet not in {Europa, Mars} → 8% transport probability (high support)  
- CryoSleep == False AND RoomService ≥ 1000 → 5% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep == True AND any onboard spend > 0 → Transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep == True AND all onboard spends == 0 AND HomePlanet ∈ {Europa, Mars} → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- CryoSleep == False AND RoomService ≥ 1000 → Not transported (confidence: high)
