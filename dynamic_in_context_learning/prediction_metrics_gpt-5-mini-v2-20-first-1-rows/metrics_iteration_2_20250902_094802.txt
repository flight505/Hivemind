PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 2
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Transported = False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 → Transported = True (confidence: medium)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (13/20) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep: True → 80% transport probability (4/5) (updated)
- Cabin deck F → 80% transport probability (8/10)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% transport probability (8/11)
- Total spend = 0 → 83% transport probability (5/6)
- VIP = True → 0% transport probability (0/1)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- Shared group ID → members share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7) (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True (Age > 2) → transported (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (2/2) (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (0/2) (confidence: medium)
