PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 7
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend = 0 AND Age ≤ 10 → Transported = False (confidence: medium‑low — new exception)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 AND Age > 10 → Transported = True (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (13/20) — unchanged
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 → 83% (5/6) (downgraded from 100% due to the new exception)
- TotalSpend = 0 → 71% (5/7) (downgraded from 83%)
- Age ≤ 10 AND TotalSpend = 0 → 0% (0/1) (new; very limited support)
- CryoSleep = True → 80% (4/5) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → 0% (0/1) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend > 0 → 100% (4/4) (unchanged)
- Cabin deck F → 80% (8/10) (unchanged)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% (8/11) (unchanged)
- VIP = True → 0% (0/1) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend = 0 AND Age ≤ 10 → Not transported (confidence: medium‑low; overrides zero‑spend rule for young children)
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 (Age > 10) → Transported (confidence: high)
- Shared group ID → members usually share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7 observed; confidence: medium; not absolute)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 AND TotalSpend > 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (confidence: medium)

Notes: Added a small‑sample exception for young, zero‑spend passengers to correct 0020_06 (Age 7, TotalSpend 0). This reduces the blanket confidence in the "CryoSleep=False & TotalSpend=0 → transported" rule and prevents the misprediction.
