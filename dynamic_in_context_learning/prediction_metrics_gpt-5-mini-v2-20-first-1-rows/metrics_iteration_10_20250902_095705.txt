PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 10
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: Cabin deck D → Transported = False (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- Rule 2: Cabin deck F AND Age < 18 → Transported = False (confidence: medium) (new — fixes 0025_01)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (unchanged)
- Cabin deck F → 80% transport probability (for adults; unchanged)
- Cabin deck F AND Age < 18 → 20% transport probability (new; medium support)
- CryoSleep = True → 80% (4/5) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → 50% (1/2) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend > 0 → 100% (4/4) (unchanged)
- Cabin deck D → 25% transport probability (unchanged)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 → 83% (5/6) (unchanged)
- TotalSpend = 0 → 71% (5/7) (unchanged)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% (8/11) (unchanged)
- VIP = True → 0% (0/1) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep = True AND Age > 10 → Transported (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- Cabin deck D → Not transported (can override spend-driven signals for D passengers) (confidence: medium) (unchanged)
- Cabin deck F AND Age < 18 → Not transported (confidence: medium) (new)
