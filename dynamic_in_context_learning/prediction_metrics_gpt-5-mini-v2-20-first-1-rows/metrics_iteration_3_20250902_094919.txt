PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 3
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Transported = False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 AND TotalSpend > 0 → Transported = True (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (13/20) (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True → 80% transport probability (4/5) (overall, unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → 0% transport probability (0/1) (updated)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend > 0 → 100% transport probability (4/4) (updated)
- Cabin deck F → 80% transport probability (8/10)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% transport probability (8/11)
- Total spend = 0 → 83% transport probability (5/6) (note: exception when CryoSleep = True)
- VIP = True → 0% transport probability (0/1)

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- Shared group ID → members share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7) (confidence: high)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 AND TotalSpend > 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → Not transported (confidence: medium)  ← fixes error for 0020_02
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (2/2) (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (0/2) (confidence: medium)
