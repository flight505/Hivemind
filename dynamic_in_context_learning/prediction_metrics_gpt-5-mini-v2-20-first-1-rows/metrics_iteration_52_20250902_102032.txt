PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 52
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- Rule 2: Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%  
- FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 → 85% transport probability (medium support)  
- ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 → 85% transport probability (medium support)  ← NEW  
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → 12% transport probability (medium support)  ← adjusted to include ShoppingMall check  
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 55% transport probability (medium support) (unchanged)  
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 30 → 55% transport probability (medium support) (unchanged)  
- CryoSleep = True & Age ≥ 30 & TotalSpend > 0 → 8% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)  
- Age ≥ 60 → 10% transport probability (high support) (unchanged)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- FoodCourt ≥ 1000 OR VRDeck ≥ 500 OR ShoppingMall ≥ 1000 → Transported (confidence: medium)  
- TotalSpend ≥ 800 AND FoodCourt < 1000 AND VRDeck < 500 AND ShoppingMall < 1000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)  
- Age ≥ 60 → Not transported (confidence: high)  
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
