PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 5
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: Shared group ID → members usually share Transported label (confidence: medium)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 65% (13/20)
- CryoSleep = True → 80% (4/5)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → 0% (0/1)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend > 0 → 100% (4/4)
- CryoSleep = False AND TotalSpend = 0 → 100% (5/5)  ← new / promoted
- Total spend = 0 → 83% (5/6) (note: exception when CryoSleep = True)
- Cabin deck F → 80% (8/10)
- HomePlanet = Earth → 73% (8/11)
- VIP = True → 0% (0/1)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend = 0 AND CryoSleep = False → transported (confidence: high)
- Shared group ID → members share Transported label (3 groups, 7/7 observed; confidence: medium; not absolute)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age ≤ 2 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND Age > 2 AND TotalSpend > 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)
- CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- Cabin deck F → transported (confidence: high)
- Cabin deck A → not transported (confidence: medium)
- Spa > 3000 → not transported (confidence: medium)

Effect: 0020_04 (CryoSleep=False, TotalSpend=0) will now be predicted Transported = True.
