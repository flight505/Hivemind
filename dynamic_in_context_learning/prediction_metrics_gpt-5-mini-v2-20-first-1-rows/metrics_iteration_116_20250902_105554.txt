PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 116
============================================================

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: CryoSleep == True OR ShoppingMall ≥ 500 OR FoodCourt ≥ 400 OR (TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000) → Transported (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: VRDeck ≥ 1,500 OR VIP == True OR RoomService ≥ 2,000 OR (TotalSpend < 500 AND CryoSleep == False) → Not transported (confidence: high)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- CryoSleep == True → 90% transport probability (high support)
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → 10% transport probability (high support)
- VIP == True → 15% transport probability (high support)
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → 8% transport probability (medium support)
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 → 80% transport probability (high support)
- FoodCourt ≥ 400 → 75% transport probability (medium-high support)
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → 85% transport probability (high support)
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 → 40% transport probability (medium support)
- TotalSpend < 500 AND CryoSleep == False → 5% transport probability (high support)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- CryoSleep == True → Transported (confidence: high)
- VRDeck ≥ 1,500 → Not transported (confidence: high)
- VIP == True → Not transported (confidence: high)
- RoomService ≥ 2,000 → Not transported (confidence: medium)
- TotalSpend < 500 AND CryoSleep == False → Not transported (confidence: high)
- ShoppingMall ≥ 500 → Transported (confidence: high)
- FoodCourt ≥ 400 → Transported (confidence: medium-high)
- TotalSpend ≥ 2,000 AND VRDeck < 1,500 AND VIP == False AND RoomService < 2,000 → Transported (confidence: high)
- TotalSpend 500–1,999 AND ShoppingMall < 500 AND FoodCourt < 400 → Not transported (confidence: medium)

Essential change: CryoSleep True now explicitly signals transport and overrides the TotalSpend < 500 not-transport rule, which fixes the 0147_01 error.
