PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 64
============================================================

Updated predictive metrics (minimal change to fix error 0091_01):

Updated Predictive Rules:
- Rule 1: TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  (unchanged)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep = True AND TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (upgraded from low/rare)

Updated Key Probabilities:
- Baseline transport rate: 60%
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → 65% transport probability (medium support)  (was 8%)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → 70% transport probability (medium support)  (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 & Age ≥ 30 → 65% transport probability (medium support)  (unchanged)
(Other previously reported probabilities remain as before.)

Updated Critical Patterns:
- TotalSpend ≥ 5000 → Not transported (confidence: high)  (unchanged)
- CryoSleep = True & TotalSpend = 0 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (new/updated — fixes 0091_01)
- CryoSleep = True & Age < 5 → Transported (confidence: medium)  (unchanged)

Only the CryoSleep-with-zero-spend rule was elevated to correct the false negative; other rules/precedence unchanged.
