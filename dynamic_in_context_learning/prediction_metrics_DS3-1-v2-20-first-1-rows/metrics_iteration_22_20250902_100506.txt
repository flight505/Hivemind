PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 22
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 2: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)  // Confidence remains low due to persistent errors

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 40% transport probability  // Increased from 30% based on additional error cases

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported False with low confidence  // Unchanged but note reduced reliability
