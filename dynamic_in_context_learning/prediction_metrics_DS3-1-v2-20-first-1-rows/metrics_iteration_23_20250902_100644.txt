PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 23
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)  // New rule based on error case
- Rule 2: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)  // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50%  // Assumed baseline for reference
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 → 20% transport probability  // Decreased based on error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with high spends → Transported False with low confidence  // Added pattern for improved coverage
