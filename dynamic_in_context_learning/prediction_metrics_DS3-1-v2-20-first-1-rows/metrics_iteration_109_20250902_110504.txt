PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 109
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 17: CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → Predict False (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 18: CryoSleep True and (total spend == 0 or total spend is NaN) → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 19: CryoSleep False and total spend <= 7500 and total spend > 500 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Refined to exclude very low spend
- Rule 20: CryoSleep False and total spend <= 500 → Predict True (confidence: low) // Added for low-spend non-Cryo cases

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → 5% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 85% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 7500 and total spend > 500 → 20% transported probability // Adjusted lower based on error
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 500 → 60% transported probability // Added for low-spend cases

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with very high total spend (>7500) → Predict False with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True with zero or missing total spend → Predict True with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False with moderate/high total spend (>500 and <=7500) → Predict False with medium confidence // Adjusted threshold
- CryoSleep False with very low total spend (<=500) → Predict True with low confidence // Added new pattern
