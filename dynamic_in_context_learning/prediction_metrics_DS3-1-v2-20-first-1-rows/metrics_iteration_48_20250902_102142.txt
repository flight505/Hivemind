PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 48
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium) // New rule for high spend
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: medium) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 52% transport probability // Decreased from 55% to 52%
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 2000 → 35% transport probability // Added high-spend exception

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with total spend > 2000 → Predict False with medium confidence, regardless of age
- Age ≤ 50 with moderate spend (≤2000) → Slightly favors True, but with very low confidence
