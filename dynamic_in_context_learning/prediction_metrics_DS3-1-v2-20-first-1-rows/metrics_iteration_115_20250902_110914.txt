PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 115
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 17: CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → Predict False (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 18: CryoSleep True → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 19: CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 and total spend <= 7500 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 20: CryoSleep False and total spend <= 1000 → Predict False (confidence: low) // Changed prediction from True to False due to error case with zero spend

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → 5% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True → 85% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 and total spend <= 7500 → 20% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 1000 → 40% transported probability // Lowered from 60% to reflect reduced likelihood based on error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with very high total spend (>7500) → Predict False with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True → Predict True with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False with low total spend (<=1000) → Predict False with low confidence // Changed from Predict True due to error
- CryoSleep False with moderate total spend (>1000 and <=7500) → Predict False with medium confidence // Unchanged
