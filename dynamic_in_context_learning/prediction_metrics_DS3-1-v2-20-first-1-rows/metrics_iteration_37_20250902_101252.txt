PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 37
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 3: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 and Age > 30 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low) // No change
- Rule 4: CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 and Age ≤ 5 → Predict Transported True (confidence: low) // No change
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: very low) // Confidence lowered due to error

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 25% transport probability // No change
- CryoSleep True, total spend = 0, Age > 30 → 25% transport probability // No change
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 55% transport probability // Reduced from 60% due to error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported outcome varies by age; low confidence for adults // No change
- CryoSleep False with non-zero spends → Transported outcome uncertain; very low confidence // Confidence lowered
