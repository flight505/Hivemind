PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 33
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 and Age ≤ 5 → Predict Transported True (confidence: medium)
- Rule 3: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 and Age > 5 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)
- Rule 4: CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 and Age ≤ 5 → Predict Transported True (confidence: low)  // New rule based on error

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50%
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 1000 → 20% transport probability
- CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 → 40% transport probability  // New probability based on error
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 20% transport probability
- CryoSleep True, total spend = 0, Age ≤ 5 → 70% transport probability
- CryoSleep True, total spend = 0, Age > 5 → 30% transport probability
- CryoSleep False, total spend = 0, Age ≤ 5 → 60% transport probability  // Adjusted for rule 4

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with high spends → Transported False with low confidence
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported False for Age > 5 with low confidence, Transported True for Age ≤ 5 with medium confidence
- CryoSleep False with zero spends → Transported True for Age ≤ 5 with low confidence  // New pattern based on error
