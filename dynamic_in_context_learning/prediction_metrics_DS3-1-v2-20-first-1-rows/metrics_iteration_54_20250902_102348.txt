PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 54
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and Age ≤ 30 → Predict True (confidence: high) // Sharpened focus to younger ages
- Rule 8: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and 30 < Age ≤ 50 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // New rule covering this error case
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict True (confidence: medium) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and 30 < Age ≤ 50 → 30% transport probability // New probability based on error case
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 2000, Age ≤ 30 → 60% transport probability // Increased confidence

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- Age 31-50 with high spend and no CryoSleep → Predict False with increasing frequency // New critical pattern based on this error
