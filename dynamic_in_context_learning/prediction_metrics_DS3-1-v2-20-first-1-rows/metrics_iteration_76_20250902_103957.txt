PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 76
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 8: CryoSleep False and total spend (with missing values imputed as 0) <= 20 → Predict True (confidence: medium) // Added to handle low spend cases

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 98% transport probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 20 → 65% transport probability // Added for better accuracy

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spend, even with missing data → Predict True with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False with low spend (<=20) → Predict True with medium confidence // Added to address error cases
