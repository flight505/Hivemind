PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 34
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 3: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 and Age > 30 → Predict Transported False (confidence: very low) // Lowered confidence due to error
- Rule 4: CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 and Age ≤ 5 → Predict Transported True (confidence: low) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 25% transport probability // Increased from 20% due to error evidence
- CryoSleep True, total spend = 0, Age > 30 → 25% transport probability // Adjusted for clarity

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported outcome varies by age; low confidence for adults
