PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 3
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep is True and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep is True and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: high)  // Increased confidence from medium to high
- Rule 3: CryoSleep is False → Predict Transported True (confidence: low)
- Rule 4: CryoSleep is False and total spend > 5000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 64%
- CryoSleep: True → 95% transport probability
- CryoSleep: False → 55% transport probability
- Total spend > 5000 → 33% transport probability
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 10% transport probability  // Added based on error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported False with high confidence  // Increased from medium
- High total spend (>5000) with CryoSleep False → Transported False with medium confidence
- CryoSleep False with total spend ≤ 5000 → Transported True with low confidence
