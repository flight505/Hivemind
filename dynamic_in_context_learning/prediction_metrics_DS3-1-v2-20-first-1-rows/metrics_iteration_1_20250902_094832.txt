PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 1
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep is True → Predict Transported True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep is False → Predict Transported True (confidence: low)  // Added general rule for uncovered cases
- Rule 3: CryoSleep is False and total spend > 5000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)  // Retained with higher priority over Rule 2

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 64%  // Slightly decreased due to error
- CryoSleep: True → 100% transport probability
- CryoSleep: False → 55% transport probability  // Adjusted downward based on error
- Total spend > 5000 → 33% transport probability

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported True with high confidence
- High total spend (>5000) with CryoSleep False → Transported False with medium confidence
- CryoSleep False with total spend ≤ 5000 → Transported True with low confidence  // Added pattern based on error
