PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 78
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age > 12 → Predict True (confidence: medium) // Added age constraint to exclude minors
- Rule 9: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age <= 12 → Predict False (confidence: high) // New rule for minors with zero spend

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age > 12 → 85% transport probability // Reduced confidence
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age <= 12 → 5% transport probability // Added exception

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with explicit zero spend and Age <= 12 → Predict False with high confidence // New critical pattern for minors
