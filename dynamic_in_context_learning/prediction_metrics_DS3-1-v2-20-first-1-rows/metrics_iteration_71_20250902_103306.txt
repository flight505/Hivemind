PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 71
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and Age ≤ 30 → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 8: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and 30 < Age ≤ 50 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 9: CryoSleep False and total spend <= 2000 and Age ≤ 30 → Predict False (confidence: low) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and 30 < Age ≤ 50 → 30% transport probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 and Age ≤ 30 → 70% transport probability // Increased from 60% to 70% due to error
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 95% transport probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 2000 and Age ≤ 30 → 40% transport probability // Unchanged

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- Age 31-50 with high spend and no CryoSleep → Predict False with increasing frequency // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True with zero spend → Predict True with high confidence // Unchanged
- Age ≤ 30 with high spend and CryoSleep False → Predict True with high confidence // Strengthened due to error
