PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 77
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged, but ensure explicit zero spend (not missing) is included
- Rule 8: CryoSleep False and total spend (with missing values imputed as 0) <= 20 → Predict True (confidence: medium) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 99% transport probability // Increased confidence due to error case
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 20 → 65% transport probability // Unchanged

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with explicit zero spend (all services 0.0) → Predict True with high confidence // Emphasized for clarity
- CryoSleep False with low spend (<=20) → Predict True with medium confidence // Unchanged
