PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 81
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age > 12 → Predict True (confidence: low) // Reduced confidence due to error
- Rule 9: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age <= 12 → Predict False (confidence: high) // No change
- Rule 10: CryoSleep NaN and total spend > 0 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // No change
- Rule 11: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // No change

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age > 12 → 70% transport probability // Reduced from 85% based on error
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 and Age <= 12 → 5% transport probability // No change
- CryoSleep NaN and total spend > 0 → 20% transport probability // No change
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 10% transport probability // No change

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with explicit zero spend and Age <= 12 → Predict False with high confidence // No change
- CryoSleep True with explicit zero spend and Age > 12 → Predict True with low confidence // New pattern reflecting reduced certainty
- CryoSleep NaN with non-zero spend → Predict False with medium confidence // No change
- CryoSleep False with non-zero spend → Predict False with medium confidence // No change
