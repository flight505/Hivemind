PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 46
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: low) // Increased from extremely low to low
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: medium) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 60% transport probability // Increased from 50% to 60%
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 0, Age > 50 → 40% transport probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 70% transport probability // Unchanged

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with non-zero spends → Transported probability higher for Age ≤ 50 (favoring True), lower for Age > 50 (favoring False with medium confidence)
