PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 17
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 2: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)  // Reduced confidence due to error

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 30% transport probability  // Increased from 20% based on error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported False with low confidence  // Reduced confidence due to error
