PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 9
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: CryoSleep True and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)  // Confidence lowered based on error
- Rule 3: CryoSleep False → Predict Transported True (confidence: low)
- Rule 4: CryoSleep False and total spend > 5000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and total spend <= 5000 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 64%
- CryoSleep True → 95% transport probability
- CryoSleep False → 55% transport probability
- Total spend > 5000 → 33% transport probability
- CryoSleep True and total spend = 0 → 20% transport probability  // Increased from 10% based on error
- CryoSleep False and total spend = 0 → 20% transport probability
- CryoSleep False and total spend between 0 and 5000 → 40% transport probability

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → Transported False with medium confidence  // Confidence lowered from high
- High total spend (>5000) with CryoSleep False → Transported False with medium confidence
- CryoSleep False with total spend ≤ 5000 and spend > 0 → Transported False with medium confidence
- CryoSleep False with total spend = 0 → Transported False with medium confidence
