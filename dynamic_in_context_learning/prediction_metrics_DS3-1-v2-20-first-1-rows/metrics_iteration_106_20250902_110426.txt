PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 106
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 17: CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → Predict False (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 18: CryoSleep True and (total spend == 0 or total spend is NaN) → Predict True (confidence: high) // Unchanged
- Rule 19: CryoSleep False and total spend <= 7500 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Added to cover moderate spend cases

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 7500 → 5% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 85% transported probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend <= 7500 → 30% transported probability // Added for better coverage

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with very high total spend (>7500) → Predict False with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep True with zero or missing total spend (NaN handled as 0) → Predict True with high confidence // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False with moderate total spend (<=7500) → Predict False with medium confidence // Added to address error case
