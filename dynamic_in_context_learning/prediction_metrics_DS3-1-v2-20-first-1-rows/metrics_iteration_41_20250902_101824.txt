PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 41
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: extremely low)
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict Transported False (confidence: medium) // Confidence increased from low to medium
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50%
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 50% transport probability
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 0, Age > 50 → 40% transport probability
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 70% transport probability

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with non-zero spends → Transported outcome uncertain; age > 50 lowers transport probability and increases confidence for predicting False
