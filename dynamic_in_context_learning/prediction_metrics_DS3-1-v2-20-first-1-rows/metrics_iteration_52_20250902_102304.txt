PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 52
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 2000 → Predict False (confidence: low) // Reduced confidence due to error case
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict False (confidence: medium) // Unchanged
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict True (confidence: medium) // Unchanged

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50% // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 52% transport probability // Unchanged
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 2000 → 40% transport probability // Increased from 35% to 40% to account for error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with total spend > 2000 → Predict False with low confidence // Updated confidence
- Age ≤ 50 with high spend (>2000) → Slightly higher transport probability trend, but low confidence // Added note based on error
