PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 39
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 5: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: extremely low)
- Rule 6: CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 and Age > 50 → Predict Transported False (confidence: low)
- Rule 7: CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → Predict Transported True (confidence: low) // New rule to address error

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 50%
- CryoSleep False and total spend > 0 → 50% transport probability
- CryoSleep False, total spend > 0, Age > 50 → 40% transport probability
- CryoSleep True and total spend == 0 → 70% transport probability // New probability based on error

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- CryoSleep False with non-zero spends → Transported outcome highly uncertain; age > 50 significantly lowers transport probability and confidence
- CryoSleep True with zero spends → High transport probability // New pattern based on error
