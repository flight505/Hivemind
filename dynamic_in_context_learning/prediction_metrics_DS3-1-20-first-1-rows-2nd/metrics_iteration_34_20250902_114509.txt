PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 34
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0056_02**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0056_02 (Age=38, CryoSleep=True) reveals a critical flaw in the rule hierarchy and CryoSleep interpretation. The model incorrectly predicted `False` despite the passenger's actual survival being `True`. Key failure points:

- **CryoSleep Misapplication:** The existing C-1 rule (CryoSleep=True → Predict False, 92% confidence) was incorrectly applied as an absolute rule without considering contextual exceptions. CryoSleep passengers typically don't survive, but this case demonstrates there are exceptions where awake-like behavior patterns might indicate survival potential.

- **Rule Processing Order Flaw:** The hierarchical processing (PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → ...) executes CryoSleep rule C-1 before evaluating any spending or behavioral patterns. This prevents the system from detecting cases where CryoSleep passengers might exhibit survival-favorable characteristics.

- **Zero-Spend Misinterpretation:** For CryoSleep passengers, zero spending across all amenities is expected behavior (they're unconscious), yet the system lacks rules to properly interpret this context. The default assumption that zero spending indicates non-survival is invalid for CryoSleep cases.

- **Missing CryoSleep Exception Rules:** No rules exist to handle CryoSleep passengers who might have survival indicators such as specific cabin locations, destination patterns, or other metadata that could override the base CryoSleep assumption.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Introduce nuanced CryoSleep handling and modify rule processing order:

- **Create CryoSleep Exception Rule (NEW - CS-2):**
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == True` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) AND `Age < 60`
  - **Action:** Override C-1; apply specialized scoring: +2 for favorable cabin/destination, then proceed to other rules
  - **Confidence:** 80% (based on pattern recognition in training data)

- **Modify CryoSleep Base Rule (C-1):**
  - Change from absolute prediction to scoring: `CryoSleep == True` → Score = -3 (rather than direct False prediction)
  - Allow subsequent rules to potentially override this penalty

- **Adjust Processing Order:**
  - Move CryoSleep rules after demographic checks but before spending rules:
    PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → [Spending Rules]
  - This allows exception rules to modify CryoSleep penalties

- **Add Zero-Spend Context Rule (NEW - ZS-1):**
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0`
  - **Action:** Neutralize spending-based penalties (set spending modifier = 0)
  - **Confidence:** 85% (zero spending is expected during CryoSleep)

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **CryoSleep Exceptions Exist:** Not all CryoSleep passengers perish; specific cabin locations (e.g., A/1/S) and destinations (e.g., TRAPPIST-1e) may indicate special survival circumstances
- **Metadata Overrides Physiological State:** Cabin location and destination can be stronger survival indicators than CryoSleep status in certain cases
- **Contextual Zero-Spending:** Zero spending must be interpreted differently based on CryoSleep status - it's expected behavior, not a negative indicator
- **Rule Interdependence:** Rules cannot be treated as independent classifiers; they require careful hierarchical ordering and exception handling

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **Reduce C-1 Confidence:** From 92% to 75% (CryoSleep is not absolute)
- **New Rules Confidence:** CS-2 (80%), ZS-1 (85%)
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Adjust to 82% (from 88%) due to increased complexity and exception handling
- **Spending Rules:** Reduce confidence by 5% across board (IS-1: 65%, IS-2: 65%, etc.) as they're less reliable for CryoSleep passengers

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Implement Rule Dependency Mapping:** Create a dependency graph to ensure rules execute in optimal order
- **Add Pre-processing Validation:** Flag all CryoSleep passengers with favorable cabin/destination combinations for special processing
- **Batch-level Context Analysis:** Analyze batch composition (percentage of CryoSleep passengers, age distribution) to dynamically adjust confidence levels
- **Error-weighted Rule Activation:** Rules that frequently cause errors should have reduced influence in subsequent batches

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **CryoSleep Subclassification:** Create CryoSleep subcategories based on cabin location, destination, and age ranges
- **Multi-dimensional Rule Conditions:** Combine multiple factors (CryoSleep + Cabin + Destination + Age) in rule conditions
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Automatically adjust scoring thresholds based on batch characteristics
- **Error-driven Rule Generation:** Use misclassifications to automatically propose new rule combinations

### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v3.8**

**Objective:** Address CryoSleep misclassifications by introducing exception handling, nuanced scoring, and improved rule hierarchy. Maintain accuracy while handling complex edge cases.

---

### **1. Comprehensive Hierarchical Decision Logic v3.8**

**STEP 1: PRIMARY STATE CLASSIFICATION**  
- PS-1: `Age < 0.5` → Predict `False` (98% confidence)  
- PS-2: `Age > 100` → Predict `False` (98% confidence)  

**STEP 2: AGE-BASED EXCEPTION**  
- AC-1: `Age < 5` AND `CryoSleep == False` → Score = +3, Predict `True` (90% confidence)

**STEP 3: CRYOSLEEP PROCESSING**  
- C-1: `CryoSleep == True` → Score = -3 (75% confidence)  
- CS-2 (NEW): `CryoSleep == True` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) AND `Age < 60` → Override C-1, Score = +2 (80% confidence)

**STEP 4: ZERO-SPEND CONTEXT**  
- ZS-1 (NEW): `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0` → Set all subsequent spending modifiers = 0 (85% confidence)

**STEP 5: AWAKE/CRYOSLEEP-SHARED RULES**  
- **Base Score:** +1 (applies only if no other rule triggers)

- SP-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND number of non-zero-spend categories == 1 AND value > 1000 → +2 (65% confidence)

- SH-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend > 1500` AND `zero-spend amenities <= 1` → +3 (75% confidence)

- IS-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend > 1000` AND `zero-spend amenities >= 4` → -1.5 per zero category (65% confidence)

- IS-2: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend BETWEEN 500-2000` AND `zero-spend amenities == 2` → -3 (65% confidence)

- LN-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND (`Spa+VRDeck+ShoppingMall`) > 3*(`RoomService+FoodCourt`) AND (`RoomService+FoodCourt`) < 200 → -2 (65% confidence)

**STEP 6: DEFAULT RULE**  
- DF-1: No other rule triggered → Apply base score (+1) if `TotalSpend > 0`, else score = 0 (60% confidence)

**PROCESSING ORDER:**  
PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy v3.8 with new CryoSleep exception handling
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-run current failed batch to validate improvements
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Flag all CryoSleep passengers with Cabin A/1/S or TRAPPIST-1e destination
   - Track scoring trajectory for CryoSleep exceptions
4. **Continuous Learning Cycle:**
   - Daily error analysis focused on CryoSleep cases
   - Automatic rule suggestion for recurring error patterns
5. **Confidence Escalation Protocol:** New rules require 3 successful batches before confidence can increase

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v3.8  
- **2h:** Re-process failed batch with new rules  
- **24h:** Review all CryoSleep predictions from last 48h  
- **72h:** Analyze error patterns for next refinement cycle  

This update creates a more nuanced handling of CryoSleep passengers while maintaining strong performance on other passenger categories.
