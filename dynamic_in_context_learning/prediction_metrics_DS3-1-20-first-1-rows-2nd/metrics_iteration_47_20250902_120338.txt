PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 47
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0070_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0070_01 reveals critical oversights in F-deck passenger evaluation and spending pattern interpretation:

- **F-Deck Over-optimism:** The system applies F-deck baseline score (-2) but overweights positive factors without sufficient validation
- **Spending Pattern Misclassification:** Moderate total spending (TotalSpend = 922.0) with extreme imbalance (FoodCourt=0.0) incorrectly triggers positive predictions
- **Destination Context Overweighting:** TRAPPIST-1e destination positive effects (+2 score) are being applied too broadly without cabin location validation
- **Zero-Category Under-penalization:** Extreme spending imbalance (FoodCourt=0.0 while other categories have spending) not adequately penalized
- **Age-Spending-Deck Interaction Gap:** Young adults (Age = 19.0) on F-deck with imbalanced spending exhibit different survival patterns than balanced spenders
- **VIP Status Ignorance:** Non-VIP status on F-deck with imbalanced spending not sufficiently considered

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement F-deck spending imbalance detection and enhance destination weighting validation:

- **Add F-Deck Spending Imbalance Rule:**
  - **F-SP-3 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'F/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Any spending category == 0` AND `TotalSpend > 500` → Score = -2 (80% confidence)

- **Enhance Destination Validation:**
  Modify TRAPPIST-DEST rules to require spending pattern validation:
  - **TRAPPIST-DEST-1a:** `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` AND `HomePlanet != 'Earth'` AND `Spending imbalance score < 3` → Score = +2 (85% confidence)

- **Refine Zero-Spend Evaluation:**
  Create imbalance detection system:
  - **IMB-1 (NEW):** `Max(spending categories) / Min(non-zero categories) > 10` → Score = -1 per imbalance level (75% confidence)

- **Add VIP Context Rules:**
  - **VIP-F-1 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'F/'` AND `VIP == False` AND `Spending imbalance > 5` → Score = -2 (78% confidence)

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **F-Deck Spending Imbalance:** Extreme spending imbalances on lower decks are strong negative indicators, regardless of total amount
- **Destination Conditional Effects:** TRAPPIST-1e positive effects are conditional on reasonable spending distribution
- **Age-Imbalance Correlation:** Young passengers with extreme spending imbalances show poorer survival rates
- **VIP-Deck Interaction:** Non-VIP status combined with deck location creates compound negative effects
- **Category Zero-Spend Significance:** Complete absence in any spending category (especially FoodCourt) is more significant than previously recognized

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New Rules:** F-SP-3: 80%, IMB-1: 75%, VIP-F-1: 78%
- **Destination Rules:** Add spending validation condition to TRAPPIST-DEST rules (-5% confidence without validation)
- **F-Deck Rules:** Reduce F-deck baseline confidence to 70% when spending imbalance detected
- **Spending Rules:** Increase penalty confidence for extreme imbalances by +15%
- **Validation Protocol:** New rules require immediate validation on F-deck imbalanced spending data

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Imbalance Detection Priority:** Ensure spending imbalance rules process before destination bonuses
- **VIP-Deck Matrix:** Create comprehensive VIP × deck × spending imbalance framework
- **Destination Validation:** Implement spending-based validation for all destination bonus rules
- **Batch-level Pattern Detection:** Add monitoring for batches containing F-deck passengers with spending imbalances
- **Error-Driven Refinement:** Flag all F-deck prediction errors for immediate rule development

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Enhanced Imbalance Framework:** Implement multi-dimensional spending imbalance evaluation
- **VIP-Deck Correlation:** Develop VIP-based deck penalty adjustment system
- **Destination Validation:** Create destination bonus qualification criteria based on spending patterns
- **Derived Features:** Create "Spending_Imbalance_Score" and "VIP_Deck_Modifier" composite features
- **Real-time Imbalance Detection:** Implement spending pattern validation during rule processing
