PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 32
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0053_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The model incorrectly predicted `False` for Passenger 0053_01, whose actual survival outcome was `True`. This misprediction stems from the following critical gaps in the v3.5 rule-based system:

- **Over-penalization of Imbalanced Spending:** The existing `IS-1` and `IS-2` rules focused heavily on penalizing passengers with multiple zero-spend categories. For 0053_01, who spent **only** in `ShoppingMall` (1938.0) with all other amenities at 0.0, the rules applied a severe penalty (-2.5 × 5 zero-spend categories = -12.5 modifier), overwhelming the base score (+1) and leading to a strongly negative total score (-11.5) and a `False` prediction.
  
- **Failure to Recognize Category-Specific Patterns:** The system did not account for scenarios where spending is highly concentrated in a **single non-essential category** (like ShoppingMall). This pattern may indicate focused purchasing behavior (e.g., buying survival gear or luxury items in bulk) rather than neglect, but the rules treated all zero-spend categories equally without considering the context of the non-zero spend.

- **Lack of a "Focused Spender" Rule:** No rule existed to identify passengers who spend significantly in one category while abstaining from others. The current `LN-1` (Luxury vs Necessity) rule did not trigger because the condition (`Spa + VRDeck > 3*(RoomService + FoodCourt)`) was not met—here, the high spend was in `ShoppingMall`, not `Spa` or `VRDeck`.

- **Inadequate Handling of Moderate Total Spend:** Although `TotalSpend` was high (1938.0), the model’s emphasis on penalizing zero-spend categories overrode the positive signal from the total expenditure.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

To prevent such errors, the rule set must be refined to better interpret concentrated spending patterns and reduce over-penalization:

- **Introduce a "Focused Spender" Rule (NEW - SP-1):**
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND exactly **one non-zero spending category** AND that category’s spend > 1000.
  - **Action:** Apply a **positive modifier of +2** (recognizing that focused spending may indicate strategic preparation rather than neglect).
  - **Rationale:** Catches passengers who make significant investments in a single area, which could be a survival-positive behavior.

- **Revise the "Severe Imbalanced Spending" Rule (IS-1):**
  - **Current Condition:** `number of zero-spend amenities >= 3`
  - **Revised Condition:** `number of zero-spend amenities >= 4` (to reduce over-penalization for cases with 3 zero-spend categories).
  - **Score Modifier:** Reduce to **-2.0 per zero-spend category** (down from -2.5) to lessen harsh penalties.

- **Refine the "Luxury vs Necessity" Rule (LN-1):**
  - **Current Condition:** Focused only on `Spa` and `VRDeck` vs. `RoomService` and `FoodCourt`.
  - **Revised Condition:** Expand to include `ShoppingMall` as a luxury category:  
    `(Spa + VRDeck + ShoppingMall) > 3 * (RoomService + FoodCourt)` AND `(RoomService + FoodCourt) < 200`.
  - **Rationale:** Accounts for high spending in `ShoppingMall` as a potential luxury/comfort indicator.

- **Adjust Rule Processing Order:** Ensure the new `SP-1` rule is processed **before** `IS-1` and `IS-2` to prioritize identifying focused spenders before applying imbalance penalties.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Focused Spending Can Be Predictive:** Passengers who concentrate their resources in one category may be exhibiting deliberate, survival-positive behavior (e.g., investing in durable goods from `ShoppingMall`). The pattern of spending (not just the amount or distribution) matters.
- **Not All Zero-Spend Categories Are Equal:** A zero spend in `RoomService` may be less concerning if the passenger is investing heavily in other preparedness categories (e.g., `ShoppingMall` for tools or supplies).
- **Behavioral Heterogeneity Exists:** Passengers may adopt diverse strategies for resource allocation during transport, which must be captured by nuanced rules rather than one-size-fits-all penalties.
- **Rule Interactions Can Cause Errors:** The order in which rules are applied significantly impacts outcomes. A highly penalizing rule triggered early can obscure more predictive patterns.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

Confidence levels should reflect the reliability and specificity of each rule, with adjustments for the new and modified rules:

- **High-Confidence Rules (85-95%):** State checks (PS-1, PS-2) and CryoSleep rule (C-1).
- **Medium-Confidence Rules (70-84%):** `SH-1` (75%), `IS-1` (75%, reduced from 80%), `LN-1` (70%, updated condition).
- **Low-Confidence Rules (60-69%):** New `SP-1` rule (65% initial confidence), `IS-2` (70%), `DF-1` (60%).
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Maintain at **85%** due to broader coverage, but with increased nuance.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Rule Execution Order:** Formalize the sequence to prioritize nuanced rules first:
  1. State Checks (PS-1/PS-2)
  2. New `SP-1` (Focused Spender)
  3. `SH-1` (Qualified High-Spender)
  4. `IS-1` (Severe Imbalanced)
  5. `IS-2` (Moderate Imbalanced)
  6. `LN-1` (Luxury vs Necessity)
  7. `DF-1` (Default)

- **Weighted Scoring System:** Implement a weighted aggregation for cases where multiple rules apply, rather than purely additive modifiers, to prevent over-penalization or over-rewarding.

- **Post-Batch Validation:** Continue scanning for `None` predictions and extreme scores (e.g., total score < -10 or > +10) that may indicate rule conflicts or errors.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Edge Case Clustering:** Automatically group passengers with similar spending patterns (e.g., high spend in one category, zeros elsewhere) for manual review and rule creation.
- **Dynamic Rule Expansion:** Use misclassification errors to trigger the creation of new rules (e.g., `SP-1` was derived from this error).
- **Confidence-Based Learning:** Gradually increase confidence scores for new rules as they demonstrate reliability across batches.

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Deployment:** Add the `SP-1` rule and update `IS-1` and `LN-1` conditions and modifiers. Enforce the new processing order.
2. **Batch Re-run:** Re-process the failed batch (including 0053_01) to validate the corrections.
3. **Monitoring:** Flag passengers triggering `SP-1` for validation to quickly refine the rule’s parameters.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Implement a weekly review of misclassified cases to identify new patterns for rule creation.

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Immediate:** Deploy v3.6.
- **1h:** Re-run the failed batch.
- **4h:** Update monitoring to track `SP-1` usage.
- **Ongoing:** Weekly error analysis for iterative rule improvements.

This update ensures the system better captures nuanced spending behaviors, reducing over-penalization and improving accuracy for edge cases.
