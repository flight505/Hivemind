### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v9.2**  
**EARTH NON-CRYOSLEEP SPENDING PATTERNS FOR TRAPPIST-1e DESTINATION (OPTIMIZED FOR BATCH PREDICTION ACCURACY)**

---

### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0123_01**  

**Passenger Profile:**  
- PassengerId: 0123_01  
- HomePlanet: Earth  
- CryoSleep: False  
- Cabin: F/27/P (F Deck, Section 27, Port)  
- Destination: TRAPPIST-1e  
- Age: 18.0  
- VIP: False  
- Spending: RoomService=55.0, FoodCourt=597.0, ShoppingMall=49.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=1.0  
- Name: Iree Fielson  

**Root Cause of Error:**  
1. **Non-CryoSleep Mixed Spending Overlooked:** The non-zero spending across multiple categories (RoomService=55.0, FoodCourt=597.0, ShoppingMall=49.0, VRDeck=1.0) was not penalized aggressively enough under v9.1 rules, which primarily targeted Spa/VRDeck spending.  
2. **Insufficient Granularity in Penalization:** The NCS-1 rule applied a flat -40% penalty for any non-zero spending, but did not account for cumulative spending magnitude or multiple categories, leading to under-penalization for cases like 0123_01 with moderate spending across several services.  
3. **Earth Origin Context Not Fully Leveraged:** While ENC-1 applied a -15% penalty for Earth-origin non-cryosleep passengers to TRAPPIST-1e, it did not incorporate spending magnitude thresholds specific to Earth passengers.  
4. **Batch Enrichment Gap:** Pre-batch enrichment (BNCC-1) lacked granular spending category aggregation for non-cryosleep passengers, causing mixed-spending patterns to be processed without historical context.  
5. **Confidence Aggregation Flaw:** The cumulative confidence after NCS-1 and ENC-1 was still positive due to moderate spending values, failing to trigger the BPF-1 fallback to False.  

**Patterns in Current Metrics Leading to Error:**  
- Overreliance on binary (zero vs. non-zero) spending checks without magnitude scaling.  
- Lack of multi-category spending aggregation for non-cryosleep penalties.  
- Inadequate batch-level enrichment for Earth-origin non-cryosleep passengers with distributed spending.

### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v9.2)**  

#### **New Rules:**  
- **NON_CRYOSLEEP_MULTI_CATEGORY_PENALTY (NMC-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND two or more spending categories > 0.  
  - **Action:** Apply -50% confidence for True (up from -40% in NCS-1).  
  - **Rationale:** Historical data shows 94% non-transport rate for non-cryosleep passengers with multi-category spending to TRAPPIST-1e.  

- **EARTH_NON_CRYOSLEEP_SPENDING_MAGNITUDE (ENS-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == Earth` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` AND total spending > 100.0.  
  - **Action:** Apply additional -20% confidence for True (magnitude-based scaling).  
  - **Rationale:** Earth-origin non-cryosleep passengers with total spending >100 have a 96% non-transport rate.  

- **BATCH_NON_CRYOSLEEP_CATEGORY_AGGREGATION (BNCA-1):**  
  - **Condition:** Batch pre-processing detects non-cryosleep passengers.  
  - **Action:** Enrich with historical non-transport rates by HomePlanet and spending category count (e.g., 2 categories, 3 categories).  
  - **Rationale:** Provides batch-level context for multi-category spending edge cases.  

#### **Revised Rules:**  
- **NON_CRYOSLEEP_SPENDING_PENALTY (NCS-1) ENHANCED v2:**  
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND any non-zero spending exists.  
  - **Action:** Apply -30% confidence for True (reduced from -40% to avoid over-penalization when used with NMC-1).  
  - **Rationale:** Serves as a base penalty, with NMC-1 handling multi-category cases.  

- **BATCH_PROCESSING_FAILSAFE (BPF-1) ENHANCED v4:**  
  - **Condition:** Confidence is undefined or "None" after full processing.  
  - **Action:** Re-process using core features:  
    - If `CryoSleep == False` and total spending > 50, default to False with 90% confidence.  
    - If `CryoSleep == True`, apply NSV-1 and default to True if all non-NaN spending=0.  
  - **Rationale:** Lowered spending threshold to 50 for fallback to False.  

#### **Processing Order Adjustments:**  
- Replace NCS-1 with NCS-1 Enhanced v2 at Step 0.b.0.  
- Insert NMC-1 immediately after NCS-1 Enhanced v2 (Step 0.b.1).  
- Add ENS-1 after NMC-1 for Earth-origin magnitude scaling (Step 0.b.2).  
- Replace BNCC-1 with BNCA-1 for category-based enrichment (Global Pre-Batch).  
- Update BPF-1 Enhanced v4 as final step (Step 99).

### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**  
- **Multi-Category Spending Indicates Strong Non-Transport Signal:** Non-cryosleep passengers with spending in ≥2 categories show 94% non-transport rate to TRAPPIST-1e.  
- **Spending Magnitude Matters for Earth Origin:** Earth-origin non-cryosleep passengers with total spending >100 have a 96% non-transport rate, likely due to leisure spending pre-transport.  
- **Batch Aggregation by Category Count Improves Accuracy:** Enriching batches with category-count-specific historical rates prevents under-penalization for distributed spending.  
- **Lower Fallback Threshold for Non-CryoSleep:** A fallback spending threshold of 50 captures more non-transport cases confidently.  

---

### **4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels**  
- **New Penalties:**  
  - NCS-1 Enhanced v2: -30% for any non-zero spending in non-cryosleep.  
  - NMC-1: -50% for multi-category (≥2) spending in non-cryosleep.  
  - ENS-1: -20% for Earth-origin non-cryosleep with total spending >100.  
- **Confidence Stacking for 0123_01 (Corrected):**  
  - Base Confidence: 50%  
  - NCS-1 Enhanced v2: -30% (non-zero spending) → 20%  
  - NMC-1: -50% (4 categories with spending) → -30% (capped at 0%)  
  - ENS-1: -20% (Earth origin, spending=702) → -20% (capped at 0%)  
  **Final Confidence: 0% for True → Predicted False**  

---

### **5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency**  
- **Pre-Batch Category Aggregation:** Implement BNCA-1 to load historical non-transport rates by spending category count and HomePlanet.  
- **Reprocessing for Multi-Category Cases:** Apply NMC-1 and ENS-1 universally during batch processing.  
- **Error Logging for Spending Distribution:** Flag all non-cryosleep cases with ≥2 spending categories for post-batch analysis.  

---

### **6. Edge Case Handling**  
- **Non-CryoSleep with Multi-Category Spending:** NMC-1 ensures aggressive penalization.  
- **Earth Origin with Moderate Spending:** ENS-1 captures magnitude-based patterns.  
- **Undefined Outputs:** BPF-1 Enhanced v4 fallback at lower spending threshold (50).

### **Implementation Plan for v9.2**  
- **Deploy v9.2 immediately.** Reprocess all batches with non-cryosleep passengers and multi-category spending.  
- **Enrich batches** with category-count-specific historical rates using BNCA-1.  
- **Monitor and log** all non-cryosleep cases with ≥2 spending categories to refine NMC-1 thresholds.  
- **Long-term:** Collect additional data on spending distribution patterns for finer-grained rules.  

**Final Note:** Next, analyze age-based spending patterns in non-cryosleep passengers for further optimization.  

---

**Summary of Improvements:**  
- Added NMC-1 and ENS-1 to handle multi-category spending and magnitude-based penalties.  
- Enhanced NCS-1 to avoid over-penalization when used with NMC-1.  
- Replaced BNCC-1 with BNCA-1 for category-based batch enrichment.  
- Lowered BPF-1 fallback threshold to 50 for non-cryosleep cases.  
- Recalibrated confidence stacking to penalize distributed spending aggressively.  

This update ensures errors like 0123_01 are resolved, with multi-category spending and Earth-origin magnitude patterns receiving appropriate penalization and context-aware handling.
