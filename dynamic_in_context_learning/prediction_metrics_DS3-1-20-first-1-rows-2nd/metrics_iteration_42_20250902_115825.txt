PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 42
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0067_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0067_01 reveals critical deficiencies in handling cryosleep infants on G-deck:

- **Age-CryoSleep-Deck Interaction Gap:** The system failed to recognize that infants (Age = 0.0) in cryosleep on G-deck require special handling
- **CryoSleep Priority Mismatch:** Cryosleep processing (C-1: -3 score) incorrectly overrides infant exception logic (AC-1: +3 score)
- **G-Deck Penalty Misapplication:** DECK-G-1 rule (-3 score) was incorrectly applied despite cryosleep state and infant status
- **Zero-Spend Context Oversight:** ZS-1 cryosleep zero-spend logic didn't properly account for infant passengers
- **Rule Processing Order Issue:** Cryosleep rules processed before age exceptions, preventing proper override

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement infant-specific cryosleep handling and refine processing order:

- **Add Infant CryoSleep Exception:**
  - **CS-INF-1 (NEW):** `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 0.5` → Override all cryosleep penalties, Score = +3 (92% confidence)
  
- **Modify Processing Order:**
  Move age-based exceptions before cryosleep processing:
  PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → **CS-INF-1** → C-1 → CS-2 → CS-F-1 → CS-E-1 → CS-E-2 → ...

- **Enhance ZS-1 for Infants:**
  Add infant-specific clause: If `Age < 0.5` AND `CryoSleep == True` → Score = +3 (90% confidence)

- **Add G-Deck CryoSleep Infant Rule:**
  **G-CS-INF-1 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'G/'` AND `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 0.5` → Score = +2 (88% confidence)

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Infant Survival Priority:** Infants in cryosleep show exceptionally high survival rates regardless of deck location
- **CryoSleep-Age Interaction:** Cryosleep effects are fundamentally different for infants versus adults
- **G-Deck Infant Exception:** Despite general G-deck penalties, infants exhibit survival patterns similar to higher decks
- **Emergency Protocol Bias:** Transport systems may prioritize infant survival even in disadvantaged locations
- **Zero-Spend Context:** Infant zero-spend patterns in cryosleep indicate different survival mechanisms

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New Infant Rules:** CS-INF-1: 92%, G-CS-INF-1: 88% (based on infant survival patterns)
- **CryoSleep Rules:** Reduce C-1 confidence to 70% when infants are present
- **Age Exceptions:** Increase AC-1 confidence to 92% for better override capability
- **ZS-1 Enhancement:** Add +5% confidence for infant-specific clauses
- **Validation Protocol:** New infant rules require immediate validation on historical infant data

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Age-Based Processing Priority:** Ensure age exceptions process before deck and cryosleep rules
- **Infant-Specific Rule Matrix:** Create comprehensive infant × cryosleep × deck survival probability matrix
- **Confidence Cascading:** Implement confidence adjustment system for rule overrides
- **Batch-level Infant Detection:** Add special monitoring for batches containing infant passengers
- **Error-Driven Infant Learning:** Flag all infant prediction errors for immediate rule development

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Comprehensive Infant Framework:** Implement full infant × cryosleep × deck × spend survival logic
- **Age-Phase Processing:** Create separate processing phases for different age groups (infant, child, adult, elderly)
- **Confidence Inheritance:** Develop confidence inheritance system for override rules
- **Derived Features:** Create "Is_Infant" and "Infant_CryoSleep" composite features
- **Real-time Age Validation:** Implement age validation checks during rule processing

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy v4.5 with infant cryosleep specialization and processing order refinement
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-process current failed batch to validate new infant rules
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Track all infant predictions across all decks
   - Monitor cryosleep-override success rates
   - Validate age-based processing order effectiveness
4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Develop comprehensive infant survival matrix
   - Create age-phase specific processing pipelines
5. **Confidence Validation:** New infant rules require immediate validation on historical infant data
6. **Feature Engineering:** Implement derived features: Is_Infant, Infant_CryoSleep_Deck

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v4.5 with infant cryosleep rules and processing order  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch 0067_01  
- **4h:** Analyze all recent infant predictions across all batches  
- **24h:** Review cryosleep-override patterns for all age groups  
- **72h:** Evaluate need for additional age-phase specific rules  

This update addresses infant cryosleep handling gaps, refines age-based processing priority, and ensures proper rule override functionality for improved batch prediction accuracy.
