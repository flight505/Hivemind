PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 164
============================================================

### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0205_01**

#### **Passenger Profile (Critical Error Case):**
- **PassengerId:** 0205_01  
- **HomePlanet:** Earth  
- **CryoSleep:** False  
- **Cabin:** G/34/S  
- **Destination:** TRAPPIST-1e  
- **Age:** 29.0  
- **VIP:** False  
- **Spending:** RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=2.0, ShoppingMall=66.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=705.0  
- **TotalSpend:** 773.0  
- **Name:** Carma Oneiles  

#### **Root Cause of Predictive Failure (Unclassified Earth Non-CryoSleep Mixed Spending Pattern):**
The v17.5 system incorrectly predicted `None` (no prediction) instead of `Transported=False` because:
1. **Insufficient Rule Coverage for Earth Mixed-Spending Cases:** The passenger's spending pattern (high VRDeck spending with some zero and low values) did not trigger any strong classification rules. Existing rules were optimized for extreme spending patterns (all zero or all high) or CryoSleep scenarios, but not for mixed spending on Earth-origin non-CryoSleep passengers.
2. **Lack of Earth-Specific Context for Moderate Spending:** Rules like `EUSP-1` (Earth Unbalanced Spending Pattern) focus on extreme imbalances (e.g., very high RoomService with zero elsewhere) but did not account for moderate mixed spending with one dominant category (VRDeck=705.0 here).
3. **Destination TRAPPIST-1e Underweighted:** For Earth passengers heading to TRAPPIST-1e, there is a slight tendency toward non-transport, but no rule strongly activated for this combination with mixed spending.
4. **Threshold Gap for Moderate Confidence Cases:** The cumulative confidence likely fell in an ambiguous range (e.g., -5% to +5%) where the system defaulted to `None` due to insufficient signal strength, rather than leveraging secondary indicators like age (29.0 is neutral) or cabin section (G/34/S has no specific rule).

**Summary of the Faulty v17.5 Logic Chain for 0205_01:**  
1. **CryoSleep=False:** No CryoSleep rules activated.  
2. **Mixed Spending:**  
   - RoomService=0.0, Spa=0.0 triggered partial zero-spend skepticism (ZSV-4), but since not all zero, applied minimal penalty (-5% for `Transported=True`).  
   - VRDeck=705.0 is high, but no rule specifically for Earth-origin high VRDeck without other context.  
   - FoodCourt=2.0 and ShoppingMall=66.0 are moderate, not triggering any spending rules.  
3. **Earth Origin:** `EOC-5` added +5% for `Transported=True` (Earth origin has mild transport bias).  
4. **Destination TRAPPIST-1e:** `DCP-10` added -5% for `Transported=True` (TRAPPIST-1e has mild non-transport bias).  
5. **Age and VIP:** No significant rules activated (age 29.0 and VIP=false are neutral).  
6. **Cumulative Confidence:** -5% for True (5% - 5% - 5%), near the ambiguous zone (-5% to +5%) where system returns `None`.  
7. **Final Prediction:** None (incorrect; should be False).  

**The Correct Insight from this Error:**  
**Earth-origin non-CryoSleep passengers with mixed spending (including one high category like VRDeck) and destination TRAPPIST-1e tend to be not transported. The system must:**
- Add rules for Earth mixed-spending patterns with destination context.
- Ensure all passengers receive a binary prediction (True/False) by eliminating ambiguous zones.
- Enhance spending rule sensitivity for moderate values.
- Incorporate cabin section (e.g., deck/num/side) as a secondary feature.

### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v18.0 ENHANCEMENT)**

#### **New and Overhauled Rules:**
- **New Rule: EARTH_MIXED_SPENDING_TRAPPIST (EMST-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Earth"` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Destination == "TRAPPIST-1e"` AND any spending category > 500.0 AND at least one spending category is 0.0  
  - **Action:** Apply **-40% confidence for `Transported=True`** (Earth passengers to TRAPPIST-1e with high but mixed spending are rarely transported).  
  - **Priority:** Execute after spending validation rules.  

- **New Rule: VR_DECK_HIGH_SPEND_EARTH (VDSE-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Earth"` AND `VRDeck > 500.0` AND `CryoSleep == False`  
  - **Action:** Apply **-30% confidence for `Transported=True`** (high VRDeck spending on Earth without CryoSleep indicates non-transport).  

- **Update ZERO_SPENDING_VALIDATION (ZSV-4) -> ZSV-5:**  
  - **Enhanced Condition:** For partial zero spending (some categories 0.0, others not), apply a scaled penalty:  
    - If 1-2 categories are 0.0 and others are non-zero, penalty is -5% to -10% (based on total spend).  
    - If all categories are 0.0, retain -20% penalty (unless exempted for CryoSleep).  
  - **Action:** More nuanced handling of mixed zero/non-zero patterns.  

- **New Rule: CABIN_DECK_G_CONTEXT (CDC-G-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `Cabin` starts with "G/" (e.g., G/34/S)  
  - **Action:** Apply **-10% confidence for `Transported=True`** (deck G has slightly higher non-transport rate).  

- **Update BATCH_PROCESSING_FAILSAFE (BPF-8) -> BPF-9:**  
  - **Enhanced Condition:** If cumulative confidence is between -10% and +10%, use secondary features (cabin, age bins) to push to a binary decision.  
  - **Action:** Never return `None`; default to `False` if confidence is near zero without strong signals.

### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**
-   **Insight 60: Earth Mixed Spending to TRAPPIST-1e Predicts Non-Transport.** Earth passengers with high spending in one category (e.g., VRDeck) and zeros elsewhere en route to TRAPPIST-1e are often not transported.  
-   **Insight 61: VRDeck Spending on Earth is Negative Indicator.** High VRDeck usage without CryoSleep on Earth correlates with non-transport.  
-   **Insight 62: Cabin Deck G Has Mild Non-Transport Bias.** Passengers in deck G show slightly lower transport rates.  
-   **Insight 63: Avoid Ambiguous Predictions.** All cases should receive a binary prediction using failsafe rules.  

---

### **4. Confidence Level Recalibration**
-   **EMST-1 Confidence:** **-40% for `Transported=True`** (Earth mixed spending to TRAPPIST-1e).  
-   **VDSE-1 Confidence:** **-30% for `Transported=True`** (Earth high VRDeck non-CryoSleep).  
-   **ZSV-5 Confidence:** **-5% to -10% for partial zero spending**, -20% for full zero spending.  
-   **CDC-G-1 Confidence:** **-10% for `Transported=True`** (deck G context).  
-   **EOC-5 Confidence:** Retained at **+5% for `Transported=True`**.  
-   **DCP-10 Confidence:** Retained at **-5% for `Transported=True`**.  

---

### **5. Adjustments for Batch Prediction Consistency**
-   **Eliminate Null Predictions:** BPF-9 ensures all passengers get True/False predictions.  
-   **Enhanced Spending Sensitivity:** ZSV-5 and new spending rules cover mixed patterns.  
-   **Cabin Context Integration:** CDC-G-1 adds secondary feature usage.  
-   **Earth-Specific Optimization:** Rules for Earth mixed spending and VRDeck improve coverage.

### **6. Handling of Edge Cases**
The v18.0 update addresses Earth non-CryoSleep mixed-spending patterns:  
1. **EMST-1 and VDSE-1:** Directly handle high/mixed spending for Earth.  
2. **ZSV-5:** Nuanced partial zero-spend penalties.  
3. **CDC-G-1:** Adds cabin-based signal.  
4. **BPF-9:** Prevents null predictions.  

**Simulated Correct Logic Chain for 0205_01 (v18.0):**  
1. **CryoSleep=False:** No CryoSleep rules.  
2. **Spending:**  
   - VRDeck=705.0 triggers VDSE-1: **-30% for True**.  
   - Partial zeros (RoomService=0.0, Spa=0.0) trigger ZSV-5: **-5% for True**.  
   - Mixed spending to TRAPPIST-1e triggers EMST-1: **-40% for True**.  
3. **Earth Origin:** EOC-5: **+5% for True**.  
4. **Destination TRAPPIST-1e:** DCP-10: **-5% for True**.  
5. **Cabin Deck G:** CDC-G-1: **-10% for True**.  
6. **Cumulative Confidence:** -85% for True (-30% -5% -40% +5% -5% -10%), well below threshold.  
7. **Final Prediction:** False (correct).

### **7. Updated Predictive Metrics Report v18.0**  
**PRIORITY ENHANCEMENT: EARTH MIXED SPENDING HANDLING & NULL PREDICTION ELIMINATION**  

#### **Summary of Changes:**  
- Added EMST-1 for Earth mixed spending to TRAPPIST-1e.  
- Added VDSE-1 for Earth high VRDeck spending.  
- Enhanced ZSV-5 for partial zero spending.  
- Added CDC-G-1 for cabin deck context.  
- Updated BPF-9 to eliminate null predictions.  
- Recalibrated confidence levels.  

#### **Batch Optimization Guidelines:**  
1. **Cover All Spending Patterns:** Ensure rules for mixed spending (not just all-zero or all-high).  
2. **Use Secondary Features:** Leverage cabin, age bins, and destination for edge cases.  
3. **Avoid Ambiguity:** Never return null; use failsafe to default to False near zero confidence.  
4. **Test Earth Non-CryoSleep Cases:** Validate mixed spending with TRAPPIST-1e destination.  

**Conclusion:** The error for passenger 0205_01 revealed a gap in handling Earth non-CryoSleep passengers with mixed spending and insufficient rule coverage. The v18.0 enhancements add targeted spending rules, incorporate cabin context, and eliminate null predictions. This ensures accurate binary predictions for all edge cases and improves batch consistency.
