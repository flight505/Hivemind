PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 30
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0051_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The model failed to generate a prediction (`None`) for Passenger 0051_01, which resulted in a mismatch with the actual outcome (`False`). This error stems from several critical gaps in the current rule-based system:

-   **Incomplete Rule Coverage:** The existing rules (v3.3/v3.4 framework focused on CryoSleep) did not account for this specific awake passenger profile: someone with a mix of **zero-spend categories** (`RoomService`, `ShoppingMall` = 0.0) and **high-spend categories** (`Spa` = 1379.0, `VRDeck` = 127.0), resulting in a moderate `TotalSpend` (~1618.0). The rules likely lacked a specific condition to handle this "moderate but highly imbalanced" spending pattern.
-   **Rule Trigger Thresholds:** The "Imbalanced Spending Rule (IS-1)" may not have been triggered because `TotalSpend` (1618) is greater than 1000, but the number of zero-spend categories (2) might not have met a specific threshold for penalty application, or the rule's logic was not designed for this combination.
-   **Absence of a Default or Fallback Rule:** The system appears to lack a catch-all or default rule for cases that do not meet any specific rule's conditions. This led to a `None` prediction instead of a default probability estimate.
-   **Data Interpretation Gap:** The model failed to recognize that significant spending in luxury amenities (`Spa`, `VRDeck`) coupled with zero spending in essentials (`RoomService`) could be a stronger signal of resource mismanagement or distress than previously calibrated.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

The rule set must be expanded to ensure comprehensive coverage and include a robust default mechanism.

-   **Introduce a "Moderate Imbalanced Spending" Rule (NEW - IS-2):**
    -   **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND `TotalSpend` BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 AND number of zero-spend amenities â‰¥ 2.
    -   **Action:** Apply a negative score modifier proportional to the imbalance. For example: `-1.5 * (number of zero-spend categories)`.
    -   **Rationale:** Catches passengers who are spending but in a lopsided manner, which may indicate poor planning or underlying issues.

-   **Implement a Mandatory Default Prediction Rule (NEW - DF-1):**
    -   **Condition:** No other rule has been applied after processing all primary rules.
    -   **Action:** Assign a default score based on overall population survival rate (e.g., base score of +1) and make a prediction. This prevents `None` outputs.
    -   **Confidence:** Set to a lower level (e.g., 60%) to reflect the uncertainty.

-   **Refine the "Qualified High-Spender" Rule (SH-1):**
    -   **Current Condition:** `number of zero-spend amenities == 0`
    -   **Revised Condition:** `number of zero-spend amenities <= 1` AND `TotalSpend > 1500`
    -   **Rationale:** Allows for minor data inconsistencies or single-category abstention while still rewarding high overall spending.

-   **Add a "Luxury vs Necessity" Rule (NEW - LN-1):**
    -   **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND spending on `Spa` + `VRDeck` > 3 * (`RoomService` + `FoodCourt`)
    -   **Action:** Apply a negative modifier (e.g., -2).
    -   **Rationale:** Identifies passengers prioritizing luxury over basic sustenance, a potential risk factor.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

-   **Spending Distribution is as Important as Total Amount:** A moderate total spend can mask severe imbalances that are predictive of survival. The pattern of spending (which categories are used) provides crucial context.
-   **The System Must Be Exhaustive:** A predictive model for batch processing cannot have gaps. Every possible input must map to an output, necessitating a fallback mechanism.
-   **Behavioral Economics Applies:** Passenger spending behavior may reflect real-world psychological patterns (e.g., focusing on comfort in stressful situations), which can be codified into rules.
-   **"None" is an Invalid Output:** In a production batch system, a failure to predict is worse than a low-confidence prediction. The system must always produce an outcome.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

Confidence should be tied to the specificity and reliability of the rule applied.

-   **High-Confidence Rules (85-95%):** Rules based on clear, binary states (CryoSleep, VIP status).
-   **Medium-Confidence Rules (70-84%):** Rules based on spending patterns and thresholds (IS-1, SH-1, ES-1).
-   **Low-Confidence Rules (60-69%):** New, more nuanced rules (IS-2, LN-1) and the default rule (DF-1). These can be increased as they are validated with more data.
-   **Overall Model Confidence:** Adjust to **85%** due to broader coverage and the elimination of `None` predictions, though with more nuanced lower-confidence rules in the mix.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

-   **Rule Execution Order:** Formalize the sequence as a decision tree: State Check -> High-Confidence Patterns -> Medium-Confidence Patterns -> Default Rule.
-   **Batch Validation Check:** Implement a post-prediction step in the batch process that scans for and eliminates any `None` values, forcing them through the default rule.
-   **Cross-Rule Validation:** For passengers where multiple rules apply, implement a weighted scoring system rather than simple additive modifiers to prevent score explosion/implosion.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

-   **Create a "Rule Coverage" Dashboard:** Monitor the percentage of predictions made by each rule. A high use of the default rule indicates a gap in coverage for that batch.
-   **Edge Case Clustering:** Automatically cluster passengers that trigger the default rule or have very low confidence scores. These clusters can be analyzed to generate new, specific rules.
-   **Continuous Rule Expansion:** Establish a process for creating new rules based on analysis of prediction errors and misclassified cases, moving beyond initial assumptions.

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Deployment:** Add the new rules (**IS-2, LN-1, DF-1**) to the "Awake" rule set and define their order of precedence.
2.  **Batch Processing Safeguard:** Implement a validation step at the end of the batch process that queries the prediction database for any `NULL` or `None` values and re-processes those records through the **DF-1 Default Rule**.
3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Create an alert for any batch job where more than 1% of predictions are generated by the default rule (DF-1). This indicates a previously unseen passenger pattern that requires analysis for a new rule.
4.  **Validation Focus:** Priority for manual validation should now shift to passengers who trigger the new mid-confidence rules (IS-2, LN-1) and the default rule (DF-1) to quickly refine their parameters.

**Implementation Timeline:**
-   **Immediate:** Deploy new rules (IS-2, LN-1, DF-1) and processing order.
-   **1h:** Implement the post-batch `NULL` value check and correction script.
-   **4h:** Update monitoring dashboards to track rule usage percentages.
-   **8h:** Re-run the entire failed batch (including 0051_01) through the updated system (v3.5) to verify 100% prediction coverage and accuracy.

This update ensures the system is robust and exhaustive, eliminating prediction gaps while providing a structured framework for continuous learning from new edge cases.
