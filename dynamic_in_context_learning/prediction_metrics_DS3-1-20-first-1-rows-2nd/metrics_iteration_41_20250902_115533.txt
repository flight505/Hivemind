PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 41
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0066_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0066_01 reveals critical gaps in G-deck evaluation and spending pattern context integration:

- **G-Deck Evaluation Deficiency:** The current DECK-G-1 rule provides a base score of -3 but lacks nuanced handling for specific spending patterns and age combinations on G-deck
- **VRDeck Spending Oversimplification:** VD-1 rule (-2 score) triggers for VRDeck > 1000 AND RoomService < 100, but doesn't account for deck location or age context
- **Age-Deck Interaction Missing:** The system lacks rules that combine advanced age (62 years) with G-deck location and specific spending patterns
- **Spending Rule Threshold Issues:** The current spending evaluation rules have minimum age thresholds (Age >= 5) that exclude older passengers from proper evaluation
- **Default Rule Inadequacy:** DF-1 default logic doesn't sufficiently account for G-deck passengers with mixed spending patterns

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement G-deck spending specialization and enhance age context integration:

- **Add G-Deck Spending Rules:**
  - **G-SP-1 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'G/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age > 60` AND `VRDeck > 400` AND `RoomService < 200` → Score = -3 (78% confidence)
  - **G-SP-2 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'G/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age > 60` AND `TotalSpend > 500` AND `ShoppingMall > Spa` → Score = -2 (75% confidence)

- **Enhance VRDeck Rule (VD-1):**
  Add deck and age context:
  - `VRDeck > 400` AND `RoomService < 200` AND `Cabin starts with 'G/'` AND `Age > 60` → Score = -3 (80% confidence)
  - `VRDeck > 800` AND `RoomService < 100` AND `Age > 50` → Score = -2 (75% confidence) [existing logic]

- **Modify Age Thresholds in Spending Rules:**
  Remove upper age limits from spending evaluation rules to include older passengers

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **G-Deck Age Spending Patterns:** Older passengers on G-deck with high VRDeck spending but low RoomService show significantly lower survival rates
- **Deck-Specific Age Effects:** Spending pattern significance varies by deck location for older passengers
- **VRDeck-RoomService Inverse Relationship:** High VRDeck combined with low RoomService correlates strongly with non-survival, especially on lower decks
- **Age-Based Rule Exclusion:** Current age thresholds in spending rules accidentally exclude important passenger segments from proper evaluation
- **Deck-Spending Interaction:** The same spending pattern has different survival implications depending on deck location

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New G-Deck Rules:** G-SP-1: 78%, G-SP-2: 75% (initial validation required)
- **Enhanced VD-1:** 80% for G-deck context with age, 75% for general case
- **Spending Rules:** Increase confidence by 5% for rules that now include older passengers
- **Validation Protocol:** New G-deck rules require 2 successful batches before confidence increases
- **Age Context:** Add ±3% confidence adjustment for passengers over 60 based on spending pattern consistency

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Complete Age Integration:** Remove upper age limits from all spending evaluation rules
- **Deck-Spending Matrix:** Create survival probability matrix for all deck × spending pattern × age combinations
- **Age-Based Rule Calibration:** Develop age-specific thresholds for spending pattern rules
- **Batch-level Age Distribution:** Monitor age distribution patterns in each batch for anomaly detection
- **Cross-Rule Validation:** Implement consistency checks between deck rules and spending rules for older passengers

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Comprehensive Age-Deck-Spending Matrix:** Implement full age × deck × spending pattern survival probability lookup
- **Age-Adaptive Thresholds:** Create dynamic spending thresholds that adjust based on passenger age
- **Confidence Adaptation:** Implement confidence adjustments based on age-spending pattern consistency
- **Derived Features:** Create "Age_Deck_Group" and "Spending_Age_Ratio" composite features
- **Error-Driven Learning:** Automatically flag age-deck-spending combinations that produce errors for specialized rule development

**STEP 10: ENHANCED DEFAULT RULE**  
- DF-1: No other rule triggered → 
  - If `HomePlanet == 'Earth'` → Score = Score - 1
  - If `HomePlanet is NaN` → Score = Score + 0.5 (65% confidence)
  - If `TotalSpend > 2000` AND (`Cabin starts with 'A/'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) → Score = Score + 2
