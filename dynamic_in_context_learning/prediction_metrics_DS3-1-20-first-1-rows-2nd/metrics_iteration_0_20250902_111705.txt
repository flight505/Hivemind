PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 0
============================================================

Of course. Here is a comprehensive predictive metrics report based on my analysis of the initial Spaceship Titanic dataset. This report is designed to guide the logic for a batch prediction system processing one passenger at a time.

### **Predictive Metrics Report: Spaceship Titanic Transport Prediction**

**Report Objective:** To provide a foundational rule-based predictive framework for determining the likelihood of passenger transportation to another dimension. This system is built on initial data patterns and is intended for iterative refinement as more data becomes available.

**Analysis Basis:** Initial training sample of 20 passengers. Note: The small sample size means these metrics represent strong initial indicators rather than definitive conclusions. Confidence is higher for rules with more supporting evidence.

---

### **1. Key Identified Patterns & Correlations**

From the initial data, several strong correlations with the `Transported` target variable have emerged:

*   **CryoSleep is a Primary Indicator:** A very strong pattern is observed.
    *   **5 out of 5** passengers in CryoSleep (`CryoSleep = True`) were `Transported`.
    *   This is the single most reliable predictor in the initial dataset.
*   **Spending Behavior is Highly Predictive:**
    *   Passengers who spent **nothing** (`0.0`) across all five amenities (`RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck`) have a very high transport rate. This group often overlaps with those in CryoSleep.
    *   Conversely, passengers with **high total spending** (e.g., > 1000 cumulative credits) show a tendency to **not be transported**. See Passenger 0003_01 (Europa, VIP, high spender, not transported).
*   **Planet of Origin Suggests Propensity:**
    *   **Europa** passengers show a mixed but slightly lower transport rate in this sample.
    *   **Earth** and **Mars** passengers show a higher rate of transport, but the sample is too small to be definitive. This feature will be powerful when combined with others.
*   **Age May Indicate Vulnerability:**
    *   The transported group includes several younger individuals (ages 0, 14, 16, 24, 28). The non-transported group trends older (39, 44, 45, 48, 58). The very young (e.g., Age 0, Passenger 0017_01) were transported.
*   **Cabin Location (Preliminary):**
    *   Cabin deck `F` and `G` have numerous transported passengers.
    *   Cabin side `S` (Starboard) appears frequently in the transported list. Side `P` (Port) appears more in the non-transported list, but the sample is small. This feature requires extraction (Deck/Side/Number) for full utility.
*   **VIP Status:** Not a strong standalone predictor in this sample. Both VIP and non-VIP passengers appear in both outcome groups.
*   **Group Travel:** Passengers sharing a `PassengerId` prefix (e.g., 0003_01 & 0003_02, 0008_01 & 0008_02 & 0008_03) did **not** consistently share the same fate. Group membership should not override individual passenger characteristics.

### **2. Detailed Decision Rules & Logic Flow**

For batch processing, each passenger should be evaluated against the following rule hierarchy. Rules are listed in descending order of confidence based on the initial data.

**Rule 1: The CryoSleep Rule**
*   **Condition:** `CryoSleep == True`
*   **Prediction:** `Transported = True`
*   **Confidence:** **Very High** (100% in sample).
*   **Action:** If true, assign highest probability and proceed to next passenger.

**Rule 2: The Zero-Spend Rule**
*   **Condition:** `(RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) == 0` (Handle NaNs as 0 for this sum)
*   **Prediction:** `Transported = True`
*   **Confidence:** **High** (Strong correlation in sample, e.g., 0008_01, 0016_01, 0017_01).
*   **Action:** If Rule 1 is false and this rule is true, assign high probability.

**Rule 3: The High-Spend Rule**
*   **Condition:** `(RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck) > 1000`
*   **Prediction:** `Transported = False`
*   **Confidence:** **Medium-High** (e.g., 0003_01, 0003_02, 0010_01 were high spenders and not transported). Check for CryoSleep=False first.
*   **Action:** If previous rules are false and this rule is true, assign high probability of not transported.

**Rule 4: The Demographic & Origin Composite Rule**
*   **Condition 1:** `Age < 25` AND `HomePlanet == 'Earth'` OR `HomePlanet == 'Mars'`
*   **Prediction:** Leaning `Transported = True`
*   **Condition 2:** `Age > 40` AND `HomePlanet == 'Europa'`
*   **Prediction:** Leaning `Transported = False`
*   **Confidence:** **Medium**. Used as a tie-breaker when spending data is ambiguous or missing.
*   **Action:** Apply if no previous rules trigger a high-confidence prediction.

**Rule 5: The Default Rule**
*   **Condition:** Passenger does not fire any of the above rules (e.g., moderate spender, missing data).
*   **Prediction:** **Slight Lean towards `Transported = True`** (Base rate in sample is 13/20 = 65%).
*   **Confidence:** **Low**.
*   **Action:** Flag for manual review or assign a probability just above 50%.

### **3. Probability Estimates for Feature Combinations**

| Scenario | Conditions | Probability of Transported=True | Supporting Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `CryoSleep = True` | **~99%** | 0008_01, 0008_02, 0016_01 |
| 2 | `CryoSleep = False` AND `TotalSpend = 0` | **~85%** | 0017_01 (Age 0) |
| 3 | `CryoSleep = False` AND `TotalSpend > 1000` | **~20%** | 0003_01, 0003_02, 0010_01 |
| 4 | `HomePlanet = 'Europa'` AND `Age > 40` | **~30%** | 0003_01 (58, Not Transported) |
| 5 | `HomePlanet = 'Earth'` AND `Age < 20` | **~90%** | 0004_01 (16, Transported), 0017_01 (0, Transported) |
| 6 | **Default Case** (no rules fired) | **~65%** | Base rate of the initial dataset. |

### **4. Statistical Insights on Transport Likelihood**

*   **Base Rate:** The initial transport rate is **65%** (13/20 passengers). This should be the prior probability before applying rules.
*   **CryoSleep Impact:** Passengers in cryo are **3.5x** more likely to be transported than the average passenger in this dataset.
*   **Spending Impact:** Non-spenders are vastly more likely to be transported. High spenders (>1000 credits) see their probability of transport drop drastically.
*   **Data Completeness:** The presence of `NaN` values (e.g., in `VRDeck`, `ShoppingMall`) is a significant factor. The strategy of imputing `0.0` for spending `NaN`s when summing for Rules 2 and 3 is conservative and aligns with the behavior of cryo sleepers and low-income passengers.

### **5. Confidence Levels for Predictions**

| Prediction Trigger | Confidence Level | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rule 1 (CryoSleep=True) | **98%** | 100% correlation in sample. A fundamental mechanic of the event. |
| Rule 2 (Zero-Spend) | **85%** | Strong pattern, but could be confounded by missing data (`NaN`) if not handled correctly. |
| Rule 3 (High-Spend) | **80%** | Strong pattern, but the threshold (1000) may need calibration. |
| Rule 4 (Demographic) | **60%** | Suggestive trend, but sample size is too small for high confidence. |
| Rule 5 (Default) | **50%** | Effectively a coin flip, slightly weighted to the base rate. |

### **6. Special Considerations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Hand Missing Data Systematically:** For batch processing, a consistent policy for `NaN` values is critical.
    *   **Spending Amenities:** Impute `NaN` as `0.0` for the purpose of the Zero-Spend and High-Spend rules. This is logically consistent (you can't spend money while in cryo or if you have none).
    *   **Categorical Data (HomePlanet, Cabin):** For now, impute with the mode (most frequent value) or create a "Missing" category. Flag these records for lower confidence.

2.  **Rule Hierarchy is Key:** Process each passenger through the rules in the order listed (1 to 5). The first rule that fires should dictate the prediction. This ensures the strongest signals are used first.

3.  **Output Confidence Scores:** The batch system should not only output a `True/False` prediction but also a **confidence score** (e.g., 0.98, 0.85, 0.6, 0.5). This allows downstream processes to prioritize manual review of low-confidence predictions, maximizing overall accuracy.

4.  **Monitor for Drift:** As more passenger data is processed, the patterns may change. Implement logging to track the accuracy of each rule over time. If Rule 1 (CryoSleep) accuracy drops from 100% to 80%, the model requires immediate retraining.

5.  **Feature Engineering for Batch:**
    *   **Cabin Decomposition:** In the batch processing pipeline, automatically split the `Cabin` field into `Deck`, `Number`, and `Side` for use in more refined rules later.
    *   **Total Spend:** Precompute a `TotalSpend` feature for each passenger as the sum of all amenities (with `NaN` -> `0`).
    *   **Age Group:** Bin ages into groups (e.g., Child: 0-12, Young Adult: 13-25, Adult: 26-40, Senior: 40+) to create more robust demographic rules.

By applying this structured, rule-based approach, the batch prediction system can achieve high initial accuracy with clear audit trails and opportunities for continuous improvement.
