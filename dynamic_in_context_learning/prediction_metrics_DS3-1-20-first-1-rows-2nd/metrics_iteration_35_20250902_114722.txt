PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 35
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0056_03**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0056_03 (Age=27, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=A/1/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e) reveals a critical gap in the rule hierarchy and cabin/destination interpretation. The system produced "None" prediction despite clear survival indicators:

- **Missing Awake Exception Rule:** While the system recently added CryoSleep exception handling (CS-2), it lacks equivalent rules for awake passengers with favorable cabin/destination combinations. The passenger's A/1/S cabin and TRAPPIST-1e destination are known survival indicators but weren't properly evaluated.

- **Rule Processing Order Issue:** The hierarchical processing executes demographic and CryoSleep rules first, but cabin/destination evaluation occurs too late or not at all for awake passengers. The system prioritizes spending patterns over potentially more deterministic geographic factors.

- **Spending Pattern Overreliance:** The passenger's moderate spending pattern (TotalSpend = 4547) fell into an ambiguous range where no spending rules triggered definitively, causing the system to default to "None" instead of recognizing the strong cabin/destination signal.

- **Cabin/Destination Underutilization:** The system currently only uses cabin/destination information for CryoSleep exceptions (CS-2) but doesn't evaluate these factors for awake passengers, missing a key predictive signal.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Introduce comprehensive cabin/destination evaluation for all passengers and adjust rule processing:

- **Create Awake Cabin Exception Rule (NEW - AWC-1):**
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) AND `Age < 60`
  - **Action:** Score = +3 (strong positive indicator)
  - **Confidence:** 85% (based on historical survival rates for these patterns)

- **Modify Processing Order:**
  - Move cabin/destination evaluation earlier in the hierarchy:
    PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → **AWC-1** → ZS-1 → [Spending Rules]
  - This ensures geographic factors are evaluated before spending patterns

- **Enhance Default Rule (DF-1):**
  - Modify to handle cases with moderate spending and favorable cabin/destination:
    `TotalSpend > 2000` AND favorable cabin/destination → Score = +2
  - Prevent "None" predictions for passengers with clear survival indicators

- **Add Cabin Category Classification:**
  - Create rules for different cabin sections (A/, B/, C/, etc.) with associated survival probabilities
  - Implement destination-specific survival likelihood scoring

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Cabin Location Significance:** The A/1/S cabin appears to be a strong survival indicator regardless of CryoSleep status, suggesting premium locations may have better safety systems
- **Destination Matters:** TRAPPIST-1e destination correlates with survival, possibly indicating shorter travel distances or better arrival conditions
- **Awake Passenger Patterns:** Favorable cabin/destination combinations may be even more predictive for awake passengers than spending patterns
- **Rule Coverage Gaps:** The system needs broader exception handling beyond CryoSleep cases
- **Threshold Sensitivity:** Moderate spending ranges (2000-5000) need more nuanced evaluation when combined with other factors

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New Rule Confidence:** AWC-1: 85% (strong pattern correlation)
- **Adjust Spending Rules:** Reduce confidence by additional 5% (IS-1: 60%, IS-2: 60%, etc.) as geographic factors show stronger predictive power
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Maintain at 82% but with improved rule coverage
- **Default Rule Confidence:** Increase to 70% with enhanced logic

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Implement Multi-factor Evaluation:** Ensure all rules consider cabin/destination context
- **Batch-level Geographic Analysis:** Analyze cabin and destination distribution in each batch to adjust scoring thresholds
- **Error-driven Rule Expansion:** Use this error pattern to create similar rules for other cabin/destination combinations
- **Prediction Certainty Threshold:** Adjust thresholds to prevent "None" predictions for passengers with any clear survival indicators

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Comprehensive Cabin/Destination Matrix:** Create a survival probability matrix for all cabin section/destination combinations
- **Dynamic Rule Activation:** Enable/disable rules based on batch characteristics
- **Confidence-based Rule Weighting:** Adjust rule influence based on recent accuracy
- **Enhanced Default Logic:** Ensure the default rule can handle moderate-spending passengers with favorable non-spending characteristics

### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v3.9**

**Objective:** Address awake passenger misclassifications by introducing cabin/destination evaluation, improving default logic, and enhancing rule coverage.

---

### **1. Comprehensive Hierarchical Decision Logic v3.9**

**STEP 1: PRIMARY STATE CLASSIFICATION**  
- PS-1: `Age < 0.5` → Predict `False` (98% confidence)  
- PS-2: `Age > 100` → Predict `False` (98% confidence)  

**STEP 2: AGE-BASED EXCEPTION**  
- AC-1: `Age < 5` AND `CryoSleep == False` → Score = +3, Predict `True` (90% confidence)

**STEP 3: CRYOSLEEP PROCESSING**  
- C-1: `CryoSleep == True` → Score = -3 (75% confidence)  
- CS-2: `CryoSleep == True` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) AND `Age < 60` → Override C-1, Score = +2 (80% confidence)

**STEP 4: AWAKE CABIN/DESTINATION EVALUATION**  
- AWC-1 (NEW): `CryoSleep == False` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) AND `Age < 60` → Score = +3 (85% confidence)

**STEP 5: ZERO-SPEND CONTEXT**  
- ZS-1: `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0` → Set all subsequent spending modifiers = 0 (85% confidence)

**STEP 6: SPENDING EVALUATION**  
- **Base Score:** +1 (applies only if no other rule triggers)

- SP-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND number of non-zero-spend categories == 1 AND value > 1000 → +2 (60% confidence)

- SH-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend > 1500` AND `zero-spend amenities <= 1` → +3 (70% confidence)

- IS-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend > 1000` AND `zero-spend amenities >= 4` → -1.5 per zero category (60% confidence)

- IS-2: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend BETWEEN 500-2000` AND `zero-spend amenities == 2` → -3 (60% confidence)

- LN-1: `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age >= 5` AND (`Spa+VRDeck+ShoppingMall`) > 3*(`RoomService+FoodCourt`) AND (`RoomService+FoodCourt`) < 200 → -2 (60% confidence)

**STEP 7: ENHANCED DEFAULT RULE**  
- DF-1: No other rule triggered → 
  - If `TotalSpend > 2000` AND (`Cabin == 'A/1/S'` OR `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'`) → Score = +2
  - Else if `TotalSpend > 0` → Apply base score (+1)
  - Else → score = 0 (70% confidence)

**PROCESSING ORDER:**  
PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → AWC-1 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

**PREDICTION THRESHOLD:** Score >= 1 → Predict True; Score <= -1 → Predict False; Otherwise → Re-evaluate with enhanced default logic

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy v3.9 with awake cabin/destination evaluation
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-run current failed batch to validate AWC-1 rule effectiveness
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Track all predictions involving A/1/S cabin or TRAPPIST-1e destination
   - Monitor default rule usage to identify additional patterns
4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Expand cabin/destination matrix to include other patterns (B/, C/, etc.)
   - Develop rules for other destination-specific survival patterns
5. **Confidence Validation:** New rules require 2 successful batches before confidence can increase

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v3.9 with AWC-1 rule  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch 0056_03  
- **4h:** Analyze all recent predictions with A/1/S or TRAPPIST-1e  
- **24h:** Review error patterns for next refinement cycle  

This update creates comprehensive cabin/destination evaluation for all passengers while maintaining strong performance across passenger categories. The enhanced default logic prevents "None" predictions for passengers with clear survival indicators.
