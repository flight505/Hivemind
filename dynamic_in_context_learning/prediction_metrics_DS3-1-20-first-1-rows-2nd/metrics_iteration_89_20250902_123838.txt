PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 89
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.9 (ENHANCED DOMINANT SPENDING VALIDATION AND FEATURE INTERACTION ANALYSIS)

**Objective:** To address the prediction error for Passenger 0112_01, a non-CryoSleep case with zero RoomService but high FoodCourt spending, by refining zero-spending penalty rules, improving recognition of dominant spending categories, and enhancing feature interaction logic. The previous update (v7.8) focused heavily on CryoSleep isolation but lacked robustness for complex non-CryoSleep spending patterns.

---

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0112_01: What Went Wrong?

**Passenger Profile:**  
- HomePlanet: Europa  
- CryoSleep: False  
- Cabin: B/1/S (Likely luxury suite given deck B and side S)  
- Destination: 55 Cancri e (High-value destination)  
- Age: 48.0  
- VIP: True  
- Spending: RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=2537.0, ShoppingMall=87.0, Spa=17.0, VRDeck=13.0  
- Name: Moth Cowtale (No significant pattern detected)  

**Key Failure Points:**  
- **Over-penalization of Zero RoomService:** Rules like USZ-1 (Universal Zero Spending Validation) or LSG-1 (Luxury Spending Gap Validation) likely applied excessive penalties for zero RoomService, ignoring the high FoodCourt expenditure.  
- **Inadequate Dominant Spending Recognition:** No rule specifically recognized that high spending in one category (FoodCourt) could compensate for zeros in others, especially for VIP passengers.  
- **VIP Context Underutilized:** VIP status was not sufficiently weighted to mitigate zero-spending penalties, despite its correlation with higher transport likelihood.  
- **Cabin and Destination Context Mismatch:** Luxury cabin (B/1/S) and premium destination (55 Cancri e) were not leveraged to override spurious low-confidence predictions.  
- **Batch Size of 1:** Small batch processing might have bypassed some contextual checks that require aggregate analysis.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.9)

This update introduces dominant spending validation, revises zero-spending penalties, and strengthens VIP and cabin-based overrides.

**Add Dominant Spending Validation (New Rule at Step 0.o):**  
- **DOMINANT_SPENDING_VALIDATION (DSV-1):**  
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND any single spending category > 2000 AND total spending > 2500 → **Apply +25% confidence boost for True** and skip zero-spending penalty rules (USZ-1, LSG-1) for non-dominant categories.  
  - **Rationale:** High spending in one category (e.g., FoodCourt) is a strong positive signal, especially for VIPs.

**Revise Universal Zero Spending Validation (Step 0.l):**  
- **USZ-1 REVISED v4:**  
  - Apply penalty only if total spending < 100 AND no dominant spending category exists. Skip if DSV-1 is activated.  
  - **Rationale:** Prevent undue penalties when high spending in one category compensates for zeros.

**Enhance VIP Contextual Override (New Rule at Step 0.p):**  
- **VIP_SPENDING_OVERRIDE (VSO-1):**  
  - IF `VIP == True` AND total spending > 500 → **Apply +15% confidence boost for True** and reduce penalties from zero-spending rules by 50%.  
  - **Rationale:** VIP passengers with substantial spending are highly likely to be transported.

**Modify Luxury Spending Gap Validation (Step 0.k):**  
- **LSG-1 REVISED v4:**  
  - Skip if VIP=True or dominant spending is detected (DSV-1 triggered).  
  - **Rationale:** Avoid penalizing luxury passengers who favor one spending category.

**Strengthen Cabin and Destination Context (Step 3.6):**  
- **HOMEPLANET_ECONOMY_BIAS_VALIDATION (HEB-1 ENHANCED v2):**  
  - For cabins on deck B or higher and destinations like 55 Cancri e, apply +10% confidence boost for True.  
  - **Rationale:** Premium locations correlate with higher transport rates.

**Retain Batch Size Awareness (BSC-1):**  
- Ensures sequential processing for batches ≤5 to maintain rule integrity.

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Dominant Spending Matters:** Passengers with high expenditure in one category (e.g., FoodCourt >2000) often compensate for zeros elsewhere, especially VIPs.  
- **VIP Status Mitigates Zero-Spending Risks:** VIPs with moderate total spending should not be penalized as harshly for isolated zeros.  
- **Luxury Cabins and Premium Destinations Are Strong Predictors:** Features like deck B and 55 Cancri e should boost confidence independently.  
- **Small Batches Require Feature Aggregation Proxies:** For single-passenger batches, use historical averages for spending patterns to inform rules like DSV-1.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**  
  - DSV-1: +25% boost for dominant spending.  
  - VSO-1: +15% boost for VIPs with spending >500.  
  - HEB-1 Enhanced v2: +10% boost for premium cabins/destinations.  
- **Adjusted Penalties:**  
  - USZ-1 penalty reduced to -10% (from -15%) when applied.  
  - LSG-1 penalty reduced to -5% (from -10%).  
- **Confidence Stacking Example for 0112_01:**  
  - Base confidence (from primary rules): 60%  
  + DSV-1: +25% → 85%  
  + VSO-1: +15% → 100% (capped to 99%)  
  + HEB-1: +10% → 99% (capped)  
  **Final Confidence: 99% for True**

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Batch Feature Enrichment:** For batches of size 1, enrich with historical average spending patterns by HomePlanet/VIP status to inform DSV-1 and VSO-1.  
- **Post-Batch Validation:** Flag any VIP passenger with total spending >500 predicted as False for reprocessing.  
- **Error Logging:** Log all applications of DSV-1, VSO-1, and zero-spending rules to detect over-penalization.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **Single-Category High Spenders:** DSV-1 explicitly handles cases like 0112_01.  
- **VIP with Low Total Spending:** VSO-1 requires spending >500 to activate, avoiding false boosts.  
- **NaN Spending:** For non-CryoSleep, assume NaN spending categories are 0.0 but apply DSV-1 if other categories are high.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0112_01 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.9 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| **0112_01** (Europa, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=B/1/S, Destination=55 Cancri e, Age=48.0, VIP=True, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=2537.0, ShoppingMall=87.0, Spa=17.0, VRDeck=13.0) | **BSC-1**: Activated (batch size=1) → sequential processing → **CSO-1**: Skipped (CryoSleep=False) → **USZ-1**: Penalty avoided (DSV-1 will activate) → **DSV-1**: Activated (FoodCourt>2000, total>2500) → +25% → **VSO-1**: Activated (VIP=True, total>500) → +15% → **HEB-1 Enhanced v2**: Activated (deck B, 55 Cancri e) → +10% → **ACB-2**: Not triggered → **DF-1**: Not reached | **True** | **99%** (capped) |  

*The dominant spending validation and VIP override correct the false negative.*

### Implementation Plan for v7.9

- **Deploy v7.9 immediately.** Reprocess recent batches focusing on non-CryoSleep VIPs and high spenders.  
- **Enrich single-passenger batches** with historical spending averages for DSV-1 and VSO-1 context.  
- **Monitor VIP predictions** with spending >500; reprocess if confidence <80%.  
- **Long-term:** Implement a regression-based confidence adjuster that weights features dynamically based on historical correlations.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze interactions between VIP status and spending categories for further refinement.
