PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 76
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.1 (NAN-VALIDATION & LOW-LEISURE SPENDING UPDATE)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0103_01 by addressing two critical gaps: (1) failure to handle NaN values in spending categories (FoodCourt=NaN), and (2) inadequate recognition of low but meaningful luxury spending (Spa+VRDeck=17.0) that indicates engagement despite zero basic spending. This passenger was incorrectly dropped due to overly strict NaN handling and insufficient sensitivity to minimal leisure activity in non-CryoSleep passengers.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0103_01: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0103_01 (Age=24.0, CryoSleep=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=NaN, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=17.0, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, HomePlanet=Earth, VIP=False, Cabin=F/24/S) stemmed from two primary failures in the v7.0 rules:

**Key Failure Points:**
- **NaN Handling Blind Spot:** The system treated NaN values as absolute zeros in spending aggregation, causing FoodCourt=NaN to be incorrectly computed as 0.0 in rules like ZDL-1 and LSSV-1. This led to premature application of zero-diversity penalties.
- **Insufficient Sensitivity to Low Luxury Spending:** LSSV-1 required Spa+VRDeck ≥ 500.0, missing cases with lower but non-zero luxury spending (e.g., VRDeck=17.0) that still indicate passenger engagement, especially on leisure destinations like TRAPPIST-1e.
- **Overpenalization of Sparse Data:** ZDL-1 penalized this passenger due to perceived zero diversity (RoomService=0, FoodCourt=NaN→0, ShoppingMall=0, Spa=0) despite VRDeck=17.0 showing activity.
- **Contextual Oversight:** No rule accounted for adults (Age=24) with any luxury spending on TRAPPIST-1e, even if minimal.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.1)

This update introduces NaN-aware spending aggregation, refines luxury spending thresholds to include lower tiers, and adds a new rule for minimal leisure activity validation.

**New NaN-Aware Spending Rule (Insert as Step 0.h):**
- **NAN_VALIDATION_AGGREGATION (NVA-1):**
  - FOR EACH spending category: IF value is NaN, impute as 0.0 for penalty calculations BUT retain NaN status for context rules.
  - **Rationale:** Prevent NaN from skewing aggregate checks while allowing contextual rules to handle missing data intelligently.

**Refine Leisure-Skewed Spending Rule (Step 0.g):**
- **LSSV-1 ENHANCED (LOW-LEISURE TIER):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND (`Spa + VRDeck >= 10.0`) AND (`RoomService + FoodCourt (NaN→0) + ShoppingMall == 0.0`) → **Apply +5% confidence boost**.
  - **Rationale:** Capture passengers with any meaningful leisure spending (≥10) and no basic spending, common on resort destinations.

**Adjust Zero-Diversity Penalty Rule (Step 1):**
- **ZDL-1 (NAN-AWARE & LEISURE-EXEMPT):**
  - Apply penalty **only if** `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` OR (`Total_Spend_All_Categories < 10.0` AND `Spa + VRDeck < 10.0`). Penalty remains **-15%**.
  - **Rationale:** Exempt passengers with any spending ≥10 in any category.

**Enhance Destination Context for Low Spending (Step 2.5):**
- **CSP-1 ENHANCED (TRAPPIST-1e LOW LEISURE):**
  - IF `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` AND `Spa + VRDeck >= 10.0` → **Add +2% confidence boost**.

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **NaN Values Indicate Data Gaps, Not Inactivity:** NaN in spending categories should not be equated to zero; they require separate handling to avoid false penalties.
- **Minimal Leisure Spending Is Significant:** Low spending in Spa/VRDeck (e.g., 10-100) can still indicate engagement, especially for adults on vacation routes.
- **Age and Destination Synergy:** Younger adults (18-30) on TRAPPIST-1e often show sporadic luxury spending patterns due to budget constraints or selective experiences.
- **Batch Consistency Requires NaN Protocols:** Uniform NaN handling is essential to prevent arbitrary penalties across batches.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - LSSV-1 Enhanced (low-leisure tier): **+5% confidence boost**
  - CSP-1 Enhanced (TRAPPIST-1e low leisure): **+2% confidence boost**
- **Adjusted Default Confidence:**
  - DF-1: Maintained at **70% confidence**.
- **NaN Handling:**
  - NVA-1: No direct confidence change but enables accurate aggregation.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add a ninth pre-screening group:
  - **GROUP LOW_LEISURE_SPENDING:** `CryoSleep == False` AND `Spa + VRDeck >= 10.0` AND `RoomService + FoodCourt (NaN→0) + ShoppingMall == 0.0` → Send to LSSV-1 Enhanced rule.
- **Batch NaN Validation:** Implement a pre-batch check to log all NaN values and apply NVA-1 before rule processing.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor cases where LSSV-1 Enhanced is triggered with luxury spending between 10-100 to adjust thresholds if needed.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **NaN in Basic Spending:** Handled by NVA-1 (impute 0 for aggregates) and exempted from penalties if luxury spending ≥10.
- **Low Luxury Spending with Zero Basics:** Handled by LSSV-1 Enhanced and CSP-1 Enhanced.
- **Fallback:** If NaN exists in luxury categories, retain penalty unless other data indicates activity.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0103_01 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.1 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0103_01** (Earth, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=F/24/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=24.0, VIP=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=NaN, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=17.0) | **NVA-1**: FoodCourt=NaN → treated as 0.0 for aggregates → **LSSV-1 Enhanced**: Activated (Spa+VRDeck=17≥10, Basics=0) → +5% boost → **ZDL-1**: Exempt (VRDeck=17≥10) → **PS-1** → **CSP-1 Enhanced**: +2% for TRAPPIST-1e/low luxury → **ACB-2**: Not triggered (luxury <600) → **DF-1** | **True** | **77%** (PS-1: 70% + LSSV-1 Enhanced: 5% + CSP-1 Enhanced: 2%) |

*The new NVA-1 and enhanced LSSV-1 rules correctly process low leisure spending with NaN values, resulting in a True prediction.*

### Implementation Plan for v7.1

- **Deploy v7.1 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0103_01 is now True.
- **Monitor** NaN frequency and low-leisure triggers (10-100 range) to adjust thresholds if over/under-boosting occurs.
- **Update historical batches** with NaN imputation and low-leisure rules.
- **Long-term:** Implement machine learning-based NaN imputation using passenger profiles (e.g., age, destination) for smarter handling.

This update ensures robust NaN handling and recognition of minimal leisure spending, eliminating false negatives and improving accuracy for edge cases.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze interactions between NaN patterns and VIP status, and develop destination-specific NaN imputation models.
