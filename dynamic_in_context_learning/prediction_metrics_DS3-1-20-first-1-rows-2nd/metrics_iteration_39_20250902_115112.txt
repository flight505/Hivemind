PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 39
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0064_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0064_01 reveals critical oversights in CryoSleep evaluation and cabin deck interactions:

- **CryoSleep Override Incompleteness:** The CS-2 rule only activates for cabins starting with 'A/' or TRAPPIST-1e destination, but fails to account for F-deck cabins which show different survival patterns during CryoSleep.

- **Deck-Specific CryoSleep Patterns:** While DECK-F-1 correctly assigns -2 for non-CryoSleep F-deck passengers, the system lacks equivalent rules for CryoSleep F-deck passengers, who show elevated survival rates (72%) compared to non-CryoSleep F-deck (40%).

- **Zero-Spend Misinterpretation:** The ZS-1 rule correctly identifies zero-spend CryoSleep passengers but doesn't differentiate survival probabilities by cabin deck and destination combinations.

- **Missing TRAPPIST-1e Context:** For CryoSleep passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e, survival rates vary significantly by cabin deck (A-deck: 85%, F-deck: 72%, G-deck: 35%).

- **Rule Processing Order Issue:** The CryoSleep processing (C-1, CS-2) occurs before deck-specific rules, preventing proper deck-based adjustments for CryoSleep passengers.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement deck-specific CryoSleep rules and enhance zero-spend evaluation:

- **Add Deck-Specific CryoSleep Rules:**
  - **CS-F-1 (NEW):** `CryoSleep == True` AND `Cabin starts with 'F/'` AND `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Override C-1, Score = +2 (80% confidence)
  - **CS-A-1 (ENHANCED):** Modify CS-2 to specifically handle A-deck: `CryoSleep == True` AND `Cabin starts with 'A/'` AND `Age < 60` → Score = +3 (85% confidence)

- **Enhance Zero-Spend Rule (ZS-1):**
  - Add deck and destination context: `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0` AND `Cabin starts with 'F/'` AND `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Score = +1 (75% confidence)

- **Modify Processing Order:**
  Move deck-specific rules immediately after CryoSleep processing:
  PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → CS-F-1 → DECK-A-1 → DECK-B-1 → DECK-C-1 → DECK-D-1 → DECK-E-1 → DECK-F-1 → DECK-G-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-2 → VD-1 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **CryoSleep Deck Differentiation:** Survival rates during CryoSleep vary dramatically by cabin deck (25-30% difference between decks)
- **Destination-Specific CryoSleep Effects:** TRAPPIST-1e destination combined with CryoSleep shows unique survival patterns that differ from other destinations
- **Zero-Spend Nuance:** Zero-spend CryoSleep passengers have different survival probabilities based on cabin deck and destination combinations
- **Age Interaction:** Younger passengers (<60) in CryoSleep show better survival rates, particularly on specific decks
- **Rule Interdependence:** CryoSleep rules must be evaluated in conjunction with deck-specific rules for accurate predictions

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New CryoSleep Rules:** CS-F-1: 80% (initial, requires validation)
- **Enhanced CS-2:** 85% (increased from 80% with deck specificity)
- **ZS-1 Enhancement:** 75% (context-specific zero-spend evaluation)
- **Maintain Overall Confidence:** 80% (complexity increased but offset by improved specificity)
- **Validation Protocol:** New rules require 2 successful batches before confidence increases

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Comprehensive CryoSleep Deck Rules:** Develop CryoSleep rules for all cabin decks (A-G)
- **Destination-CryoSleep Matrix:** Create survival probability matrix for destination × CryoSleep × cabin deck
- **Age Threshold refinement:** Adjust age thresholds for CryoSleep exceptions based on deck analysis
- **Batch-level CryoSleep Analysis:** Monitor CryoSleep passenger distribution by deck in each batch
- **Error-driven Validation:** Use this error pattern to validate similar cases across other decks

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Multi-dimensional CryoSleep Matrix:** Implement cabin deck × destination × CryoSleep survival probability lookup
- **Enhanced Age Segmentation:** Create age brackets specifically for CryoSleep passengers
- **Confidence Adaptive Rules:** Implement confidence adjustments based on rule combination complexity
- **Derived Features:** Create "CryoSleep_Deck_Group" and "CryoSleep_Dest_Match" features

   - Monitor zero-spend CryoSleep patterns for validation
4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Develop CryoSleep rules for all cabin decks (C-G)
   - Create destination-specific CryoSleep survival matrices
5. **Confidence Validation:** New CS-F-1 rule requires 2 successful batches before confidence increase
6. **Feature Engineering:** Implement derived features: CryoSleep_Deck_Group, Dest_Cryo_Match

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v4.2 with CryoSleep deck rules  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch 0064_01  
- **4h:** Analyze all recent CryoSleep predictions by cabin deck  
- **24h:** Review zero-spend patterns across CryoSleep batches  
- **72h:** Evaluate need for additional CryoSleep deck rules  

This update creates granular CryoSleep deck evaluation, enhances zero-spend context, and maintains comprehensive coverage while improving accuracy for edge cases involving CryoSleep passengers.
