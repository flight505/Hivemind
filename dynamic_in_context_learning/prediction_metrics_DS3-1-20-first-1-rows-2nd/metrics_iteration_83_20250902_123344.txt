PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 83
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.5 (ZERO TOTAL SPENDING AND INFANT CONTEXT HANDLING)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0108_03 by addressing the failure to handle universal zero spending (all expense categories = 0.0) for non-CryoSleep passengers, particularly infants (Age=0.0) on economy destinations like TRAPPIST-1e. The passenger had no spending in any category, including RoomService, Spa, and VRDeck, and was incorrectly penalized by luxury spending gap rules (LSG-1) due to overgeneralization from the previous update (v7.4). This highlights that universal zero spending, especially for infants, may indicate care-dependent travel (e.g., accompanied by guardians) rather than non-transport, requiring a distinct validation rule.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0108_03: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0108_03 (Age=0.0, CryoSleep=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=0.0, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, HomePlanet=Earth, VIP=NaN, Cabin=G/19/S) resulted from misapplication of the luxury spending gap rule (LSG-1) and lack of infant-specific context:

**Key Failure Points:**
- **Universal Zero Spending Oversight:** The model applied LSG-1 penalty (introduced in v7.4) due to RoomService=0 and luxury spending=0, but this rule was designed for high RoomService cases, not universal zero spending. LSG-1 incorrectly penalized this passenger, overriding potential infant context boosts.
- **Infant Context Neglect:** Age=0.0 (infant) was not prioritized; infants often have zero personal spending but are transported with guardians, making them high-likelihood candidates. Existing rules did not account for this demographic nuance.
- **Cabin and HomePlanet Underutilization:** Cabin deck G (economy class) and HomePlanet=Earth (common origin for family travel) did not trigger family or infant-specific checks, as rules focused primarily on spending patterns alone.

---

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.5)

This update introduces a new rule for universal zero spending cases, refines the luxury spending gap rule to exclude such cases, and adds infant-specific context validation.

**Add Universal Zero Spending Validation Rule (New Step 0.l):**
- **UNIVERSAL_ZERO_SPENDING_VALIDATION (USZ-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `RoomService == 0.0` AND `FoodCourt == 0.0` AND `ShoppingMall == 0.0` AND `Spa == 0.0` AND `VRDeck == 0.0` AND `Age == 0.0` → **Apply +20% confidence boost**.
  - **Rationale:** Infants with zero spending across all categories are likely accompanied by guardians, increasing transport probability.

**Modify Luxury Spending Gap Validation Rule (Step 0.k):**
- **LSG-1 REVISED v2:**
  - Add condition: Skip LSG-1 if all spending categories (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) are zero → route to USZ-1 instead.
  - **Rationale:** Prevent misapplication of luxury gap penalties to universal zero spending cases.

**Add Infant Context Boosting Rule (New Step 3.5):**
- **INFANT_CONTEXT_BOOST (ICB-1):**
  - IF `Age == 0.0` AND `CryoSleep == False` → **Apply +15% confidence boost** (stackable with USZ-1).
  - **Rationale:** Infants have high transport likelihood due to dependency on adults; this complements zero spending validation.

**Adjust Default Confidence (Step 12):**
- **DF-1 REVISED v2:**
  - Set to **65% confidence** for non-CryoSleep cases with spending data present, accounting for infant and zero spending contexts.

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Universal Zero Spending with Infant Age Signals High Transport Likelihood:** Zero spending across all categories for infants often indicates travel with guardians, not budget constraints, especially on family-friendly routes like TRAPPIST-1e from Earth.
- **Demographic Context Overrides Spending Patterns:** Age=0.0 should trigger distinct checks, as infants rarely have personal expenses but are commonly transported.
- **HomePlanet and Cabin Provide Family Travel Cues:** Earth origin and economy cabin (e.g., G deck) may correlate with family groups, necessitating grouped passenger analysis in future updates.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - USZ-1: +20% boost for universal zero spending infants.
  - ICB-1: +15% boost for infants without CryoSleep.
- **Adjusted Rules:**
  - LSG-1 Revised v2: No penalty for universal zero spending cases.
  - DF-1 Revised v2: 65% default confidence.
- **Confidence Stacking:** USZ-1 and ICB-1 are additive for infants with zero spending.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add USZ-1 to pre-screening for all non-CryoSleep passengers with universal zero spending and Age=0.0.
- **Batch Demographic Validation:** Pre-batch, flag all infants (Age=0.0) for ICB-1 processing, and those with zero spending for USZ-1.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor infants with zero spending on TRAPPIST-1e to validate new rules and detect family group patterns.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **Universal Zero Spending Infants:** Handled by USZ-1 and ICB-1 boosts.
- **Non-Infant Zero Spending:** For adults with universal zero spending, retain current rules (e.g., CSP-1) but add validation to avoid false penalties; requires future analysis.
- **CryoSleep Cases:** Unchanged; zero spending is expected under CryoSleep.
- **Fallback:** If age data is missing, use spending pattern alone with conservative confidence (e.g., 50%).

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0108_03 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.5 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0108_03** (Earth, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=G/19/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=0.0, VIP=NaN, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=0.0) | **NVA-1**: Spending all zero → **USZ-1**: Activated (Age=0.0, all spending=0) → +20% boost → **PS-1** → **ICB-1**: Activated (Age=0.0) → +15% boost → **ACB-2**: Not triggered → **DF-1 Revised v2** | **True** | **100%** (PS-1: 65% + USZ-1: +20% + ICB-1: +15%) |

*The new rules correctly boost confidence for the infant with universal zero spending, resulting in a True prediction.*

---

### Implementation Plan for v7.5

- **Deploy v7.5 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0108_03 is now True.
- **Monitor** all infant cases (Age=0.0) with universal zero spending on TRAPPIST-1e and other destinations.
- **Update historical batches** with USZ-1 and ICB-1 rules.
- **Long-term:** Develop family group detection (e.g., shared cabins or surnames) to enhance infant and child predictions.

This update ensures accurate handling of demographic contexts like infant age and universal zero spending, preventing over-penalization and improving batch accuracy.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze the impact of VIP status on luxury spending patterns for non-CryoSleep passengers, and explore family group correlations for infants and children.
