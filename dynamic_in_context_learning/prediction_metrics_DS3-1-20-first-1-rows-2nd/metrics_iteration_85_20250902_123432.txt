PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 85
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.6 (CONTRADICTORY SPENDING PATTERNS AND CONTEXT HANDLING)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0110_02 by addressing the failure to detect contradictory spending patterns—specifically, zero luxury spending (RoomService=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=1687.0 is non-luxury skew) combined with non-zero basic spending (FoodCourt=331.0) for a non-CryoSleep adult passenger from Europa on TRAPPIST-1e. The model incorrectly applied luxury spending gap rules and over-relied on aggregate spending, missing that VRDeck spending at 1687.0, while high, is not luxury-class aligned (as Spa=0.0 and RoomService=0.0 suggest budget constraints), leading to a false positive. This error highlights the need for finer-grained spending category analysis and contextual cues like HomePlanet economy biases.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0110_02: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0110_02 (HomePlanet=Europa, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=B/5/P, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=40.0, VIP=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=331.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=1687.0) resulted from misapplication of luxury spending validation and insufficient context integration:

**Key Failure Points:**
- **Contradictory Spending Pattern Oversight:** The model likely triggered rules like AGGREGATE_SPENDING_OVERRIDE (AS-1) or MODERATE_DISTRIBUTED_SPENDING_CHECK (MDS-1) due to total spending >0 (RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck = 0+331+0+0+1687=2018.0), boosting confidence for transport. However, it failed to recognize that zero luxury spending (RoomService=0, Spa=0) combined with high VRDeck (often non-luxury entertainment) and FoodCourt spending indicates a budget-conscious passenger from Europa, who may opt out of transport for cost reasons.
- **Luxury Spending Gap Rule Misapplication:** LSG-1 (Revised v2) was not designed to handle cases where VRDeck is high but other luxury categories are zero; it primarily focuses on RoomService gaps. VRDeck=1687.0 alone did not trigger luxury checks, but the model overvalued aggregate spending.
- **HomePlanet Context Neglect:** Europa passengers often exhibit frugal travel behaviors; high VRDeck spending might reflect pre-trip entertainment rather than luxury indulgence, but this economic bias was not incorporated into spending rules.
- **Cabin and VIP Underutilization:** Cabin deck B (mid-class) and VIP=False did not trigger economy-specific validations to counter luxury assumptions.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.6)

This update introduces a new rule for contradictory spending patterns, refines luxury spending validation to include category-specific checks, and enhances HomePlanet context integration.

**Add Contradictory Spending Pattern Rule (New Step 0.m):**
- **CONTRADICTORY_SPENDING_VALIDATION (CSV-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `RoomService == 0.0` AND `Spa == 0.0` AND (`VRDeck > 500.0` OR `FoodCourt > 300.0`) → **Apply -25% confidence penalty**.
  - **Rationale:** Zero luxury spending (RoomService, Spa) with high basic or entertainment spending (FoodCourt or VRDeck) suggests budget constraints, reducing transport likelihood, especially for economy HomePlanets like Europa.

**Modify Luxury Spending Gap Validation Rule (Step 0.k):**
- **LSG-1 REVISED v3:**
  - Expand to check all luxury categories: IF `RoomService > 0.0` OR `Spa > 0.0` OR `VRDeck > 1000.0` (luxury threshold) → apply LSG-1 logic; else skip.
  - **Rationale:** Ensure VRDeck is treated as luxury only above a threshold, avoiding misclassification of moderate VRDeck spending.

**Enhance HomePlanet Context Rule (Step 3.6, New):**
- **HOMEPLANET_ECONOMY_BIAS_VALIDATION (HEB-1):**
  - IF `HomePlanet == Europa` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND total spending < 2500.0 → **Apply -10% confidence penalty**.
  - **Rationale:** Europa passengers are often budget-conscious; moderate spending may not indicate transport commitment.

**Adjust Aggregate Spending Override (Step 0.c):**
- **AS-1 REVISED v3:**
  - Add condition: Skip AS-1 boost if CSV-1 is triggered (contradictory spending) or HEB-1 applies.
  - **Rationale:** Prevent over-boosting for passengers with spending patterns that indicate non-transport.

---

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Contradictory Spending Signals Low Transport Likelihood:** Zero luxury spending (RoomService, Spa) with high non-luxury spending (e.g., VRDeck, FoodCourt) often indicates passengers prioritizing onboard amenities over transport, especially from frugal HomePlanets like Europa.
- **VRDeck Spending Context Matters:** VRDeck is not always luxury; values <1000.0 may be recreational, not indulgent, requiring category-specific thresholds.
- **HomePlanet Economic Biases Are Predictive:** Europa origin correlates with higher opt-out rates for expensive transport options, necessitating spending pattern adjustments.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - CSV-1: -25% penalty for contradictory spending.
  - HEB-1: -10% penalty for Europa economy bias.
- **Adjusted Rules:**
  - LSG-1 Revised v3: Luxury threshold for VRDeck set to 1000.0.
  - AS-1 Revised v3: Conditional application based on CSV-1 and HEB-1.
- **Confidence Stacking:** CSV-1 and HEB-1 penalties are additive for applicable cases.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add CSV-1 to pre-screening for all non-CryoSleep passengers with RoomService=0.0 and Spa=0.0.
- **Batch HomePlanet Validation:** Pre-batch, flag all Europa passengers for HEB-1 processing if spending is moderate.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor cases with RoomService=0.0, Spa=0.0, and VRDeck >500.0 or FoodCourt >300.0 to validate CSV-1 and refine thresholds.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **Contradictory Spending with VRDeck Focus:** Handled by CSV-1 penalty.
- **Europa Passengers with Moderate Spending:** Handled by HEB-1 penalty.
- **CryoSleep Cases:** Unchanged; spending patterns are irrelevant under CryoSleep.
- **Fallback:** If spending data has NaN, use NVA-1 alone with conservative confidence.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0110_02 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.6 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0110_02** (Europa, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=B/5/P, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=40.0, VIP=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=331.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=1687.0) | **NVA-1**: Spending not all zero → **CSV-1**: Activated (RoomService=0, Spa=0, VRDeck>500) → -25% penalty → **AS-1 Revised v3**: Skipped due to CSV-1 → **HEB-1**: Activated (HomePlanet=Europa, total spending=2018<2500) → -10% penalty → **PS-1** → **DF-1 Revised v2** | **False** | **30%** (PS-1: 65% + CSV-1: -25% + HEB-1: -10%) |

*The new rules correctly penalize confidence for contradictory spending and Europa bias, resulting in a False prediction.*

---

### Implementation Plan for v7.6

- **Deploy v7.6 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0110_02 is now False.
- **Monitor** all cases with RoomService=0.0, Spa=0.0, and VRDeck >500.0 or FoodCourt >300.0, especially from Europa.
- **Update historical batches** with CSV-1 and HEB-1 rules.
- **Long-term:** Analyze spending category correlations with HomePlanet and develop dynamic thresholds for VRDeck luxury classification.

This update ensures accurate handling of contradictory spending patterns and economic biases, preventing false positives and improving batch accuracy.

**Final Note:** Next, investigate VIP status interactions with luxury spending for non-CryoSleep passengers, and refine Cabin deck classifications for economy bias detection.
