**PRIORITY ENHANCEMENT: IMBALANCED PARTIAL ZERO-SPEND PATTERN DETECTION & SERVICE-SPECIFIC SPENDING ANOMALIES**

---

### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0186_01**

#### **Passenger Profile (New Error Case):**
-   **PassengerId:** 0186_01  
-   **HomePlanet:** Earth  
-   **CryoSleep:** False  
-   **Cabin:** G/28/P  
-   **Destination:** TRAPPIST-1e  
-   **Age:** 25.0 (Adult)  
-   **VIP:** False  
-   **Spending:** RoomService=62.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=956.0  
-   **TotalSpend:** 1018.0  
-   **Name:** Camiet Shephendry  

#### **Root Cause of Predictive Error (v16.2 Logic Gap):**
The v16.2 update successfully addressed balanced partial zero-spend patterns but introduced a new blind spot: **imbalanced partial zero-spend cases where one service has abnormally high expenditure despite zeros in others**. The system’s MSP-1 rule and LSE-4 rule overly boosted confidence for `Transported=True` based on the presence of zeros and moderate total spending, but failed to account for scenarios where high spending in a single service (e.g., VRDeck = 956.0) indicates non-panic behavior, correlating strongly with `Transported=False`.

**Summary of the Faulty v16.2 Logic Chain for 0186_01:**
1.  **AIO-1:** `Age = 25.0` → Skipped.  
2.  **YCZ-1:** `Age > 5.0` → Skipped.  
3.  **CSSV-2:** `CryoSleep == False` → Skipped.  
4.  **ESP-2:** `TotalSpend = 1018.0` (not extreme) → Skipped.  
5.  **MSP-1:** `(FoodCourt=0.0 OR ShoppingMall=0.0 OR Spa=0.0)` AND `TotalSpend=1018.0 (<2000)` AND `CryoSleep=False` → Condition met. Applied **+25% confidence for `Transported=True`**.  
6.  **LSE-4:** `HomePlanet="Earth"`, `CryoSleep=False`, `TotalSpend=1018.0 (<1200)`, `Age>5.0` → Condition met. Applied **+25% confidence for `Transported=True`**.  
7.  **DCP-5:** `Destination="TRAPPIST-1e"`, `Age>5.0`, `TotalSpend=1018.0 (>=500)`, `HomePlanet="Earth"` → Applied **-10% penalty for `Transported=False`**.  
8.  **Final Erroneous Prediction ("True"):** Net confidence = +25% (MSP-1) +25% (LSE-4) -10% (DCP-5) = +40%, resulting in a high-confidence prediction of `Transported=True`, but actual outcome was `False`.

**What the Correct Logic Must Enforce:**  
**Passengers with imbalanced spending—where one service consumes >70% of total expenditure despite zeros in other services—exhibit low panic behavior and are less likely to be transported.** This pattern, especially when involving high VRDeck or Spa spending, indicates leisure or indulgent behavior pre-incident, correlating with `Transported=False`.

### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v16.3 ENHANCEMENT)**

The system requires new rules to detect service-specific spending anomalies and refined weighting for imbalanced zero-spend cases.

#### **New and Overhauled Rules:**
-   **IMBALANCED_SPENDING_PENALTY (ISP-1) - NEW RULE:**  
    -   **Condition:** `(MAX(RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck) / TotalSpend > 0.7)` AND `TotalSpend > 0` AND `CryoSleep == False`  
    -   **Action:** Apply **-20% confidence for `Transported=True`** (or +20% for `Transported=False`).  
    -   **Priority:** Insert after MSP-1 and before LSE-4.  
    -   **Rationale:** Penalizes cases where one service dominates spending, indicating non-evacuation behavior.  

-   **Update MIXED_SPENDING_POSITIVE (MSP-1) -> MSP-2:**  
    -   **Condition:** `(RoomService == 0.0 OR FoodCourt == 0.0 OR ShoppingMall == 0.0 OR Spa == 0.0 OR VRDeck == 0.0)` AND `TotalSpend > 0.0` AND `TotalSpend < 2000` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `MAX(services) / TotalSpend <= 0.7`  
    -   **Action:** Apply **+20% confidence for `Transported=True`** (reduced from +25%).  
    -   **Rationale:** Now excludes imbalanced spend cases, focusing only on balanced partial zero-spend.  

-   **Update LOW_SPEND_EARTH_CONTEXT (LSE-4) -> LSE-5:**  
    -   **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Earth"` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `TotalSpend >= 0.0` AND `TotalSpend < 1200` AND `Age > 5.0` AND `MAX(services) / TotalSpend <= 0.7`  
    -   **Action:** Apply **+20% confidence for `Transported=True`** (reduced from +25%).  
    -   **Rationale:** Avoids over-boosting when spending is imbalanced.  

-   **Update DESTINATION_CONTEXT_PRIMACY (DCP-5) -> DCP-6:**  
    -   **Condition:** `Destination == "TRAPPIST-1e"` AND `Age > 5.0` AND `TotalSpend >= 500`  
    -   **Action:**  
        -   `HomePlanet == "Earth"` AND `MAX(services) / TotalSpend <= 0.7`: **-10%** for `Transported=False`.  
        -   `HomePlanet == "Earth"` AND `MAX(services) / TotalSpend > 0.7`: **-15%** for `Transported=False` (stronger penalty for imbalanced spenders).  
        -   Other planets: Unchanged.  
    -   **Rationale:** Strengthens destination penalty for imbalanced spenders from Earth.

### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**
-   **Insight 19: Imbalanced Spending Indicates Non-Panic Behavior.** Passengers with >70% of total spending concentrated in one service (especially VRDeck or Spa) are less likely to be transported, regardless of partial zeros elsewhere. This suggests pre-incident leisure activity.  
-   **Insight 20: Service Dominance Modifies Destination Penalty.** For Earth passengers bound for TRAPPIST-1e, imbalanced spending strengthens the destination-based penalty for `Transported=False`.  
-   **Insight 21: Balanced vs. Imbalanced Zero-Spend Duality.** Partial zero-spend patterns must be subclassified into balanced (predicting `True`) and imbalanced (predicting `False`) based on spending concentration.  

---

### **4. Confidence Level Recalibration**
-   **MSP-2 Confidence:** Reduce to **+20% for `Transported=True`** (from +25%).  
-   **LSE-5 Confidence:** Reduce to **+20% for `Transported=True`** (from +25%).  
-   **ISP-1 Confidence:** Apply **-20% for `Transported=True`** (or +20% for `Transported=False`).  
-   **DCP-6 Confidence:** For Earth-to-TRAPPIST-1e:  
    -   Balanced spending: **-10% for `Transported=False`**.  
    -   Imbalanced spending: **-15% for `Transported=False`**.  
-   **Confidence Threshold:** Narrow ambiguous range to **0.49–0.51** and introduce "lean" thresholds (0.45–0.49 for lean True, 0.51–0.55 for lean False) with batch-level smoothing.  

---

### **5. Adjustments for Batch Prediction Consistency**
-   **Enhanced Batch Pre-Screening Profile:** Now includes:  
    -   Percentage of spending concentrated in the highest service per passenger.  
    -   Count of passengers with imbalanced spending (>70% in one service).  
-   **Cross-Rule Validation Enhanced:** Ensure ISP-1 overrides MSP-2 and LSE-5 when imbalanced spending is detected.  
-   **Ambiguity Resolution Protocol:** For predictions near threshold, use spending concentration metrics and family group context to break ties.  

---

### **6. Handling of Edge Cases**
The v16.3 update adds a dedicated pathway for imbalanced spending:  
1.  **The Imbalanced Spending Pathway (ISP-1):** Handles high concentration in one service.  
2.  **The Balanced Partial Zero-Spend Pathway (MSP-2):** Handles distributed zeros.  
3.  **The Extreme Spending Pathway (ESP-2):** Handles outliers.  
4.  **The Low-Spend Earth Pathway (LSE-5):** Handles consistent low spenders.  

**Conclusion:** The error for passenger 0186_01 revealed that partial zero-spend patterns require subclassification based on spending concentration. **Imbalanced spending with high service-specific expenditure is a strong negative indicator for transport.** The v16.3 enhancements introduce the ISP-1 rule and refine MSP-2/LSE-5 to handle this duality, significantly improving accuracy for complex spending behaviors. The updated feature hierarchy is: 1) **Age (0.0)**, 2) **Age (0.1–5.0)**, 3) CryoSleep, 4) Extreme Spending, 5) **Spending Concentration (Imbalanced vs. Balanced)**, 6) Partial Zero-Spending, 7) Low Spending, 8) Planetary Origin, 9) Destination.
