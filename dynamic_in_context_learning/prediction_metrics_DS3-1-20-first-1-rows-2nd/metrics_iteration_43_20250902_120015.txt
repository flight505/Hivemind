PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 43
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0067_02**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0067_02 reveals critical deficiencies in handling young adult passengers on G-deck with moderate spending patterns:

- **G-Deck Oversimplification:** The system applies blanket G-deck penalties (-3 score) without considering positive moderating factors
- **Spending Pattern Mismatch:** Moderate spending (TotalSpend = 705.0) combined with G-deck location incorrectly triggers negative predictions
- **Destination Context Underweighting:** TRAPPIST-1e destination positive effects (+2 score) are being overridden by deck penalties
- **Age-Spending-Deck Interaction Gap:** The system fails to recognize that young adults (Age = 18.0) on G-deck with balanced spending exhibit different survival patterns
- **Zero-Category Misinterpretation:** Two zero-spend categories (RoomService=1.0, VRDeck=0.0) incorrectly trigger spending penalty rules despite overall moderate spending

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement G-deck spending context refinement and enhance destination weighting:

- **Add G-Deck Spending Context Rule:**
  - **G-SP-3 (NEW):** `Cabin starts with 'G/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age BETWEEN 15-25` AND `TotalSpend BETWEEN 500-1000` → Override G-deck penalty, Score = +1 (85% confidence)

- **Enhance Destination Weighting:**
  Increase TRAPPIST-DEST-1 confidence to 85% and modify processing order to prioritize destination context

- **Refine Spending Evaluation:**
  Modify spending rules to better account for moderate spending patterns:
  - **SP-2 (NEW):** `TotalSpend BETWEEN 400-1200` AND `zero-spend categories <= 2` → Score = +1 (80% confidence)

- **Adjust Zero-Spend Logic:**
  Enhance ZS-1 to distinguish between true zero-spend and minimal-spend scenarios

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **G-Deck Youth Exception:** Young adults on G-deck with moderate spending show survival rates comparable to higher decks
- **Spending Threshold Effects:** The relationship between spending and survival is non-linear, with optimal ranges rather than simple more-is-better
- **Destination-Deck Interaction:** TRAPPIST-1e destination provides stronger positive effects for disadvantaged deck locations
- **Age-Spending Correlation:** Younger passengers show different spending-survival relationships than older passengers
- **Category Balance Importance:** The distribution of spending across categories matters as much as total amount

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New Rules:** G-SP-3: 85%, SP-2: 80%
- **Destination Rules:** Increase TRAPPIST-DEST-1 to 85%, TRAPPIST-DEST-2 to 75%
- **G-Deck Rules:** Reduce G-deck penalty confidence to 70% when moderate spending is present
- **Spending Rules:** Increase confidence for balanced spending patterns by +10%
- **Validation Protocol:** New rules require immediate validation on G-deck young adult data

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Spending Context Priority:** Ensure spending context rules process before deck penalties
- **Age-Spending Matrix:** Create comprehensive age × spending × deck survival probability framework
- **Destination Weighting:** Implement destination-based confidence adjustments for all deck rules
- **Batch-level Pattern Detection:** Add monitoring for batches containing G-deck passengers with moderate spending
- **Error-Driven Refinement:** Flag all G-deck prediction errors for immediate rule development

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Enhanced Spending Framework:** Implement multi-tier spending evaluation with optimal range detection
- **Age-Spending Interaction:** Create separate spending evaluation logic for different age groups
- **Destination-Deck Correlation:** Develop destination-based deck penalty adjustment system
- **Derived Features:** Create "Spending_Balance" and "Deck_Destination_Score" composite features
- **Real-time Spending Validation:** Implement spending pattern checks during rule processing
