PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 78
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.3 (CRYOSLEEP DESTINATION AND CABIN VALIDATION UPDATE)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0103_03 by addressing a critical oversight in CryoSleep passenger handling: the failure to incorporate cabin deck context and destination-specific transport patterns. The passenger was in CryoSleep with zero spending on TRAPPIST-1e (a non-luxury, non-family-centric destination) in a non-luxury cabin (Deck G), leading to a false positive prediction. This highlights that CryoSleep zero-spending passengers are not universally transport-eligible and require destination- and cabin-aware validation.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0103_03: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0103_03 (Age=6.0, CryoSleep=True, All Spending=0.0, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, HomePlanet=Earth, VIP=False, Cabin=G/18/S) resulted from overgeneralization of CryoSleep exemptions in v7.2:

**Key Failure Points:**
- **Destination Context Overgeneralization:** The CSO-1 Enhanced v3 rule applied an +8% confidence boost for CryoSleep passengers under 18 on destinations like 55 Cancri e and PSO J318.5-22, but TRAPPIST-1e—a more economy-focused destination with stricter transport economics—was not excluded. This led to an erroneous boost for 0103_03.
- **Cabin Deck Context Neglect:** The cabin deck (G, a non-luxury section) was not considered. Passengers in non-luxury cabins on destinations like TRAPPIST-1e may have higher transport eligibility thresholds, especially for children without clear accompanying adults.
- **Lack of CryoSleep Zero-Spending Risk Validation:** No rule penalized CryoSleep zero-spending passengers on certain destinations or cabin types where non-transport is common.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.3)

This update refines destination context, incorporates cabin deck validation, and adds a risk-check rule for CryoSleep zero-spending on specific destinations.

**Modify CryoSleep Contextual Override Rule (Step 0.a):**
- **CSO-1 ENHANCED v4 (DESTINATION-AGE-CABIN CONTEXT):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 18` AND `Destination in [55 Cancri e, PSO J318.5-22]` AND `Cabin_Deck in [A, B, C, D, E]` (luxury decks) → **Apply +8% confidence boost**.
  - IF `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 18` AND `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` AND `Cabin_Deck in [F, G, T]` (non-luxury decks) → **Apply -10% confidence penalty**.
  - **Rationale:** Children in CryoSleep on family destinations in luxury cabins are likely transported; those on economy destinations in non-luxury cabins may be higher risk for non-transport.

**Add CryoSleep Zero-Spending Risk Rule (New Step 0.j):**
- **CRYOSLEEP_ZERO_RISK_VALIDATION (CZR-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == True` AND all spending categories == 0.0 AND `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` AND `Cabin_Deck in [F, G, T]` AND `Age < 18` → **Apply -12% confidence penalty**.
  - **Rationale:** Explicitly penalize high-risk cases: young CryoSleep passengers with zero spending on economy destinations in non-luxury cabins.

**Adjust Pre-Screening for CryoSleep (Step 0.i):**
- **CRYOSLEEP_ZERO_SPENDING_VALIDATION (CZS-1 REVISED):**
  - Now routes to CZR-1 for risk validation before CSO-1 Enhanced v4.

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Destination Economics Matter:** TRAPPIST-1e has tighter transport economics—zero-spending CryoSleep passengers, especially children in non-luxury cabins, may be deemed non-essential.
- **Cabin Deck Indicates Socioeconomic Context:** Luxury decks (A-E) correlate with higher transport eligibility for CryoSleep passengers; non-luxury decks (F, G, T) require stricter checks.
- **Age and Destination Interact Non-Linearly:** Young age boosts eligibility on family destinations but reduces it on economy destinations without spending.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - CSO-1 Enhanced v4: Luxury destination/dec: +8% boost; Economy destination/deck: -10% penalty.
  - CZR-1: -12% penalty for high-risk CryoSleep zero-spending.
- **Adjusted Rules:**
  - ZDL-1: Maintained as CryoSleep-exempt.
- **Default Confidence:**
  - DF-1: Adjusted to **65% confidence** to account for higher uncertainty in economy cases.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add CZR-1 to pre-screening group for CryoSleep zero-spending.
- **Batch Destination-Cabin Validation:** Pre-batch, flag all CryoSleep=True passengers with Destination=TRAPPIST-1e and Cabin_Deck in [F, G, T] for CZR-1 processing.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor CryoSleep predictions on TRAPPIST-1e to validate new rules.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **CryoSleep with Zero Spending on TRAPPIST-1e in Non-Luxury Cabin:** Handled by CZR-1 and CSO-1 Enhanced v4 penalties.
- **CryoSleep with Non-Zero Spending:** Unchanged from v7.2.
- **Fallback:** If cabin deck is missing, use HomePlanet (Earth → higher risk for non-luxury) as proxy.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0103_03 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.3 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0103_03** (Earth, CryoSleep=True, Cabin=G/18/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=6.0, VIP=False, All Spending=0.0) | **NVA-1**: All spending=0.0 → **CZS-1**: Activated → **CZR-1**: Activated (Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Cabin_Deck=G, Age=6<18) → -12% penalty → **CSO-1 Enhanced v4**: Activated (Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Cabin_Deck=G) → -10% penalty → **PS-1** → **ACB-2**: Not triggered → **DF-1** | **False** | **43%** (PS-1: 65% + CZR-1: -12% + CSO-1 Enhanced v4: -10%) |

*The new rules correctly apply penalties for high-risk CryoSleep zero-spending, resulting in a False prediction.*

### Implementation Plan for v7.3

- **Deploy v7.3 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0103_03 is now False.
- **Monitor** all CryoSleep cases on TRAPPIST-1e with non-luxury cabins.
- **Update historical batches** with destination-cabin validation.
- **Long-term:** Integrate family group detection (e.g., shared surnames/cabins) to improve age-context accuracy.

This update ensures nuanced handling of CryoSleep passengers, balancing exemptions with destination- and cabin-based risk validation.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze the impact of travel group dynamics (e.g., siblings/parents in same cabin) on CryoSleep predictions.
