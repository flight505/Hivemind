PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 58
============================================================

### **CONTEXTUAL ERROR ANALYSIS & UPDATED METRICS v6.3 (MINOR CONTEXT EXPANSION UPDATE)**

**Objective:** To address the false negative error for Passenger 0082_03 by extending contextual awareness to minors without CryoSleep who exhibit zero-spend behavior. This update refines the ZDL-1 override conditions and adds new rules to better handle age-based spending patterns, ensuring higher accuracy for batch predictions involving children and adolescents.

---

#### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0082_03: What went wrong?**

The error for Passenger 0082_03 (Age=8.0, CryoSleep=False, all spend=0.0) resulted from an oversimplified application of the ZDL-1 rule without considering behavioral norms for minors. The model correctly detected the zero-spend anomaly but failed to account for the fact that children and young adolescents (Age < 13.0) often do not spend money independently, even when awake, due to dependency on accompanying adults. The ZDL-1 penalty was applied rigidly, leading to a false negative prediction (implied by "Predicted: None", which we interpret as a system error outputting no prediction or defaulting to False). This highlights a gap in the model's ability to handle age-related contextual nuances beyond cryosleep.

- **Key Failure Points:**
  - **Over-reliance on ZDL-1 for All Ages:** The ZDL-1 rule treated all zero-spend profiles equally, ignoring that minors (Age < 13.0) have a higher likelihood of zero spend due to parental supervision or lack of independent spending behavior.
  - **Incomplete Contextual Override:** The v6.2 override only applied to CryoSleep=True and Age<5.0, missing cases where CryoSleep=False but age indicates dependency.
  - **Prediction Output Issue:** The "Predicted: None" suggests a possible system error in handling cases where ZDL-1 dominates, indicating a need for better fallback mechanisms.

#### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v6.3)**

To prevent similar errors, the rules are updated with expanded contextual overrides and new age-based bonuses, ensuring that minors are not penalized for expected non-spending behavior.

- **Expand Contextual Override Pre-Check (Step 0):**
  - **NEW OVERRIDE CONDITION (MINOR-NO-SPEND):** IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age < 13.0` AND `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` → **BYPASS ZDL-1 PENALTY** with **85% confidence**. Process through standard pipeline.
  - **RETAIN OVERRIDE FOR CRYOCHILD:** IF `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 5.0` → Bypass ZDL-1 with **99% confidence**.
  - **Rationale:** This ensures that minors without cryosleep who do not spend are not falsely flagged as high-risk, while maintaining high confidence for biological constraints.

- **Modify ZDL-1 Rule (Step 1):**
  - **ZDL-1 (FURTHER REFINED):** If no override conditions are met, apply penalty: **Score = -10.0; Confidence = 90%; Final Prediction = False**. However, reduce confidence to 90% (from 95% in v6.1) to acknowledge contextual uncertainties.

- **Add New Rule for Awake Minors (Step 4 - Age & CryoSleep Rules):**
  - **AWAKE-MINOR-1 (NEW):** IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `Age < 13.0` → **Score = +0.3** (75% confidence).
  - **Rationale:** This rule provides a positive adjustment for minors who are awake, reflecting their higher likelihood of transport due to accompaniment by adults, even with low spending.

- **Enhance Default Rule for broader Age Range (Step 12):**
  - **DF-1 (MODIFIED):** Extend the positive adjustment to passengers with `Age < 13.0`. Score is now:
    - `+0.1` for `Age < 5.0` (as in v6.2)
    - `+0.05` for `5.0 ≤ Age < 13.0`
    - `-0.1` for `Age ≥ 13.0` (base default)
  - **Confidence:** Matches the base DF-1 confidence (typically 70-80%).
  - **Rationale:** This gradualed approach better captures the increased transport probability for younger passengers.

#### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**

- **Minor Dependency Behavior:** Passengers under 13, regardless of cryosleep status, often exhibit zero or low spending due to reliance on adults. This is not anomalous but normative, especially for destinations like TRAPPIST-1e, which may involve family migration.
- **Age as a Continuous Predictor:** The error underscores that age should be treated as a continuous variable with diminishing influence on spending behavior as age increases. Rules must be age-banded (e.g., <5, 5-12, 13+) for precision.
- **System Output Robustness:** The "Predicted: None" issue indicates a need for better error handling in the prediction pipeline to ensure all cases output a valid prediction (True/False) even when rules conflict or fail.

---

#### **4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels**

- **Contextual Override Confidence:** 
  - CryoChild override (CryoSleep=True & Age<5.0): **99% confidence** (unchanged, based on biological certainty).
  - Minor-No-Spend override (CryoSleep=False & Age<13.0 & zero spend): **85% confidence** (reflects behavioral likelihood but with some uncertainty).
- **ZDL-1 Confidence when Applied:** Reduced to **90%** (from 95% in v6.1) to account for edge cases.
- **New Rule Confidences:** 
  - AWAKE-MINOR-1: **75% confidence** (aligns with general minor behavior patterns).
  - DF-1 modifications: Use base DF-1 confidence levels.

#### **5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency**

- **Pre-Screening Flag (Enhanced):** The batch pre-screening now flags three groups:
  1. Passengers for ZDL-1 processing (`Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0`).
  2. Passengers for CryoChild override (`CryoSleep=True & Age < 5`).
  3. Passengers for Minor-No-Spend override (`CryoSleep=False & Age < 13.0 & Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0`).
- **Consistency Check:** Post-batch, audit all predictions for passengers with `Age < 13.0` and `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` to ensure predictions are not False without override. Flag discrepancies for manual review.
- **Error Logging:** Log all override triggers and ZDL-1 applications for continuous monitoring and model improvement.

---

#### **6. Handling Edge Cases**

- **Extended Contextual Framework:** The new override for awake minors ensures that edge cases involving children are handled gracefully without over-penalizing. This framework can be expanded to other dependencies (e.g., passengers with disabilities, group bookings).
- **Fallback Mechanism:** To address "Predicted: None" outputs, implement a default prediction of `True` with low confidence (e.g., 60%) if no rule fires or if conflicts arise, ensuring no missing predictions in batches.

### **New Scoring Example for Passenger 0082_03 (Corrected)**

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v6.3 Order) | Total Score | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0082_03** (F/16/P, Mars, **CryoSleep=False**, TRAPPIST-1e, **Age=8.0**, VIP=False, **All Spend=0.0**) | **CONTEXT OVERRIDE: Minor-No-Spend → BYPASS ZDL-1** → PS-2 (Not VIP) → **AWAKE-MINOR-1 (+0.3)** → ... → TRAPPIST-DEST-4 (may add minor penalty) → **DF-1 [MOD] (+0.05 for Age 5-12)** → ... | **~ +0.25 to +0.35** (Est., net positive after rules) | **True** | **~75%** (Est., based on rule confidences) |

*The expanded override prevents the ZDL-1 error, and the new AWAKE-MINOR-1 rule combined with DF-1 adjustment ensures a positive score, leading to a correct True prediction.*

### **Implementation Plan for v6.3**

- **Immediate Deployment:** Roll out v6.3 and reprocess the failed batch. Validate predictions for all passengers with `Age < 13.0` and zero spend.
- **Validation:** Re-run historical batches to identify similar cases and verify improved accuracy. Monitor override triggers and prediction outcomes.
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced logging for overrides and ZDL-1 applications. Set alerts for any "Predicted: None" outputs to investigate system errors.
- **Long-term:** Develop a machine learning sub-model focused on age-spend interactions to dynamically adjust rules based on empirical data, reducing reliance on heuristic thresholds.

This update significantly enhances the model's contextual reasoning for minors, reducing false negatives and improving batch prediction accuracy and consistency.
