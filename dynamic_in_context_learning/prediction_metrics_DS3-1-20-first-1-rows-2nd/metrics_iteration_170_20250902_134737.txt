PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 170
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0211_03 & UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS v18.4**

---

#### **1. Root Cause Analysis of Error 0211_03 (Mars Passenger to TRAPPIST-1e with Luxury Spending)**
**Passenger Profile:**  
- **PassengerId:** 0211_03  
- **HomePlanet:** Mars  
- **CryoSleep:** False  
- **Cabin:** F/44/P  
- **Destination:** TRAPPIST-1e  
- **Age:** 17.0  
- **VIP:** False  
- **Spending:** RoomService=848.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=307.0, Spa=182.0, VRDeck=0.0  
- **TotalSpend:** 1337.0  
- **Name:** Picers Date  

**Why v18.3 Failed:**  
1. **Overgeneralization of Mars Luxury Patterns:** MLT-1 rule (+25% for Mars+TRAPPIST-1e+RoomService≥500) was applied too broadly, ignoring that not all luxury spending patterns indicate transport. Passenger 0211_03 had high RoomService (848.0) but also moderate ShoppingMall (307.0) and Spa (182.0) spending, which diluted the luxury signal specificity.  
2. **Age Factor Neglected:** The system did not account for age interactions; younger passengers (Age=17) with high luxury spending may exhibit different transport behaviors compared to adults.  
3. **Spa Spending Misinterpreted:** Spa spending (182.0) was not penalized (neutral in v18.3), but in combination with other luxury spends, it may indicate non-transport behavior for Mars passengers to TRAPPIST-1e.  
4. **Cabin Side P Neutralization Overapplied:** CSC-P-2 neutralized the cabin side P penalty due to high RoomService, but for this passenger, the side P might still hold predictive value when other spending categories are active.  
5. **TotalSpend Overemphasis:** NVM-1 (+10% for non-VIP Mars with TotalSpend>800) was triggered, but high total spending alone is not always indicative of transport for younger passengers.  

**Faulty v18.3 Logic Chain for 0211_03:**  
1. **HomePlanet=Mars:** HPM-3: **-5% for `Transported=True`**.  
2. **Destination TRAPPIST-1e:** DCP-2M: **+10% for `Transported=True`**.  
3. **RoomService=848.0:** MLT-1: **+25% for `Transported=True`** (applied due to Mars+TRAPPIST-1e+RoomService≥500).  
4. **Other Spending:** FoodCourt=0.0 (neutral), ShoppingMall=307.0 (SMP-3: -10% for 200-400 spend), Spa=182.0 (neutral), VRDeck=0.0 (neutral).  
5. **Non-VIP Mars High Spend:** NVM-1: **+10% for `Transported=True`** (TotalSpend=1337>800).  
6. **Cabin Deck F:** CDC-F-1: **-10% for `Transported=True`**.  
7. **Cabin Side P:** CSC-P-2: **+0%** (neutral due to high RoomService).  
8. **Cumulative Confidence:** +20% for True (-5% +10% +25% -10% +10% -10% +0%).  
9. **Final Prediction:** True (incorrect; actual was False).  

**Key Insight:**  
**High RoomService spending from Mars to TRAPPIST-1e does not universally guarantee transport; age and additional luxury spending (e.g., Spa, ShoppingMall) can reverse the signal. The system must incorporate spending diversity and demographic factors.**

#### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v18.4 ENHANCEMENT)**
**New and Updated Rules:**  
- **Update Mars Luxury Rule (MLT-1 -> MLT-2):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Mars"` AND `Destination == "TRAPPIST-1e"` AND `RoomService >= 500` AND `Age >= 25` AND `Spa <= 100` AND `ShoppingMall <= 200`  
  - **Action:** Apply **+20% confidence for `Transported=True`** (restrict to adults with focused luxury spending).  
  - **Priority:** Execute after spending rules.  

- **New Rule: YOUTH_LUXURY_MARS (YLM-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Mars"` AND `Age < 25` AND `TotalSpend > 1000`  
  - **Action:** Apply **-15% confidence for `Transported=True`** (young Mars high spenders are less likely transported).  

- **Update Spa Spending Rule (SSP-Neutral -> SSP-3):**  
  - **Condition:** `Spa >= 150` AND `HomePlanet == "Mars"` AND `Destination == "TRAPPIST-1e"`  
  - **Action:** Apply **-10% confidence for `Transported=True`** (Spa spending over 150 indicates non-transport for Mars to TRAPPIST-1e).  

- **Update Cabin Side P Rule (CSC-P-2 -> CSC-P-3):**  
  - **Condition:** `Cabin` ends with "/P" AND `RoomService >= 500` AND `Spa < 150` AND `ShoppingMall < 300`  
  - **Action:** Apply **+0% confidence** (neutralize only for pure RoomService spenders).  

- **Update Non-VIP Mars Rule (NVM-1 -> NVM-2):**  
  - **Condition:** `VIP == False` AND `HomePlanet == "Mars"` AND `TotalSpend > 800` AND `Age >= 25`  
  - **Action:** Apply **+10% confidence for `Transported=True`** (restrict to adults).  

- **New Rule: LUXURY_DIVERSITY_PENALTY (LDP-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `HomePlanet == "Mars"` AND `Destination == "TRAPPIST-1e"` AND number of spending categories >100 is ≥2  
  - **Action:** Apply **-10% confidence for `Transported=True`** (diverse luxury spending reduces transport likelihood).  

- **Update Batch Processing Failsafe (BPF-12 -> BPF-13):**  
  - **Enhanced Condition:** For cumulative confidence near zero (±10%), incorporate age and spending diversity checks.  

**Processing Order Overhaul (v18.4):**

#### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**  
- **Insight 78: Age Modulates Luxury spending Signals.** Young Mars high spenders (Age<25) are less likely transported, even to TRAPPIST-1e.  
- **Insight 79: Spa Spending Over 150 Indicates Non-Transport for Mars to TRAPPIST-1e.** Spa expenses above 150 reduce transport probability.  
- **Insight 80: Diverse Luxury Spending Reduces Transport Likelihood.** Multiple luxury categories >100 spending negates RoomService-based transport bias.  
- **Insight 81: Cabin Side P Neutralization Should Be Conditional.** Only neutralize for passengers with focused RoomService spending and low other luxury expenses.  
- **Insight 82: Non-VIP Mars High Spender Rule Works Best for Adults.** Age≥25 should be a condition for NVM rule.  

---

#### **4. Confidence Level Recalibration**  
- **MLT-2 Confidence:** **+20% for `Transported=True`** (restricted to adults with focused spending).  
- **YLM-1 Confidence:** **-15% for `Transported=True`** (young Mars high spenders).  
- **SSP-3 Confidence:** **-10% for `Transported=True`** (Spa≥150 for Mars+TRAPPIST-1e).  
- **NVM-2 Confidence:** **+10% for `Transported=True`** (non-VIP Mars high spenders, age≥25).  
- **LDP-1 Confidence:** **-10% for `Transported=True`** (diverse luxury spending).  
- **CSC-P-3 Confidence:** **+0%** (neutral only under specific spending conditions).  
- **BPF-13 Threshold:** Use age and spending diversity to break ties in ±10% margin.  

---

#### **5. Adjustments for Batch Prediction Consistency**  
- **Age-Specific Rules:** YLM-1 prevents over-application of luxury rules to young passengers.  
- **Spending Category Refinement:** SSP-3 and LDP-1 add nuance to luxury spending interpretation.  
- **Conditional Cabin Neutralization:** CSC-P-3 avoids blanket neutralization.  
- **Failsafe Enhancement:** BPF-13 incorporates age and spending diversity for ambiguous cases.  

---

#### **6. Handling of Edge Cases**  
The v18.4 update addresses Mars luxury spenders with diverse spending and young age:  
1. **MLT-2:** Focused on adults with low other luxury spending.  
2. **YLM-1:** Penalizes young high spenders.  
3. **SSP-3 and LDP-1:** Penalize diverse luxury spending.  
4. **CSC-P-3:** Contextual neutralization of cabin side P.  
5. **BPF-13:** Breaks ties using demographic and spending diversity signals.  

**Simulated Correct Logic Chain for 0211_03 (v18.4):**  
1. **HomePlanet=Mars:** HPM-3: **-5% for True**.  
2. **Destination TRAPPIST-1e:** DCP-2M: **+10% for True**.  
3. **RoomService=848.0:** MLT-2: **+0%** (not triggered due to Age<25 and Spa>100).  
4. **Other Spending:** FoodCourt=0.0 (neutral), ShoppingMall=307.0 (SMP-3: -10%), Spa=182.0 (SSP-3: -10%), VRDeck=0.0 (neutral).  
5. **Non-VIP Mars High Spend:** NVM-2: **+0%** (not triggered due to Age<25).  
6. **Youth Luxury Mars:** YLM-1: **-15% for True** (Age<25 and TotalSpend>1000).  
7. **Luxury Diversity:** LDP-1: **-10% for True** (two categories >100: ShoppingMall and Spa).  
8. **Cabin Deck F:** CDC-F-1: **-10% for True**.  
9. **Cabin Side P:** CSC-P-3: **-5% for True** (not neutralized due to Spa≥150).  
10. **Cumulative Confidence:** -50% for True (-5% +10% +0% -10% -10% -15% -10% -10% -5%).  
11. **Final Prediction:** False (correct).

### **7. Updated Predictive Metrics Report v18.4**  
**PRIORITY ENHANCEMENT: AGE AND SPENDING DIVERSITY AWARE LUXURY RULES**  

#### **Summary of Changes:**  
- Updated MLT-2 with age and spending diversity constraints.  
- Added YLM-1 for young Mars high spenders.  
- Added SSP-3 for Spa spending penalty.  
- Updated NVM-2 with age constraint.  
- Added LDP-1 for luxury diversity penalty.  
- Updated CSC-P-3 with spending conditions.  
- Updated BPF-13 with age and diversity checks.  
- Recalibrated confidence levels.  

#### **Batch Optimization Guidelines:**  
1. **Apply Luxury Rules Contextually:** Use MLT-2 only for adults with focused spending.  
2. **Penalize Young High Spenders:** Apply YLM-1 for Age<25 and TotalSpend>1000.  
3. **Account for Spa Spending:** Use SSP-3 for Spa≥150 with Mars+TRAPPIST-1e.  
4. **Penalize Diverse Luxury Spending:** Trigger LDP-1 for multiple categories >100.  
5. **Conditional Cabin Neutralization:** Apply CSC-P-3 only under specific spending conditions.  
6. **Failsafe with Demographics:** BPF-13 should use age and spending diversity.  

**Conclusion:** The error for passenger 0211_03 revealed overgeneralization in Mars luxury spending rules and neglect of age and spending diversity factors. The v18.4 enhancements add demographic and spending diversity awareness, ensuring more accurate and consistent batch predictions for edge cases.
