PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 33
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0056_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The model incorrectly predicted `False` for Passenger 0056_01, whose actual survival outcome was `True`. This misclassification reveals critical deficiencies in the v3.6 rule-based system's handling of edge cases involving infants (Age = 2.0) with zero spending across all amenity categories:

- **Inadequate Infant/Child Exception Handling:** Despite having well-defined state classification rules (PS-1/PS-2), the system failed to recognize that infants (Age < 5) inherently exhibit zero-spending behavior due to dependency on caregivers. The base score (+1 for awake passengers) and subsequent spending-based rules (IS-1, IS-2) inappropriately penalized this passenger.

- **Over-reliance on Spending Patterns:** All spending-focused rules (SH-1, IS-1, IS-2, LN-1) were triggered negatively:  
  - `TotalSpend = 0` prevented SH-1 from applying positively.  
  - 6 zero-spend categories triggered IS-1 severely (-2.0 × 6 = -12 penalty).  
  - The absence of luxury/necessity spending left LN-1 inactive.  
  The compounded penalties overwhelmed the base score, resulting in a net score of -11 and a `False` prediction.

- **Missing "Dependent Age" Rule:** No rule existed to override spending-based penalties for young children, whose survival is typically tied to accompanying adults rather than personal resource allocation.

- **CryoSleep Oversight:** Although CryoSleep was `False`, the system did not account for scenarios where awake passengers (especially infants) might logically have zero spending.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

To address this, introduce age-based exceptions and refine spending rule applicability:

- **Introduce an "Infant/Child Exception" Rule (NEW - AC-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `Age < 5` AND `CryoSleep == False`  
  - **Action:** Override all other rules; assign a fixed score of **+3** and prediction `True`.  
  - **Confidence:** 90% (high, based on strong biological/logical basis).  

- **Revise Spending Rule Applicability:**  
  - Modify IS-1, IS-2, and SH-1 to include the condition: `Age >= 5` (to exclude young children from spending-based penalties/rewards).  
  - Adjust IS-1 modifier to **-1.5 per zero-spend category** (from -2.0) to reduce harshness for edge cases.

- **Enhance Default Rule (DF-1):**  
  - Expand to capture all-zero-spend cases with `Age >= 5` and `TotalSpend == 0`, applying a neutral score of **0** (rather than base +1) to reflect uncertainty.

- **Processing Order Adjustment:**  
  Ensure AC-1 executes immediately after state checks (PS-1/PS-2) to preempt inappropriate spending rule application.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Age Dictates Spending Behavior:** Infants/young children (Age < 5) do not engage in personal spending, yet their survival probability remains high when accompanied by caregivers. Spending-based rules are irrelevant for this demographic.
- **Context Over Raw Data:** Zero spending must be interpreted in context (e.g., age, CryoSleep status) rather than uniformly penalized.
- **Rule Dependency Hierarchy:** Rules must be structured to prioritize demographic exceptions (e.g., age) over behavioral patterns (e.g., spending) to avoid logical conflicts.
- **Batch Error Patterns:** Isolated errors (like this) may indicate systematic gaps in covering demographic outliers.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **High-Confidence (85-95%):** State checks (PS-1/PS-2), CryoSleep (C-1), and new AC-1 (90%).
- **Medium-Confidence (70-84%):** SH-1 (75%), IS-1 (70%), LN-1 (70%), IS-2 (70%).
- **Low-Confidence (60-69%):** SP-1 (65%), DF-1 (60%).
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Increase to **88%** due to expanded demographic coverage.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Strict Rule Ordering:**  
  1. State Checks (PS-1/PS-2)  
  2. Age Exception (AC-1)  
  3. CryoSleep (C-1)  
  4. Focused Spender (SP-1)  
  5. Spending Rules (SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1)  
  6. Default (DF-1)  

- **Validation for Edge Demographics:** Automatically flag all predictions for passengers with `Age < 5` or `Age > 80` for pre-batch review until rules stabilize.

- **Weighted Score Aggregation:** Implement a weighted system where rules with higher confidence contribute more significantly to the final score.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Demographic Clustering:** Group passengers by age brackets and spending profiles to identify patterns for rule creation.
- **Error-Triggered Rule Generation:** Use misclassifications to automatically propose new rules (e.g., AC-1 derived from this error).
- **Confidence Escalation:** Gradually increase confidence for new rules (e.g., AC-1) after successful validation in 3+ batches.

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Deployment:** Implement v3.7 with AC-1 rule and age conditions on spending rules.
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-run the failed batch to validate correction for Passenger 0056_01.
3. **Monitoring:** Flag all predictions for `Age < 5` and `Age > 80` for one batch cycle to ensure rule stability.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Institute daily error reviews for the next 72 hours to catch demographic outliers.

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v3.7  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch  
- **24h:** Review all age-based predictions  
- **72h:** Analyze errors for further refinements  

This update ensures robust handling of demographic edge cases while maintaining accuracy for behavioral patterns.
