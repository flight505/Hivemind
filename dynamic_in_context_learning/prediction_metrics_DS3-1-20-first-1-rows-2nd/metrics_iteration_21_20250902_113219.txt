PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 21
============================================================

### **Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0039_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The model incorrectly predicted survival for Passenger 0039_01 due to a critical misinterpretation of NaN values in the context of CryoSleep:

- **Misapplication of CryoSleep Override:** The model applied Rule C-1 (+2 modifier) based solely on `CryoSleep == True`, without properly accounting for the implications of NaN values in spending categories for CryoSleep passengers.

- **Failure to Distinguish Between Zero and NaN:** The current system treats explicit zeros ($0.0) and NaN values identically in spending pattern analysis, leading to incorrect classification. For CryoSleep passengers, NaN should represent unavailable data (passenger wasn't using amenities), not zero spending.

- **Overreliance on Base Score:** The base score (+1) was applied despite ambiguous spending data, compounding the error from the CryoSleep override.

- **Missing NaN Handling Logic:** No specific rules exist to handle cases where CryoSleep passengers have NaN values in amenity categories, which should be treated differently than explicit zeros.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
- **Revise CryoSleep Rule (C-1):** Update to: "IF `CryoSleep == True` AND all amenity values are either NaN or 0, apply +2 modifier"
- **Add NaN Validation Rule (NV-1):** Create new rule: "IF any amenity is NaN AND `Cryleep == False`, apply -1 scrutiny modifier due to data quality concerns"
- **Modify Base Score Application:** Base score should only apply when spending pattern is clearly interpretable (no ambiguous NaN values in key categories)
- **Implement Data Quality Check:** Add pre-processing rule to flag passengers with mixed data types (NaN + numerical values) for special handling

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
- **NaN Values Have Contextual Meaning:** For CryoSleep passengers, NaN values likely indicate "not applicable" rather than "zero spending," requiring different interpretation
- **Data Quality Impacts Prediction Accuracy:** Mixed data patterns (NaN + numerical values) in CryoSleep passengers indicate potential data collection issues that affect prediction reliability
- **CryoSleep Override Needs Qualification:** The CryoSleep survival advantage assumption requires validation against data quality and spending pattern consistency
- **Batch Processing Must Account for Data Integrity:** Prediction systems need robust data validation before applying substantive rules

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
- **CryoSleep Rule (C-1) Confidence:** Reduce to 85% when NaN values are present
- **New NaN Validation Rule (NV-1) Confidence:** 75% for data quality flags
- **Base Score Confidence:** Reduce to 60% when ambiguous data patterns exist
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Adjust to 87% with improved NaN handling

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
- **Implement Data Quality Pre-screening:** Add batch processing step to classify data integrity before prediction
- **Create Separate NaN Handling Rules:** Different rules for CryoSleep vs awake passengers with NaN values
- **Add Validation Checks:** Ensure spending data consistency (either all NaN/zero for CryoSleep, or all numerical for awake)
- **Batch Processing Order:** Process passengers with data quality issues (mixed NaN/numerical) last for manual review

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
- **Develop Data Integrity Index** measuring consistency of data types across amenity categories
- **Add context-specific NaN interpretation rules** based on passenger status (CryoSleep, VIP, etc.)
- **Implement two-stage prediction:** Data quality assessment followed by substantive prediction
- **Create exception handling protocol** for passengers with ambiguous data patterns
