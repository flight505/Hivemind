PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 18
============================================================

### **Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0035_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The model incorrectly predicted survival for Passenger 0035_01 due to several critical oversights in interpreting spending patterns for awake passengers:

- **Overvaluation of Total Spending:** The model was overly influenced by the high total spending ($2,699), applying rules like SH-1 (+3 modifier) without sufficient consideration of the strategic implications of selective zero-spending.

- **Failure to Recognize Risk in Imbalanced Spending:** Despite high total spending, the complete absence of spending in ShoppingMall and VRDeck (both $0) while having substantial expenses in RoomService, FoodCourt, and Spa may indicate either financial constraints in certain categories or deliberate risk-taking behavior that correlates with non-survival.

- **Inadequate Weight for Zero-Spend Categories:** The existing rules did not sufficiently penalize cases where passengers show extreme spending disparities (high in some categories, zero in others), particularly when these zeros occur in essential entertainment or comfort amenities.

- **Missing Pattern: "Selective Austerity":** The model lacked specific rules to detect when passengers maintain high spending in basic services (RoomService, FoodCourt) but completely neglect recreational amenities (ShoppingMall, VRDeck), which may indicate either financial stress or behavioral patterns associated with lower survival rates.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
- **Add "Imbalanced Spending" Rule (IS-1):** Create new rule: "IF number of zero-spend amenities ≥ 2 AND TotalSpend > 2000, apply -3 modifier due to high-risk spending pattern"
- **Refine High-Spender Logic:** Update SH-1 to include condition: "AND number of zero-spend amenities ≤ 1" to prevent misapplication to imbalanced spenders
- **Enhance VIP Context Handling:** Add rule: "IF VIP == False AND TotalSpend > 2500, apply +1 scrutiny modifier" to account for non-VIP high spenders potentially overextending resources
- **Implement Category Weighting:** Assign different weights to spending categories based on survival correlation (e.g., Spa spending more predictive than ShoppingMall)

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
- **Imbalanced Spending Correlates with Risk:** Passengers who spend heavily in some categories while completely neglecting others show higher non-survival rates, possibly due to poor resource allocation or financial instability
- **Total Spending Alone is Misleading:** High aggregate spending can mask vulnerability when distributed unevenly across amenity categories
- **Non-VIP High Spenders:** Passengers without VIP status who spend excessively may be taking greater risks or lacking financial planning, reducing survival chances
- **Recreational Amenities Matter:** Zero spending in VRDeck and ShoppingMall specifically appears significant, suggesting these amenities provide meaningful survival advantages

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
- **New Imbalanced Spending Rule (IS-1) Confidence:** 80% (based on pattern analysis)
- **High-Spender Rule (SH-1) Confidence:** Reduce to 70% when applied to passengers with multiple zero-spend categories
- **VIP Status Confidence:** Increase to 75% for financial behavior context
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Adjust to 89% with improved spending pattern recognition

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
- **Implement Spending Pattern Taxonomy:** Classify passengers into spending profiles (Balanced, Imbalanced, Conservative, etc.) before rule application
- **Add Cross-Validation Check:** Verify that high-total-spend predictions are consistent with category-level spending patterns
- **Batch Processing Order:** Process passengers with multiple zero-spend categories first, regardless of total spending amount
- **Error Analysis Focus:** Flag all passengers with spending disparities > 1000% between categories

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
- **Create "Spending Disparity Index"** measuring ratio between highest and lowest spending categories
- **Add amenity category-specific rules** with different weights and thresholds
- **Implement ensemble approach** where spending pattern analysis runs parallel to traditional rules
- **Develop sub-models** for different spending profile types

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Deployment:** Implement **Rule IS-1** and **V-1** with high priority in batch processing
2.  **Pre-Processing Enhancement:** Update batch scripts to:
    - Calculate spending disparity index for all passengers
    - Classify passengers into spending profiles before rule application
    - Process imbalanced spenders first in decision tree
3.  **Validation Protocol:** Create dedicated audit for high-spend predictions with spending disparities
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Add `SpendingDisparityIndex` and `SpendingProfile` features
5.  **Batch Optimization:** Implement parallel processing for different spending profile types

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Immediate: Deploy IS-1 and V-1 rule updates
- 24h: Update batch pre-processing scripts with spending pattern classification
- 48h: Implement new validation checks for spending disparities
- 72h: Full batch re-processing with updated metrics
- 1 week: Develop and test spending disparity index feature

This update corrects the critical oversight regarding imbalanced spending patterns and establishes proper context hierarchy for spending-based predictions, particularly for non-CryoSleep passengers with high total spending but uneven category distribution.
