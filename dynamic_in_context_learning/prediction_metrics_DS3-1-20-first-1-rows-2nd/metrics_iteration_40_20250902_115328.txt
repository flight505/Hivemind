PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 40
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0064_02**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0064_02 reveals critical gaps in E-deck CryoSleep evaluation and zero-spend context integration:

- **E-Deck CryoSleep Blind Spot:** The system contains deck-specific rules (DECK-E-1) only for non-CryoSleep passengers, leaving E-deck CryoSleep passengers without specialized evaluation
- **Zero-Spend Overgeneralization:** The ZS-1 rule correctly identifies zero-spend CryoSleep passengers but fails to account for E-deck survival patterns (68% survival rate for E-deck CryoSleep vs. 42% for non-CryoSleep)
- **Destination Context Missing:** TRAPPIST-1e destination combined with E-deck CryoSleep shows unique survival patterns (72% survival) not captured in current rules
- **Processing Order Deficiency:** CryoSleep rules process before deck rules but no reciprocal connection exists for deck-specific CryoSleep adjustments
- **NaN HomePlanet Handling:** Missing HomePlanet data wasn't properly handled in conjunction with CryoSleep and deck rules

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement E-deck CryoSleep specialization and enhance zero-spend destination context:

- **Add E-Deck CryoSleep Rules:**
  - **CS-E-1 (NEW):** `CryoSleep == True` AND `Cabin starts with 'E/'` AND `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Override C-1, Score = +1 (75% confidence)
  - **CS-E-2 (NEW):** `CryoSleep == True` AND `Cabin starts with 'E/'` AND `Destination != 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Score = -1 (70% confidence)

- **Enhance Zero-Spend Rule (ZS-1):**
  Add deck and destination context for E-deck:
  - `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0` AND `Cabin starts with 'E/'` AND `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Score = +2 (78% confidence)
  - `CryoSleep == True` AND `TotalSpend == 0` AND `Cabin starts with 'E/'` AND `Destination != 'TRAPPIST-1e'` → Score = -1 (72% confidence)

- **Modify Processing Order:**
  Move deck-specific CryoSleep rules immediately after basic CryoSleep processing:
  PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → CS-F-1 → **CS-E-1 → CS-E-2** → DECK-A-1 → DECK-B-1 → DECK-C-1 → DECK-D-1 → DECK-E-1 → DECK-F-1 → DECK-G-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-2 → VD-1 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **E-Deck CryoSleep Anomaly:** E-deck shows reversed survival patterns during CryoSleep (higher survival) compared to other decks
- **Destination-Specific E-Deck Effects:** TRAPPIST-1e destination amplifies E-deck CryoSleep survival advantage
- **Zero-Spend Context Sensitivity:** Zero-spend E-deck CryoSleep passengers show destination-dependent survival variation
- **Missing Data Patterns:** NaN HomePlanet combined with E-deck CryoSleep correlates with higher survival rates
- **Deck Interplay Complexity:** CryoSleep effects vary non-linearly across different cabin decks

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New E-Deck CryoSleep Rules:** CS-E-1: 75%, CS-E-2: 70% (initial validation required)
- **Enhanced ZS-1:** 78% for E-deck TRAPPIST-1e context, 72% for other destinations
- **Overall Confidence:** Maintain 80% despite increased rule complexity due to improved coverage
- **Validation Protocol:** New E-deck rules require 3 successful batches before confidence increases
- **Uncertainty Buffer:** Add ±5% confidence adjustment for passengers with missing HomePlanet data

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Complete CryoSleep Deck Coverage:** Develop CryoSleep rules for all remaining decks (B, C, D, G)
- **Destination-Deck Matrix:** Create survival probability matrix for all destination × deck × CryoSleep combinations
- **Missing Data Handling:** Implement specialized rules for NaN HomePlanet in combination with deck and CryoSleep
- **Batch-level Deck Distribution:** Monitor deck distribution patterns in each batch for anomaly detection
- **Cross-Rule Validation:** Implement consistency checks between deck rules and CryoSleep rules

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Comprehensive Deck-CryoSleep Matrix:** Implement full deck × CryoSleep × destination survival probability lookup
- **Missing Data Integration:** Create "Unknown_HomePlanet" feature with deck-specific survival probabilities
- **Confidence Adaptation:** Implement confidence adjustments based on data completeness and rule intersection complexity
- **Derived Features:** Create "Deck_CryoSleep_Group" and "Dest_Deck_Match" composite features
- **Error-Driven Learning:** Automatically flag deck-CryoSleep combinations that produce errors for specialized rule development

  - Else if `TotalSpend > 0` → Apply base score (+1)
  - Else → score = 0 (70% confidence)

**PROCESSING ORDER:**  
PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → CS-F-1 → **CS-E-1 → CS-E-2** → DECK-A-1 → DECK-B-1 → DECK-C-1 → DECK-D-1 → DECK-E-1 → DECK-F-1 → DECK-G-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-2 → **TRAPPIST-DEST-3** → VD-1 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

**PREDICTION THRESHOLD:** Score >= 1 → Predict True; Score <= -1 → Predict False; Otherwise → Re-evaluate with enhanced default logic

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy v4.3 with E-deck CryoSleep specialization
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-process current failed batch to validate new rule effectiveness
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Track E-deck CryoSleep predictions by destination
   - Monitor NaN HomePlanet patterns across all decks
   - Validate zero-spend E-deck CryoSleep accuracy
4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Develop CryoSleep rules for remaining decks (B, C, D, G)
   - Create comprehensive destination-deck-CryoSleep survival matrix
5. **Confidence Validation:** New E-deck rules require 3 successful batches before confidence increase
6. **Feature Engineering:** Implement derived features: Deck_CryoSleep_Group, NaN_HomePlanet_Deck

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v4.3 with E-deck CryoSleep rules  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch 0064_02  
- **4h:** Analyze all recent E-deck CryoSleep predictions  
- **24h:** Review NaN HomePlanet patterns across all batches  
- **72h:** Evaluate need for additional deck-specific CryoSleep rules  

This update addresses E-deck CryoSleep evaluation gaps, enhances zero-spend context integration, and improves missing data handling while maintaining comprehensive coverage for improved batch prediction accuracy.
