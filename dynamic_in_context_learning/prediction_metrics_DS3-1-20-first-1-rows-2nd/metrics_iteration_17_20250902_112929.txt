PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 17
============================================================

### **Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0034_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The model incorrectly predicted non-survival for Passenger 0034_01 due to a critical oversight in the interaction between CryoSleep status and spending patterns:

- **Failure to Account for CryoSleep Context:** The model applied zero-spend penalties (Rule S-3) despite `CryoSleep: True`, which biologically prevents spending. All zero values here are expected and should not be penalized.

- **Over-Reliance on Spending Data Alone:** Rules like S-3 and A-4 were triggered based purely on numerical values without considering the passenger's metabolic state. The system treated this as a "low-spend" case rather than a "frozen passenger" case.

- **Insufficient Weight for CryoSleep Survival Bias:** Existing rules did not adequately capture the strong correlation between CryoSleep and survival (due to reduced resource consumption and protected state during incidents).

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
- **Add CryoSleep Override Rule:** Create a new rule (C-1): "IF CryoSleep == True, ALL spending-based penalties are nullified, and apply +2 modifier for survival bias."
- **Refine Zero-Spend Logic:** Update S-3 to include condition: "IF CryoSleep == False AND [conditions]" to prevent misapplication.
- **Enhance Pre-Processing:** Implement metadata flagging for CryoSleep passengers before spending rules are applied.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
- **CryoSleep Dominates Spending Signals:** When passengers are frozen, spending data becomes irrelevant for survival prediction.
- **Resource Conservation Advantage:** CryoSleep passengers inherently have higher survival rates due to reduced vulnerability during crises.
- **Metadata Over Raw Values:** Operational status (CryoSleep) can override behavioral data (spending) in predictive importance.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
- **New CryoSleep Rule (C-1) Confidence:** 95% (high confidence due to biological constraints)
- **Zero-Spend Rule (S-3) Confidence:** Reduce to 40% when applied without CryoSleep check
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Increase to 91% with better context handling

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
- **Pre-Processing Priority:** Evaluate CryoSleep status before any spending-related rules
- **Batch Validation:** Add checkpoint to verify CryoSleep exceptions are applied consistently
- **Error Analysis Focus:** Flag all CryoSleep passengers in prediction audits

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
- **Add "CryoSleep Context" feature category** with specialized rules
- **Implement rule dependency tagging** to prevent conflicting logic
- **Create sub-models** for CryoSleep vs. awake passengers

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Deployment:** Implement **Rule C-1** with highest priority in batch processing
2.  **Pre-Processing Enhancement:** Update batch scripts to:
    - Sort passengers by CryoSleep status first
    - Apply C-1 before any spending evaluation
3.  **Validation Protocol:** Create dedicated audit for CryoSleep predictions
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Add `IsCryoSleep` binary feature with rule dependency tags
5.  **Batch Optimization:** Process CryoSleep passengers through simplified decision tree

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Immediate: Deploy C-1 rule update
- 24h: Update batch pre-processing scripts
- 48h: Implement new validation checks
- 72h: Full batch re-processing with updated metrics

This update corrects the critical oversight regarding CryoSleep passengers and establishes proper context hierarchy for future predictions.
