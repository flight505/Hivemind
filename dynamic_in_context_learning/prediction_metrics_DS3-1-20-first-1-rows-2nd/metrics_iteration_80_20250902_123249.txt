PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 80
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.4 (HIGH ROOMSERVICE, ZERO LUXURY SPENDING GAP HANDLING)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0107_01 by addressing a significant oversight in non-CryoSleep passenger handling: the failure to incorporate context where high RoomService spending coexists with zero luxury spending (Spa, VRDeck) on economy-class destinations like TRAPPIST-1e. The passenger had substantial RoomService charges (1743.0) but zero spending in Spa and VRDeck, indicating possible essential-only consumption inconsistent with Transport eligibility on a budget-conscious route. This highlights that high basic spending without luxury expenses may signal non-transport candidacy, necessitating a luxury spending gap validation rule.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0107_01: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0107_01 (Age=21.0, CryoSleep=False, RoomService=1743.0, FoodCourt=5.0, ShoppingMall=17.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=0.0, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, HomePlanet=Mars, VIP=False, Cabin=D/2/S) resulted from overreliance on aggregate spending without contextual luxury gap analysis:

**Key Failure Points:**
- **Luxury Spending Gap Neglect:** The model applied standard spending overrides (e.g., AS-1 Revised, MDS-1) which boosted confidence due to high RoomService, but did not account for the complete absence of luxury expenditures (Spa=0, VRDeck=0). On TRAPPIST-1e—an economy-focused destination—such a pattern may indicate essential-only consumption, common in non-transported individuals.
- **Destination Context Oversight:** TRAPPIST-1e's transport economics favor passengers with balanced or luxury-inclined spending; those with skewed essential spending (like high RoomService alone) are higher risk for non-transport.
- **Cabin and Age Context Not Fully Leveraged:** Cabin deck D (mid-tier) and adult age (21) did not trigger sufficient risk checks, as existing rules prioritized CryoSleep and youth contexts.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.4)

This update introduces a new rule to validate luxury spending gaps for non-CryoSleep passengers on specific destinations and refines existing spending rules.

**Add Luxury Spending Gap Validation Rule (New Step 0.k):**
- **LUXURY_SPENDING_GAP_VALIDATION (LSG-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `RoomService > 1500` AND `Spa == 0.0` AND `VRDeck == 0.0` AND `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` → **Apply -15% confidence penalty**.
  - **Rationale:** High RoomService with zero luxury spending on economy destinations indicates essential-only consumption, reducing transport likelihood.

**Modify Aggregate Spending Override Rule (Step 0.c):**
- **AS-1 REVISED v2:**
  - Now includes a check for luxury spending gap: if conditions for LSG-1 are met, skip boosting and route to LSG-1 instead of applying +X% boost.
  - **Rationale:** Prevent over-boosting for cases with imbalanced spending patterns.

**Adjust Contextual Spending Pattern Rule (Step 2.5):**
- **CSP-1 ENHANCED v2:**
  - Incorporate luxury gap check: for non-CryoSleep passengers on TRAPPIST-1e, if RoomService > 1500 and Spa=0 and VRDeck=0, reduce confidence by 10% inline.
  - **Rationale:** Add secondary validation layer for spending pattern risks.

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Luxury Spending Discrepancies Matter:** High basic spending (e.g., RoomService) without luxury expenses (Spa, VRDeck) on economy destinations like TRAPPIST-1e often correlates with non-transport, as it suggests budget constraints or non-recreational travel purposes.
- **Destination-Spending Interaction:** TRAPPIST-1e's transport thresholds are sensitive to spending balance; luxury absence negates high basic spending benefits.
- **Non-CryoSleep Adults Require Granular Checks:** Adults without CryoSleep need spending pattern validation beyond aggregates, especially on economy routes.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - LSG-1: -15% penalty for luxury spending gap.
  - CSP-1 Enhanced v2: -10% penalty for gap cases.
- **Adjusted Rules:**
  - AS-1 Revised v2: Bypass boost for gap cases.
- **Default Confidence:**
  - DF-1: Further adjusted to **63% confidence** to account for luxury gap risks.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add LSG-1 to pre-screening for non-CryoSleep passengers with RoomService > 1500 and Destination=TRAPPIST-1e.
- **Batch Luxury Gap Validation:** Pre-batch, flag all non-CryoSleep passengers with high RoomService and zero Spa/VRDeck on TRAPPIST-1e for LSG-1 processing.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor non-CryoSleep predictions on TRAPPIST-1e with spending imbalances to validate new rules.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **High RoomService, Zero Luxury on TRAPPIST-1e:** Handled by LSG-1 and CSP-1 Enhanced v2 penalties.
- **CryoSleep Cases:** Unchanged from v7.3; luxury gap not applicable due to CryoSleep spending exemptions.
- **Fallback:** If luxury spending data is missing, use spending ratio (RoomService vs. total) as proxy for gap detection.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0107_01 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.4 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0107_01** (Mars, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=D/2/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=21.0, VIP=False, RoomService=1743.0, FoodCourt=5.0, ShoppingMall=17.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=0.0) | **NVA-1**: Spending present → **AS-1 Revised v2**: RoomService high, but luxury gap detected → route to **LSG-1**: Activated (Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, RoomService>1500, Spa=0, VRDeck=0) → -15% penalty → **PS-1** → **CSP-1 Enhanced v2**: Activated (luxury gap) → -10% penalty → **ACB-2**: Not triggered → **DF-1** | **False** | **38%** (PS-1: 63% + LSG-1: -15% + CSP-1 Enhanced v2: -10%) |

*The new rules correctly penalize the luxury spending gap, resulting in a False prediction.*

### Implementation Plan for v7.4

- **Deploy v7.4 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0107_01 is now False.
- **Monitor** all non-CryoSleep cases on TRAPPIST-1e with high RoomService and zero luxury spending.
- **Update historical batches** with luxury gap validation.
- **Long-term:** Integrate spending ratio analytics (e.g., RoomService/(Spa+VRDeck)) for finer-grained gap detection.

This update ensures nuanced handling of spending pattern discrepancies, preventing over-boosting for imbalanced cases on economy destinations.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze the impact of VIP status on luxury spending patterns for non-CryoSleep passengers.
