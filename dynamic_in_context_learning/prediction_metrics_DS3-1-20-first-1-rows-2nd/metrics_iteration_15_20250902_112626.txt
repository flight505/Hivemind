PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 15
============================================================

### **Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0031_02**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The model incorrectly predicted non-survival for Passenger 0031_02 due to a critical oversight in applying age-contextual spending interpretation. The passenger is a 2-year-old child from Mars with zero spending across all amenities while not in CryoSleep. The current rule system failed to account for:

- **Age-Driven Spending Behavior:** The rules (including the recently added SH-1 and M-2) are calibrated for adults and adolescents, not infants/toddlers. A 2-year-old logically has no independent spending capability, making all zero values expected rather than anomalous. The model treated these zeros as negative evidence (potentially triggering low-spend or zero-spend rules negatively) without the contextual understanding that for very young children, zero spending is normative and not indicative of survival chances.

- **Over-reliance on Absolute Zero Patterns:** Rule S-3 and similar zero-spend interpretative frameworks do not incorporate age brackets. The system lacked a dedicated rule to identify passengers under a certain age threshold (e.g., <5 years) for whom amenity spending is inherently absent or minimal, and for whom survival is often tied to accompanying adults or default transport protocols rather than personal resource allocation.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
Introduce age-dimensional analysis to prevent misapplication of spending-based rules to demographics for whom they are irrelevant.

- **Create an "Infant/Child Passenger" Rule (New Rule C-1):** Establish a rule that identifies passengers below a certain age (e.g., Age < 5) and applies a positive survival modifier based on standard transport protocols for minors.
- **Modify Zero-Spend Rules with Age Conditionals:** Amend rules like S-3 to include an exception clause: e.g., "IF Age >= 5 THEN [apply zero-spend logic]" to prevent incorrect penalization of young children.
- **Enhance Martian Rule Specificity:** Update Mars-specific rules to account for age distribution, recognizing that Martian families might have different travel configurations.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
- **Age is a Primary Behavioral Moderator:** Spending behavior is not independently predictive without age context. The same spending pattern (e.g., all zeros) has opposite implications for an adult versus a young child.
- **Default Survival Mechanisms for Dependents:** There appear to be underlying protocols (e.g., automatic placement with guardians, prioritized safety measures) for young passengers that override individual resource-based survival factors.
- **Planetary Cultural Norms in Family Travel:** Mars-origin passengers might have distinct family travel behaviors that need to be modeled with age-group specificity.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
- **High Confidence for New Child Rule (C-1):** Introduce with **90% confidence** given the clear logical basis and error correction impetus.
- **Reduce Confidence in Generic Zero-Spend Rules:** Lower confidence in Rule S-3 to **50%** unless accompanied by age validation.
- **Adjust Model-Wide Confidence:** With better demographic handling, target batch accuracy can be maintained at **89%** with improved consistency.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
- **Age Pre-Processing:** Implement age-band tagging (e.g., "Infant: 0-4", "Child: 5-12") during batch pre-processing to route passengers to appropriate rule sets.
- **Rule Application Hierarchy:** Prioritize age-specific rules over general spending rules when age conditions are met.
- **Cross-Validation with Family Groups:** For young passengers, attempt to link with accompanying adults in the same cabin or group and apply group-based survival prediction if patterns are consistent.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
- **Expand Exception Catalog:** Add Passenger 0031_02 as a key case for the "young child with zero spending" profile.
- **Synthetic Feature for Age-Spending Interaction:** Create features like `Expected_Spend_For_Age` which would be 0 for Age < 5, and `Spending_Deviation_From_Age_Mean` to normalize spending against age expectations.
- **Augmented Learning Loop:** Include age-based demographic analysis as a standard step in error review to capture similar oversight patterns.

### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v2.6**

**Report Objective:** Integrate learning from Passenger 0031_02 error, emphasizing age-contextualized interpretation of spending patterns. Optimized for batch prediction accuracy.

**Analysis Basis:** Enhanced integration of age demographics with spending behavior analysis, particularly for young children.

---

### **1. Enhanced Decision Logic: Weighted Evidence System v2.6**

**A. Evidence Rules (Apply in sequence; age-specific rules override general rules):**

*   **Base Score:** **+1**

*   **Rule C-1: Young Child Passenger (NEW)**
    *   **Condition:** `Age < 5`
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+3**
    *   **Confidence:** **90%**
    *   **Precedence:** **OVERRIDES ALL SPENDING-BASED RULES**
    *   **Rationale:** Passengers under 5 have high survival likelihood independent of personal spending due to guardian protocols and prioritized safety.

*   **Rule SH-1: Selective High-Spender Pattern**
    *   **Condition:** `Age >= 5` AND `TotalSpend > 1500` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND number of zero-spend amenities >= 2
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+3**
    *   **Confidence:** **85%**
    *   **Precedence:** **OVERRIDES RULE S-2**

*   **Rule M-2: Mars Selective Spender**
    *   **Condition:** `Age >= 5` AND `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` AND `TotalSpend > 1000` AND `FoodCourt == 0`
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+2**
    *   **Confidence:** **80%**

*   **Rule S-3: Multiple Zero-Spend Evidence (UPDATED)**
    *   **Condition:** `Age >= 5` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND number of zero-spend amenities >= 3
    *   **Score Modifier:** **-2**
    *   **Confidence:** **50%**
    *   **Rationale:** Now age-gated to avoid misapplication to children.

**(Other rules retained with age conditionals where appropriate)**

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Deployment:** Implement **Rule C-1** with highest precedence to prevent misclassification of young children.

2.  **Enhanced Batch Pre-Processing:** Update the pre-processing script to:
    - Tag passengers with `Age < 5` and ensure they are routed to Rule C-1 immediately.
    - For passengers with `Age >= 5`, compute spending patterns and apply relevant rules.

3.  **Family Group Correlation:** Develop logic to identify potential family units (e.g., same last name, cabin proximity) and apply group-consistent predictions where appropriate, especially for children.

4.  **Continuous Demographic Review:** Expand error analysis to include age band assessment to quickly identify other age-related pattern oversights.

This update refines the modelâ€™s ability to incorporate age as a primary factor, correctly handling cases like Passenger 0031_02 and improving overall batch prediction consistency.
