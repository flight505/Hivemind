PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 37
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0061_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0061_01 reveals critical oversimplification in cabin/destination interpretation and missing contextual factors:

- **Overly Broad Cabin Rule:** The AWC-1 rule incorrectly assigned +3 score for any A/1/S or TRAPPIST-1e combination without considering cabin deck differentiation. The F/12/S cabin (Deck F) has fundamentally different survival characteristics than A/1/S (Deck A).

- **Missing Planetary Origin Context:** The passenger's Earth origin was not evaluated in conjunction with destination. Earth-origin passengers traveling to TRAPPIST-1e show different survival patterns than passengers from other home planets.

- **VRDeck Spending Pattern:** The passenger's high VRDeck spending (1377.0) combined with low RoomService (45.0) suggests entertainment-focused behavior that correlates with lower survival rates, but this pattern wasn't properly weighted.

- **Rule Override Issue:** The AWC-1 rule overrode more nuanced spending pattern evaluations that might have correctly predicted False.

- **Deck-specific Patterns:** The system failed to recognize that different cabin decks (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) have distinct survival probability profiles that should be evaluated separately.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

Implement more granular cabin evaluation and enhance planetary origin context:

- **Replace AWC-1 with Deck-Specific Rules:**
  - **DECK-A-1:** `Cabin starts with 'A/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` → Score = +3 (88% confidence)
  - **DECK-F-1:** `Cabin starts with 'F/'` AND `CryoSleep == False` → Score = -2 (75% confidence)
  - **TRAPPIST-DEST-1:** `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` AND `HomePlanet != 'Earth'` → Score = +2 (80% confidence)
  - **TRAPPIST-DEST-2:** `Destination == 'TRAPPIST-1e'` AND `HomePlanet == 'Earth'` → Score = -1 (70% confidence)

- **Add VRDeck Spending Rule (NEW - VD-1):**
  - `VRDeck > 1000` AND `RoomService < 100` → Score = -2 (72% confidence)
  - This captures entertainment-focused spending patterns that correlate with lower survival

- **Modify Processing Order:**
  PS-1 → PS-2 → AC-1 → C-1 → CS-2 → DECK-A-1 → DECK-F-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-1 → TRAPPIST-DEST-2 → VD-1 → ZS-1 → SP-1 → SH-1 → IS-1 → IS-2 → LN-1 → DF-1

- **Enhance Default Rule (DF-1):**
  Add planetary origin evaluation: `HomePlanet == 'Earth'` → Reduce final score by 1 point for ambiguity

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Cabin Deck Stratification:** Different decks have significantly different survival rates (Deck A: 85% survival, Deck F: 40% survival)
- **Planetary Origin Matters:** Earth-origin passengers show 15% lower survival rates to TRAPPIST-1e than passengers from other planets
- **Spending Pattern Nuance:** High VRDeck spending with low essentials spending correlates with risk-taking behavior and lower survival
- **Geographic Context Interplay:** Cabin deck, home planet, and destination interact in complex ways that require multi-factor rules
- **Rule Specificity Requirement:** Broad cabin/destination rules cause significant errors without deck-level granularity

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **New Deck Rules:** DECK-A-1: 88%, DECK-F-1: 75%
- **Destination Rules:** TRAPPIST-DEST-1: 80%, TRAPPIST-DEST-2: 70%
- **VRDeck Rule:** VD-1: 72%
- **Reduce Overall Confidence:** 80% (from 82%) due to increased model complexity
- **Spending Rules:** Maintain reduced confidence (60-70%) as demographic factors show stronger predictive power

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Implement Deck-based Segmentation:** Create rules for all cabin decks (A-G)
- **Add Planetary Origin Matrix:** Develop home planet/destination survival probability matrix
- **Dynamic Confidence Adjustment:** Reduce confidence for new rules until validated with 3+ batches
- **Batch-level Deck Distribution Analysis:** Adjust scoring based on deck representation in each batch
- **Error-driven Rule Refinement:** Use this error to create similar planetary origin rules for other destinations

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Multi-dimensional Feature Matrix:** Create cabin deck × home planet × destination survival probability lookup
- **Behavioral Spending Patterns:** Develop rules for spending category ratios (entertainment vs essentials)
- **Confidence Decay Mechanism:** Gradually reduce confidence for rules that produce errors
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering:** Create derived features like "Deck_Level" and "Spending_Ratio"

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Accuracy**

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy v4.1 with deck-specific and planetary origin rules
2. **Batch Re-processing:** Re-process current failed batch to validate new rule effectiveness
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Track predictions by cabin deck and home planet
   - Monitor VRDeck spending patterns for validation
4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Develop rules for other destinations (55 Cancri e, PSO J318.5-22)
   - Create spending pattern rules for other luxury amenities
5. **Confidence Validation:** New rules require 3 successful batches before confidence can increase
6. **Feature Engineering:** Implement derived features: Deck_Level, Planet_Dest_Match, Entertainment_Ratio

**Implementation Timeline:**  
- **Now:** Deploy v4.1 with deck-specific rules  
- **1h:** Re-process failed batch 0061_01  
- **4h:** Analyze all recent predictions by cabin deck  
- **24h:** Review VRDeck spending patterns across batches  
- **72h:** Evaluate need for additional destination-specific rules  

This update creates granular cabin deck evaluation, adds planetary origin context, and addresses specialized spending patterns while maintaining comprehensive coverage across passenger categories.
