PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 90
============================================================

### PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v8.0  
**ENHANCED MODERATE SPENDING PATTERN RECOGNITION AND AGE-CONTEXT INTEGRATION**

---

### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0113_01**  

**Passenger Profile:**  
- PassengerId: 0113_01  
- HomePlanet: Earth  
- CryoSleep: False  
- Cabin: F/23/P (Lower-mid deck, port side)  
- Destination: TRAPPIST-1e (Common destination)  
- Age: 64.0  
- VIP: False  
- Spending: RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=804.0, Spa=0.0, VRDeck=0.0  
- Name: Idary Carvis (No significant pattern detected)  

**Key Failure Points:**  
1. **Over-Reliance on High-Spending Thresholds:** The dominant spending validation (DSV-1) required spending >2000 in a single category, missing moderate but concentrated spending patterns (e.g., ShoppingMall=804 with zeros elsewhere).  
2. **Zero-Spending Penalty Over-Application:** Universal Zero Spending Validation (USZ-1) and Luxury Spending Gap Validation (LSG-1) penalized all zeros uniformly, ignoring contextual factors like age and cabin location.  
3. **VIP-Centric Bias:** VIP-specific overrides (VSO-1) were inactive for non-VIP passengers, leaving moderate spenders vulnerable to penalties.  
4. **Age and Cabin Context Underutilized:** Older passengers (Age=64) and cabin location (Deck F) were not sufficiently integrated into spending validation logic.  
5. **Batch Size Limitations:** Single-passenger batches lacked historical context for moderate spending patterns.

### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v8.0)**  

#### **New Rules:**  
- **MODERATE_SPENDING_CONCENTRATION (MSC-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `CryoSleep == False` AND one spending category > 500 AND all other categories ≤ 100 AND total spending > 600.  
  - **Action:** Apply +20% confidence boost for True and skip zero-spending penalties (USZ-1, LSG-1).  
  - **Rationale:** Recognizes concentrated moderate spending as a positive signal, even below the "dominant" threshold.  

- **AGE_SPENDING_OVERRIDE (ASO-1):**  
  - **Condition:** `Age ≥ 60` AND total spending > 400.  
  - **Action:** Apply +10% confidence boost for True and reduce zero-spending penalties by 30%.  
  - **Rationale:** Older passengers may exhibit focused spending habits (e.g., prioritising one service) due to preferences or mobility.  

#### **Revised Rules:**  
- **USZ-1 REVISED v5:**  
  - Skip if MSC-1 or DSV-1 is activated. Apply penalty (-10%) only if total spending < 300 and no spending category > 300.  

- **LSG-1 REVISED v5:**  
  - Skip for passengers with Age ≥ 60 or moderate spending concentration (MSC-1 triggered).  

- **HEB-1 ENHANCED v3:**  
  - Extend cabin-based boosts to mid-deck (e.g., Deck F) for passengers with spending > 500, applying a +5% confidence boost.  

#### **Processing Order Adjustments:**  
- Insert MSC-1 immediately after DSV-1 (Step 0.q).  
- Insert ASO-1 after VSO-1 (Step 0.r).

### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**  
- **Moderate Spending Concentration Matters:** Passengers with focused moderate spending (e.g., one category >500, others near zero) are often transported, especially older adults.  
- **Age Correlates with Spending Patterns:** Older passengers (≥60) show lower overall spending but often concentrate expenses in one category (e.g., shopping or leisure).  
- **Non-VIP Passengers Need Contextual Safeguards:** Zero-spending penalties must be balanced with age, cabin, and moderate spending cues.  
- **Batch Enrichment for Small Batches:** Historical averages for age-based spending patterns improve single-passenger predictions.  

---

### **4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels**  
- **New Boosts:**  
  - MSC-1: +20% for moderate spending concentration.  
  - ASO-1: +10% for age ≥60 with spending >400.  
- **Adjusted Penalties:**  
  - USZ-1: Reduced to -10% (only for very low spenders).  
  - LSG-1: Reduced to -5% (skip for age ≥60 or MSC-1).  
- **Confidence Stacking for 0113_01 (Corrected):**  
  - Base Confidence: 55%  
  + MSC-1: +20% → 75%  
  + ASO-1: +10% → 85%  
  + HEB-1 Enhanced v3: +5% (Deck F, spending >500) → 90%  
  **Final Confidence: 90% for True**

### **5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency**  
- **Pre-Batch Enrichment for Small Batches:** For batches of size ≤5, enrich with historical averages of spending by age group and cabin deck.  
- **Post-Batch Validation:** Flag non-VIP passengers with moderate spending concentration (per MSC-1) predicted as False for reprocessing.  
- **Error Logging:** Track applications of MSC-1 and ASO-1 to refine thresholds.  

---

### **6. Edge Case Handling**  
- **Moderate Spenders:** MSC-1 explicitly covers cases like 0113_01.  
- **Older Passengers with Low Spending:** ASO-1 requires spending >400 to avoid false positives.  
- **NaN Spending:** Assume NaN=0 but allow MSC-1/DSV-1 to override if other categories are high.

### **Implementation Plan for v8.0**  
- **Deploy v8.0 immediately.** Reprocess batches with non-VIP, moderate spenders, and passengers aged ≥60.  
- **Enrich small batches** with age-based spending averages (e.g., "Earth passengers aged 60+ avg. spending: 620").  
- **Monitor predictions** for passengers triggering MSC-1 or ASO-1; reprocess if confidence <80%.  
- **Long-term:** Implement dynamic threshold tuning for MSC-1 based on real-time spending distribution percentiles.  

**Final Note:** Next, analyze interactions between age, cabin deck, and spending concentration for further refinement.
