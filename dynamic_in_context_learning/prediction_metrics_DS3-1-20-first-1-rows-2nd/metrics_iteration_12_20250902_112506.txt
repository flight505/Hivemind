PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 12
============================================================

### **Analysis of the Prediction Error for Passenger 0028_01**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The error for Passenger 0028_01 reveals a critical gap in how the model handles passengers with mixed spending patterns and specific planetary origins. The passenger was a 43-year-old from Mars, not in CryoSleep, with moderate spending in RoomService (1125.0) and Spa (48.0), but zero spending in FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, and VRDeck. The model likely applied the following flawed logic:

*   **Over-reliance on Total Spending Threshold:** The model may have used a total spending threshold (e.g., Rule S-2: negative modifier for high spenders) but failed to account for the uneven distribution of spending across amenities. The total spend of 1309.0 might have triggered a negative modifier, but the zero spending in three categories should have been a stronger signal.
*   **Insufficient Weight for Mars Origin:** Mars passengers with moderate but uneven spending patterns may have specific survival profiles that current metrics do not capture. The existing rules might undervalue the combination of `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` with partial zero-spending.
*   **Ignored Spending Pattern Nuance:** The model treated total spending as a monolithic feature rather than analyzing the pattern across individual amenities. The presence of zero spending in multiple categories alongside moderate spending in others creates a mixed signal that requires specialized handling.
*   **Cabin Location Consideration:** Cabin F/8/P might not have strong modifiers in current rules, but its interaction with Mars origin and spending patterns was not properly evaluated.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
The rules must be enhanced to recognize and properly weight mixed spending patterns, particularly for specific planetary origins.

*   **Introduce Pattern-Based Spending Rules:** Create new rules that analyze spending distribution across amenities rather than relying solely on total spending. For Mars passengers, multiple zero-spend categories should trigger a positive modifier.
*   **Adjust Planetary Origin Rules:** Enhance Mars-specific rules to account for spending pattern interactions. Mars passengers with partial zero-spending may have different survival probabilities than those with uniform spending patterns.
*   **Implement Multi-Feature Interaction Rules:** Create rules that specifically handle combinations of `HomePlanet == 'Mars'`, `CryoSleep == False`, and specific spending patterns across multiple amenities.
*   **Refine Cabin Rules:** Cabin location modifiers should be secondary to planetary origin and spending pattern signals for non-CryoSleep passengers.

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
*   **Spending Pattern Matters More Than Total:** The distribution of spending across amenities appears to be more informative than total spending amount for certain planetary groups.
*   **Mars-Specific Behavioral Patterns:** Mars passengers may have different spending habits that correlate with survival probabilities, possibly related to their cultural background or economic status.
*   **Non-Linear Spending Effects:** The relationship between spending and survival may not be monotonic; moderate spenders with specific spending patterns may have different outcomes than both low and high spenders.
*   **Amenity-Specific Signals:** Zero spending in certain amenities (particularly FoodCourt and VRDeck) may carry different weight than others for prediction.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
*   **Increase Confidence for Pattern-Based Rules:** New rules analyzing spending distribution should be introduced with ~80% confidence initially.
*   **Reduce Confidence in Simple Total Spending Rules:** Confidence in total spending-based rules should be reduced to 60% when dealing with non-CryoSleep passengers from Mars.
*   **Adjust Planetary Origin Confidence:** Mars-specific rules should have confidence increased to 75% when combined with spending pattern analysis.
*   **Overall Model Confidence:** The overall model confidence should target ~87% batch accuracy with these enhancements.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
*   **Pattern Recognition Priority:** Implement a rule hierarchy where spending pattern analysis takes precedence over simple total spending thresholds for non-CryoSleep passengers.
*   **Multi-Dimensional Feature Analysis:** Continuously analyze interactions between HomePlanet, spending patterns across all amenities, and cabin location.
*   **Batch Pre-Processing:** For future batches, pre-identify passengers with mixed spending patterns and apply planetary-specific modifiers first.
*   **Error Case Integration:** Use this specific error case to validate new pattern-based rules before full deployment.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
*   **Exception Handler Expansion:** Add new exception rules for specific planetary origin and spending pattern combinations.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a system that reduces the weight of total spending rules when pattern-based rules are activated.
*   **Cross-Validation with Mixed Spending Cases:** Use this and similar error cases to validate new pattern recognition rules.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Create new derived features that capture spending pattern information (e.g., "number_of_zero_spend_amenities").

### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v2.4**

**Report Objective:** Integrate learning from Passenger 0028_01 error, emphasizing spending pattern analysis and planetary origin interactions. Optimized for batch prediction accuracy.

**Analysis Basis:** Integrated learning from all previous error cases, with focus on mixed spending patterns and Mars origin specifics.

### **1. Enhanced Decision Logic: Weighted Evidence System v2.4**

**A. Evidence Rules (Apply all relevant rules and sum the modifiers):**

*   **Base Score:** **+1**

    *   **Condition:** `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` AND `CryoSleep == False` AND number of zero-spend amenities ≥ 3
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+3**
    *   **Confidence:** **80%**
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the 0028_01 error. Mars passengers with multiple zero-spend categories show distinct survival patterns.

*   **Rule S-3: Amenity-Specific Spending Analysis (NEW)**
    *   **Condition:** `FoodCourt == 0` AND `VRDeck == 0` (for non-CryoSleep passengers)
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+2**

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Implementation:** Deploy the new **Rule M-1** and **S-3** with updated **Rule S-1** and **S-2**. This will correct this error class immediately.

2.  **Exception Handler Module Update:** Add the new pattern recognition rules to the exception handler:
    *   **Rule:** `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` AND number of zero-spend amenities ≥ 3 -> **Pattern: Mars_Mixed_Spending**

3.  **Batch Pre-Processing:** Implement a first-pass filter to identify all passengers with mixed spending patterns and apply planetary-specific rules before evaluating other features.

4.  **Confidence-Based Processing:** Process passengers with clear pattern-based rules first, then handle more ambiguous cases, improving overall batch accuracy.

5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor for similar patterns involving other planetary origins to proactively identify new spending pattern interactions.

6.  **Feature Engineering Enhancement:** Create and test new derived features like "zero_spend_count" and "spending_pattern_variance" for improved pattern recognition.

This update significantly enhances the model's ability to handle complex spending patterns and planetary interactions, ensuring higher accuracy in batch predictions by learning from critical errors.
