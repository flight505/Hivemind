PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 77
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.2 (CRYOSLEEP ZERO-SPENDING VALIDATION UPDATE)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0103_02 by addressing a critical oversight in CryoSleep passenger handling: the failure to recognize that CryoSleep=True passengers with all-zero spending (including NaN-imputed zeros) are often legitimately transported, especially children on family-oriented destinations like 55 Cancri e. This passenger was incorrectly penalized due to overly aggressive zero-diversity penalties that did not account for CryoSleep context.

---

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0103_02: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0103_02 (Age=9.0, CryoSleep=True, All Spending=0.0 or NaN→0.0, Destination=55 Cancri e, HomePlanet=Earth, VIP=False, Cabin=G/18/S) resulted from a single major failure in v7.1 rules:

**Key Failure Point:**
- **CryoSleep Context Blind Spot in Zero-Diversity Penalty:** The ZDL-1 rule (NAN-AWARE & LEISURE-EXEMPT) applied a -15% penalty when `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` OR (`Total_Spend_All_Categories < 10.0` AND `Spa + VRDeck < 10.0`). However, it did not exempt CryoSleep=True passengers, who are typically in suspended animation and expected to have zero spending. This caused a false negative for passengers like 0103_02, who is a child (Age=9) traveling to a family-friendly destination (55 Cancri e) and correctly transported despite no spending.
- **Insufficient Age-Destination Context for CryoSleep:** No rule specifically boosted confidence for young CryoSleep passengers on destinations known for family travel, where children often accompany adults without personal spending.

---

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.2)

This update introduces a CryoSleep exemption to the zero-diversity penalty and enhances contextual rules for age and destination synergies in CryoSleep cases.

**Modify Zero-Diversity Penalty Rule (Step 1):**
- **ZDL-1 REVISED (CRYOSLEEP-EXEMPT):**
  - Apply penalty **only if** `CryoSleep == False` AND (`Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` OR (`Total_Spend_All_Categories < 10.0` AND `Spa + VRDeck < 10.0`)). Penalty remains **-15%**.
  - **Rationale:** CryoSleep passengers should be exempt from zero-spending penalties, as their state precludes spending.

**Enhance CryoSleep Contextual Override (Step 0.a):**
- **CSO-1 ENHANCED v3 (CRYOSLEEP WITH DESTINATION-AGE CONTEXT):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == True` AND `Age < 18` AND `Destination in [55 Cancri e, PSO J318.5-22]` → **Apply +8% confidence boost**.
  - **Rationale:** Children in CryoSleep on family-oriented destinations are highly likely to be transported even with zero spending.

**Add Pre-Screening for CryoSleep Zero-Spending (New Step 0.i):**
- **CRYOSLEEP_ZERO_SPENDING_VALIDATION (CZS-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == True` AND all spending categories (NaN→0) == 0.0 → **Route directly to CSO-1 Enhanced v3 and bypass ZDL-1**.
  - **Rationale:** Isolate CryoSleep zero-spending cases for specialized handling to prevent erroneous penalties.

---

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **CryoSleep Overrides Spending Patterns:** Passengers in CryoSleep are biologically inactive and cannot spend; zero spending should not be penalized and may indicate normal transport eligibility.
- **Age and Destination Matter for CryoSleep Passengers:** Children (Age<18) on destinations like 55 Cancri e (known for family tourism) are often transported alongside paying adults, even with no personal spending.
- **Batch Consistency Requires CryoSleep-Aware Penalties:** Uniform exemption for CryoSleep in spending-based penalties is essential to avoid systematic false negatives.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - CSO-1 Enhanced v3 (CryoSleep child on family destination): **+8% confidence boost**
- **Adjusted Rules:**
  - ZDL-1: Now only applies to CryoSleep=False cases; penalty remains -15%.
- **Default Confidence:**
  - DF-1: Maintained at **70% confidence**.

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add a tenth pre-screening group:
  - **GROUP CRYOSLEEP_ZERO_SPENDING:** `CryoSleep == True` AND all spending categories (NaN→0) == 0.0 → Send to CZS-1 rule for processing.
- **Batch CryoSleep Validation:** Implement a pre-batch check to flag all CryoSleep=True passengers and ensure ZDL-1 is not applied.
- **Error Logging:** Monitor CryoSleep cases with zero spending to verify that exemptions are functioning correctly.

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **CryoSleep with Zero Spending:** Handled by CZS-1 and CSO-1 Enhanced v3, with exemption from ZDL-1.
- **CryoSleep with Non-Zero Spending:** Already handled by existing rules (e.g., VCSP-1).
- **Fallback:** If CryoSleep is True but spending is non-zero, retain existing logic for CryoSleep spending validation.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0103_02 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.2 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0103_02** (Earth, CryoSleep=True, Cabin=G/18/S, Destination=55 Cancri e, Age=9.0, VIP=False, All Spending=0.0) | **NVA-1**: All NaN→0.0 → **CZS-1**: Activated (CryoSleep=True, all spending=0) → Bypass ZDL-1 → **CSO-1 Enhanced v3**: Activated (Age=9<18, Destination=55 Cancri e) → +8% boost → **PS-1** → **ACB-2**: Not triggered (luxury=0) → **DF-1** | **True** | **78%** (PS-1: 70% + CSO-1 Enhanced v3: 8%) |

*The new CZS-1 and enhanced CSO-1 v3 rules correctly exempt CryoSleep zero-spending passengers from penalties and apply context boosts, resulting in a True prediction.*

---

### Implementation Plan for v7.2

- **Deploy v7.2 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0103_02 is now True.
- **Monitor** CryoSleep cases with zero spending to ensure no false negatives.
- **Update historical batches** with CryoSleep exemptions and context rules.
- **Long-term:** Develop a sub-model for CryoSleep passenger profiling that incorporates family group detection (e.g., shared cabins) for finer-grained predictions.

This update ensures robust handling of CryoSleep zero-spending passengers, eliminating false negatives and improving accuracy for family and child transport cases.

**Final Note:** Next, analyze interactions between CryoSleep and group travel patterns (e.g., same cabin clusters) to enhance context rules.
