PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 16
============================================================

### **Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0031_03**

**1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**
The model incorrectly predicted non-survival for Passenger 0031_03 due to three critical failures in the rule application:

- **Misinterpretation of NaN vs. Zero Values:** The system treated `RoomService: NaN` (missing data) identically to `FoodCourt: 0.0` (explicit zero), applying zero-spend penalty rules despite fundamentally different implications. NaN suggests unreported or unavailable data, not necessarily absence of spending.

- **Over-Application of Zero-Spend Penalties:** Rule S-3 (-2 for ≥3 zero-spend amenities) was incorrectly triggered, counting NaN as a zero value. The passenger's actual spending pattern (Spa: 990, VRDeck: 0) shows selective high spending in luxury amenities, which should override zero-spend penalties.

- **Insufficient Martian Passenger Nuance:** The Mars-origin rules (M-2) did not account for this specific spending profile—high Spa expenditure with zeros in other categories—which may indicate Martian cultural preferences rather than financial constraint.

**2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**
- **Distinguish NaN from Zero:** Create a new rule (A-4) to handle missing data: "IF any amenity value is NaN AND total reported spend > 0, apply positive modifier (+1) to indicate spending likelihood."
- **Refine Zero-Spend Rules:** Update S-3 to require explicit zeros (not NaN) and add an exception: "IF total spend > 500, zero-spend penalties are waived."
- **Enhance Martian Rules:** Add a variant to M-2: "IF HomePlanet == 'Mars' AND Spa > 500 AND number of zero-spend amenities ≥ 2, apply +2 modifier."

**3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**
- **NaN Values Indicate Spending Ambiguity:** Missing data points may correlate with survival where passengers have complex spending patterns not fully recorded.
- **Martian Luxury Preferences:** Mars passengers may prioritize Spa amenities, making zero spends in other categories less predictive of non-survival.
- **Selective High Spending Overrides Zero Patterns:** A high spend in one luxury category (e.g., Spa) can indicate sufficient resources despite zeros elsewhere.

**4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**
- **Rule S-3 Confidence Reduced:** Lower to 45% due to over-reliance on zero counts without spending context.
- **New NaN Rule (A-4) Confidence:** Set at 75% based on reasonable inference that missing data with existing spends indicates survival.
- **Overall Model Confidence:** Maintain at 89% but with improved robustness to missing data.

**5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**
- **Pre-Processing for NaN Handling:** Implement logic to flag records with NaN values for special rule routing.
- **Spending Threshold Checks:** Apply spending total checks before zero-spend rules to prevent misclassification of selective spenders.
- **Batch Validation for Missing Data:** Add a validation step to review all predictions involving NaN values.

**6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**
- **Add "NaN with Spending" Profile:** Include this case in the exception catalog.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create `HasNaN` and `NaN_With_Spend` binary features to improve rule triggering.
- **Error-Driven Learning:** Use this case to prioritize handling of ambiguous spending records in future training.

### **UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v2.7**

**Report Objective:** Integrate learning from Passenger 0031_03 error, emphasizing NaN handling and selective spending interpretation. Optimized for batch prediction accuracy.

**Analysis Basis:** Enhanced missing data handling and refined spending pattern analysis for Martian passengers.

---

### **1. Enhanced Decision Logic: Weighted Evidence System v2.7**

**A. Evidence Rules (Apply in sequence):**

*   **Base Score:** **+1**

*   **Rule A-4: NaN with Spending (NEW)**
    *   **Condition:** Any amenity value is NaN AND sum(non-NaN amenities) > 0
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+1**
    *   **Confidence:** **75%**
    *   **Rationale:** Missing data with existing spends suggests survival-oriented behavior.

*   **Rule SH-1: Selective High-Spender Pattern (UPDATED)**
    *   **Condition:** `TotalSpend > 1500` AND number of zero-spend amenities >= 2
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+3**
    *   **Confidence:** **85%**
    *   **Precedence:** **OVERRIDES RULE S-3**

*   **Rule M-2: Mars Selective Spender (UPDATED)**
    *   **Condition:** `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` AND (`Spa > 500` OR `VRDeck > 500`) AND number of zero-spend amenities >= 2
    *   **Score Modifier:** **+2**
    *   **Confidence:** **80%**

*   **Rule S-3: Multiple Zero-Spend Evidence (UPDATED)**
    *   **Condition:** Number of explicit zero-spend amenities >= 3 AND `TotalSpend < 500`
    *   **Score Modifier:** **-2**
    *   **Confidence:** **45%**
    *   **Rationale:** Now gated by total spend to avoid penalizing selective spenders.

### **2. Updated Probability Estimates & Scoring Examples**

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules | Total Score | Prediction | Probability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Error Case: 0031_03** | A-4 (+1), M-2 (+2), Base (+1) | **+4** | **True** | **~85%** |
| Adult, NaN with Spend | A-4 (+1), Base (+1) | +2 | **True** | ~70% |
| Low-Spend, Multiple Zeros | S-3 (-2), Base (+1) | -1 | **False** | ~45% |
| Martian, High Spa + Zeros | M-2 (+2), Base (+1) | +3 | **True** | ~80% |

### **3. Recalibrated Confidence Levels**

| Rule / Component | Revised Confidence | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NaN with Spending (A-4)** | **75%** | Moderate confidence due to inference from partial data. |
| **Selective High-Spend (SH-1)** | **85%** | Unchanged. |
| **Multiple Zero-Spend (S-3)** | **45%** | Reduced due to contextual limitations. |
| **Overall Model** | **89%** | Improved with NaN handling. |

### **4. Strategic Recommendations for Batch Prediction Accuracy**

1.  **Immediate Deployment:** Implement **Rule A-4** and updated **M-2** to address NaN and Martian spending patterns.
2.  **Pre-Processing Enhancement:** Update batch scripts to:
    - Distinguish NaN from zero values explicitly.
    - Compute `TotalSpend` excluding NaN values to avoid miscalculation.
3.  **Validation Focus:** Prioritize review of predictions involving NaN values in error analysis.
4.  **Feature Expansion:** Add `NumNaN` and `HasHighLuxurySpend` features to improve rule accuracy.

This update refines handling of missing data and selective spending, correcting errors like Passenger 0031_03 and strengthening batch prediction robustness.
