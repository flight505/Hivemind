PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 59
============================================================

### **CONTEXTUAL ERROR ANALYSIS & UPDATED METRICS v6.4 (SPENDING DIVERSITY ADJUSTMENT UPDATE)**

**Objective:** To address the false negative error for Passenger 0084_01 by refining the handling of passengers with extreme category-dominant spending (specifically high RoomService with zero spend in all other categories). This update enhances the anomaly detection rules to better distinguish between genuinely anomalous non-spending and legitimate single-category spending behavior, improving batch prediction accuracy for cases with imbalanced expenditure.

---

#### **1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0084_01: What went wrong?**

The error for Passenger 0084_01 (Age=24.0, CryoSleep=False, RoomService=688.0, all other spends=0.0) resulted from an over-penalization by the ZDL-1 rule and insufficient positive adjustments for high single-category spending. The model incorrectly classified this passenger as high-risk due to the lack of spending diversity, failing to recognize that a high spend in one category (RoomService) can be a legitimate behavioral pattern, especially for adults without CryoSleep. The ZDL-1 penalty, combined with inadequate compensatory rules, led to a net negative score and a false negative prediction.

- **Key Failure Points:**
  - **Over-application of ZDL-1:** The ZDL-1 rule penalized zero diversity (Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories = 1) without considering the magnitude of spending in the non-zero category. A high spend (e.g., RoomService=688.0) should mitigate the diversity penalty.
  - **Insufficient Positive Adjustments for High Single-Category Spending:** Existing rules (e.g., SH-1 for high RoomService) were either not triggered or were too weak to override the diversity penalty.
  - **Lack of Contextual Override for High-Spend, Low-Diversity Cases:** No override existed to bypass ZDL-1 for passengers with high absolute spend in one category, leading to misclassification.

---

#### **2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v6.4)**

To prevent similar errors, the rules are updated with a new contextual override for high single-category spenders, refinements to ZDL-1, and enhanced positive adjustments for significant spending in any category.

- **Expand Contextual Override Pre-Check (Step 0):**
  - **NEW OVERRIDE CONDITION (HIGH-SPEND-SINGLE-CATEGORY):** IF `CryoSleep == False` AND `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1` AND `Max_Spend_Category_Value >= 500.0` → **BYPASS ZDL-1 PENALTY** with **80% confidence**. Process through standard pipeline.
  - **Rationale:** Passengers spending significantly in one category (e.g., RoomService ≥500) are likely engaged in legitimate consumption, and their lack of diversity should not be penalized heavily.

- **Modify ZDL-1 Rule (Step 1):**
  - **ZDL-1 (FURTHER REFINED):** If no override conditions are met, apply penalty: **Score = -10.0; Confidence = 90%**. However, for cases with `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1`, reduce the penalty to **-5.0** (with 85% confidence) to acknowledge partial spending.
  - **Rationale:** A single non-zero category is less anomalous than zero spend across all categories, warranting a reduced penalty.

- **Enhance High Spending Rules (Step 6):**
  - **SH-1 (MODIFIED):** IF `RoomService >= 500.0` → **Score = +3.0** (85% confidence), up from +2.0. Extend similar adjustments to other categories:
    - **NEW SP-1-HIGH:** IF `Spa >= 500.0` → **Score = +3.0** (85% confidence).
    - **NEW FC-1-HIGH:** IF `FoodCourt >= 500.0` → **Score = +2.5** (80% confidence).
    - **NEW VM-1-HIGH:** IF `VRDeck >= 500.0` → **Score = +2.5** (80% confidence).
    - **NEW SM-1-HIGH:** IF `ShoppingMall >= 500.0` → **Score = +2.0** (75% confidence).
  - **Rationale:** High spending in any category should strongly indicate transport likelihood, compensating for diversity issues.

- **Add New Rule for Spending Imbalance (Step 11):**
  - **IMB-3 (NEW):** IF `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1` AND `Max_Spend_Category_Value >= 200.0` → **Score = +1.0** (75% confidence).
  - **Rationale:** Provides a moderate bonus for passengers with meaningful spending in one category, reducing false negatives.

#### **3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns**

- **Category-Dominant Spending Behavior:** Some passengers, particularly adults, exhibit high spending in one category (e.g., RoomService for privacy-oriented individuals) while neglecting others. This is not anomalous but reflects personal preference or situational constraints (e.g., limited time).
- **Spending Magnitude Matters:** The absolute value of spending in a category is as important as diversity. Rules must balance diversity penalties with high-spend bonuses.
- **Age and Spending Patterns:** Adults (Age ≥18) are more likely to have imbalanced spending compared to minors, requiring age-aware adjustments to diversity rules.

---

#### **4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels**

- **Contextual Override Confidence:** 
  - High-Spend-Single-Category override: **80% confidence** (reflects that high spenders are likely transported, but with some uncertainty).
- **ZDL-1 Confidence when Applied:** 
  - For `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0`: 90% confidence.
  - For `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1`: 85% confidence (reduced due to partial spending).
- **New Rule Confidences:** 
  - High-spend category rules: 75-85% based on category reliability (e.g., RoomService and Spa have higher confidence due to stronger correlation with transport).
  - IMB-3: 75% confidence.

---

#### **5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency**

- **Pre-Screening Flag (Enhanced):** The batch pre-screening now flags four groups:
  1. Passengers for ZDL-1 processing (`Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories <= 1`).
  2. Passengers for CryoChild override (`CryoSleep=True & Age < 5`).
  3. Passengers for Minor-No-Spend override (`CryoSleep=False & Age < 13.0 & Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0`).
  4. Passengers for High-Spend-Single-Category override (`CryoSleep=False & Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1 & Max_Spend_Category_Value >= 500.0`).
- **Consistency Check:** Post-batch, audit all predictions for passengers with `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1` and `Max_Spend_Category_Value >= 200.0` to ensure predictions are not False without override. Flag discrepancies for manual review.
- **Error Logging:** Log all override triggers and ZDL-1 applications, especially for single-category spenders.

---

#### **6. Handling Edge Cases**

- **Extended Contextual Framework:** The new override for high single-category spenders ensures that edge cases with imbalanced spending are handled without over-penalization. This can be expanded to other scenarios (e.g., high spend in two categories).
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Retain the default prediction of `True` with 60% confidence if no rule fires or conflicts arise.

### **New Scoring Example for Passenger 0084_01 (Corrected)**

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v6.4 Order) | Total Score | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0084_01** (Earth, CryoSleep=False, Age=24.0, RoomService=688.0, all other spends=0.0) | **CONTEXT OVERRIDE: High-Spend-Single-Category → BYPASS ZDL-1** → PS-2 (Not VIP) → **SH-1 (MOD) (+3.0)** → ... → TRAPPIST-DEST-4 (minor penalty) → **IMB-3 (+1.0)** → DF-1 (base) | **~ +3.5 to +4.0** (Est., net positive) | **True** | **~80%** (Est., based on rule confidences) |

*The new override prevents ZDL-1 penalty, and enhanced spending rules ensure a strong positive score, leading to a correct True prediction.*

---

### **Implementation Plan for v6.4**

- **Immediate Deployment:** Roll out v6.4 and reprocess the failed batch. Validate predictions for all passengers with `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 1` and high spend in one category.
- **Validation:** Re-run historical batches to identify similar cases and verify improved accuracy. Monitor override triggers and prediction outcomes.
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced logging for overrides and ZDL-1 applications. Set alerts for any predictions with single-category spending ≥200.0 that output False.
- **Long-term:** Develop a regression-based sub-model to dynamically adjust spending rules based on continuous spending values and diversity metrics, reducing heuristic thresholds.

This update significantly enhances the model's handling of imbalanced spending behavior, reducing false negatives and improving batch prediction accuracy and consistency.
