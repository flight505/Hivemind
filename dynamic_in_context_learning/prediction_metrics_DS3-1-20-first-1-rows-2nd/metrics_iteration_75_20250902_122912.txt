PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 75
============================================================

### UPDATED PREDICTIVE METRICS REPORT v7.0 (LEISURE-SKEWED SPENDING VALIDATION UPDATE)

**Objective:** To correct the prediction error for Passenger 0102_01 by addressing the failure to process cases with asymmetric spending patterns where low or zero spending in basic categories (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall) coexists with significant spending in luxury categories (Spa, VRDeck), particularly for non-CryoSleep passengers. This passenger was incorrectly dropped (predicted as None) due to inadequate validation of leisure-focused spending behaviors that indicate genuine engagement despite minimal essential spending.

#### 1. Analysis of Prediction Error for Passenger 0102_01: What Went Wrong?

The error for Passenger 0102_01 (Age=18.0, CryoSleep=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=830.0, VRDeck=91.0, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, HomePlanet=Earth, VIP=False, Cabin=F/23/S) occurred because the model did not account for passengers who prioritize luxury/experience spending over basic amenities—a common pattern among younger passengers on leisure-oriented routes like TRAPPIST-1e.

**Key Failure Points:**
- **Overreliance on Aggregate Spending Metrics:** Rules like ZDL-1 and MDS-1 focused on total spending or category diversity without considering skewed distributions where luxury spending compensates for low basic spending.
- **Inadequate Handling of Non-CryoSleep Asymmetric Spending:** The system lacked a mechanism to validate cases where `CryoSleep=False` but spending is highly concentrated in luxury categories (Spa/VRDeck > 500 combined) with minimal basic spending (<100 across RoomService/FoodCourt/ShoppingMall).
- **Age and Destination Context Gaps:** While TRAPPIST-1e is a leisure destination, the model did not incorporate spending pattern exceptions for adults (Age≥18) with high luxury expenditure.
- **Zero-Spending Penalty Over-application:** ZDL-1 penalized this passenger for having zero spending in three categories despite meaningful activity in others, leading to a "None" prediction.

#### 2. Critical Modifications to Decision Rules (v7.0)

This update introduces a new rule to detect and validate leisure-skewed spending patterns, enhances existing spending checks to account for category asymmetry, and refines age-based context for luxury-oriented travel.

**New Leisure-Skewed Spending Rule (Insert as Step 0.g):**
- **LEISURE_SKEWED_SPENDING_VALIDATION (LSSV-1):**
  - IF `CryoSleep == False` AND (`Spa + VRDeck >= 500.0`) AND (`RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall <= 100.0`) → **Bypass zero-diversity penalties** and **apply +10% confidence boost**.
  - **Rationale:** Passengers spending heavily on luxury experiences while minimizing basic costs are likely engaged true positives, especially on leisure routes.

**Refine Zero-Diversity Penalty Rule (Step 1):**
- **ZDL-1 (LEISURE-AWARE):**
  - Apply zero-diversity penalty **only if** `Number_of_NonZero_Spend_Categories == 0` OR (`Total_Spend_All_Categories < 300.0` AND `Spa + VRDeck < 200.0`). Penalty remains **-15%**.
  - **Rationale:** Exempt passengers with significant luxury spending (>200 in Spa/VRDeck) from penalties even if basic spending is low.

**Enhance Destination Context (Step 2.5):**
- **CSP-1 ENHANCED (LEISURE DESTINATIONS):**
  - For TRAPPIST-1e: IF `Destination == TRAPPIST-1e` AND `Spa + VRDeck >= 400.0` → **Add +4% confidence boost** (common for luxury spending on resort planets).

**Adjust Age-Based Rules (Step 3):**
- **AGE_CONTEXTUAL_BOOST (ACB-2):**
  - For adults (Age≥18): IF `Age >= 18.0` AND `Spa + VRDeck >= 600.0` → **Add +3% confidence boost** (adults often splurge on experiences).

#### 3. New Insights on Passenger Transport Patterns

- **Leisure-Skewed Spending Is a Valid Pattern:** Passengers, especially adults on vacation routes, may prioritize luxury experiences (Spa/VRDeck) over basic amenities, indicating engagement rather than disengagement.
- **Non-CryoSleep Adults Show Spending Asymmetry:** Unlike CryoSleep passengers, awake adults often exhibit varied spending habits, with luxury-focused patterns being common on destinations like TRAPPIST-1e.
- **Zero-Diversity Penalties Need Category Weighting:** Penalizing based solely on category count is flawed; luxury spending should offset low basic spending.
- **Batch Processing Blind Spot:** Cases with high luxury/low basic spending were not flagged in pre-screening, causing them to fall through to punitive rules.

---

#### 4. Recalibration of Confidence Levels

- **New Rule Confidences:**
  - LSSV-1: **+10% confidence boost**
  - CSP-1 Enhanced (TRAPPIST-1e with luxury spending): **+4% confidence boost**
  - ACB-2 (Adult luxury spending): **+3% confidence boost**
- **Default Confidence:**
  - DF-1: Maintained at **70% confidence**.
- **Adjusted Penalties:**
  - ZDL-1: **-15% penalty** (only for truly low/sparse spending without luxury compensation).

---

#### 5. Adjustments for Batch Consistency

- **Pre-Screening Expansion:** Add an eighth pre-screening group:
  - **GROUP LEISURE_SKEWED_SPENDING:** `CryoSleep == False` AND `Spa + VRDeck >= 500.0` AND `RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall <= 100.0` → Send to LSSV-1 rule.
- **Batch Validation Check:** Post-batch, verify that all passengers with leisure-skewed spending (as defined above) receive LSSV-1 boost and are not predicted None. Flag any exceptions.
- **Error Logging:** Log all LSSV-1 triggers and monitor for false positives (e.g., cases where high luxury spending is accidental or anomalous).

---

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases

- **Leisure-Skewed Spending without CryoSleep:** Handled by LSSV-1 rule.
- **Low Luxury Spending with Zero Basics:** Handled by ZDL-1 (penalized unless total spending >300).
- **Fallback:** Enhanced validation ensures no engaged passengers are missed due to spending asymmetry.

### New Scoring Example for Passenger 0102_01 (Corrected)

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v7.0 Order) | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0102_01** (Earth, CryoSleep=False, Cabin=F/23/S, Destination=TRAPPIST-1e, Age=18.0, VIP=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=0.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=830.0, VRDeck=91.0) | **LSSV-1**: Activated (Spa+VRDeck=921≥500, Basics=0≤100) → +10% boost → **ZDL-1**: Bypassed (luxury spending compensates) → **PS-1** → **CSP-1 Enhanced**: +4% for TRAPPIST-1e/luxury spending → **ACB-2**: +3% for adult luxury spending → **DF-1** | **True** | **87%** (PS-1: 70% + LSSV-1: 10% + CSP-1: 4% + ACB-2: 3%) |

*The new LSSV-1 rule and enhanced context correctly process leisure-skewed spending, resulting in a True prediction.*

### Implementation Plan for v7.0

- **Deploy v7.0 immediately.** Reprocess the batch; validate 0102_01 is now True.
- **Monitor** LSSV-1 trigger rates and adjust boosts if false positives emerge (e.g., reduce boost if Age<12 with high luxury spending).
- **Update historical batches** to ensure consistency for leisure-skewed spending cases.
- **Long-term:** Integrate spending cluster analysis to auto-detect asymmetric patterns using ML.

This update ensures that leisure-focused spending patterns are properly validated, eliminating unprocessed predictions and improving accuracy for experience-oriented passengers.

**Final Note:** Continue monitoring spending asymmetry across destinations and age groups. Next, analyze interactions between luxury spending and VIP status.
