PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 52
============================================================

### **ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ERROR FOR PASSENGER 0076_01**

---

#### **1. What specific patterns in the current metrics led to this prediction error?**

The error for Passenger 0076_01 reveals a persistent issue with how spending patterns are evaluated, particularly when high secondary spending exists but falls just below diversity bonus thresholds. The current metrics still over-penalized based on zero-spend categories and max/second-highest ratio without adequate consideration of contextual factors.

- **Insufficient Diversity Bonus Triggering:** Despite having a significant secondary spend (Spa=1018.0), the max/second-highest ratio (147.0/1018.0 ≈ 0.144) did not meet the DIV-1 threshold (<10) because the ratio was too low (indicating good diversity), but the rule required `SecondHighest(spend) > 500` which was satisfied (1018>500) and `TotalSpend > 2000` (1165<2000) which failed.
- **Over-penalization from Zero-Spend Rules:** The presence of three zero-spend categories (RoomService=0, ShoppingMall=0, VRDeck=0) triggered multiple penalties from rules like IMB-2 (-1 per zero category) and possibly XSP-1 if evaluated, despite the meaningful spending in FoodCourt and Spa.
- **Deck and Demographic Factors Undervalued:** The passenger is on Deck F, which has a negative association, and from Mars, which may have different survival dynamics. Current deck rules (DECK-F-1: score -2) applied a strong penalty that wasn't sufficiently counterbalanced.
- **Total Spend Below High-Spend Threshold:** With TotalSpend=1165, the passenger didn't qualify for high-spend bonuses (SH-1 requires >1500), missing potential positive signals.
- **Confidence Over-reliance on Penalties:** High-confidence penalty rules (e.g., DECK-F-1 at 80%) dominated the scoring, while potential positive indicators had lower confidence or failed to trigger.

---

#### **2. How should the decision rules be modified to prevent similar errors?**

The rules need to be adjusted to better capture cases with moderate total spend but good spending distribution, and to reduce the impact of deck penalties when other positive factors are present.

- **Revise Diversity Bonus for Moderate Spenders:**
  - **DIV-2 (NEW):** `TotalSpend between 500 and 2000` AND `Max(spend) / SecondHighest(spend) < 5` AND `SecondHighest(spend) > 300` → **Score = +1** (70% confidence)
  - **Rationale:** Catches cases like 0076_01 where total spend is modest but spending is well-distributed (FoodCourt=147, Spa=1018, ratio=0.144<5).

- **Modify Zero-Spend Penalty with Spending Level Context:**
  - **IMB-2 (MODIFIED):** `Any spending category == 0` AND `TotalSpend > 200` → Score = -0.5 per zero category (60% confidence), but if DIV-2 triggers, reduce penalty by 50%.
  - **Rationale:** Less harsh penalties for zero spends when total spend is low to moderate and diversity is good.

- **Enhance Deck Rules with Spending Diversity Override:**
  - **DECK-F-1 (MODIFIED):** `Cabin starts with 'F/'` → **Score = -2** (75% confidence), but if DIV-2 triggers, change to **-1**.
  - **Add Mars-Specific Rule:**
    - **MARS-SP-1 (NEW):** `HomePlanet == 'Mars'` AND `Spa > 500` AND `FoodCourt > 100` → **Score = +1** (65% confidence)
    - **Rationale:** Mars passengers with substantial Spa and FoodCourt spending may have higher survival rates.

- **Adjust High-Spend Rule Lower Threshold:**
  - **SH-2 (NEW):** `CryoSleep == False` AND `TotalSpend between 800 and 1500` AND `Number of zero-spend categories <= 3` AND `Max(spend) / SecondHighest(spend) < 8` → **Score = +1** (68% confidence)

---

#### **3. What new insights does this error reveal about passenger transport patterns?**

- **Moderate Spenders with Good Distribution Can Survive:** Passengers with total spend between 500-2000 and a balanced spending ratio (e.g., max/second_highest <5) may have favorable survival outcomes, even on riskier decks.
- **Deck Penalties Should Be Context-Sensitive:** Deck F penalties need to be mitigated when spending diversity is present, as not all Deck F passengers have the same risk profile.
- **HomePlanet-Specific Patterns Exist:** Mars passengers with high Spa and FoodCourt spending may exhibit survival-favorable behaviors, similar to Europa patterns but with different category emphases.
- **Thresholds for Diversity Bonuses Need Tiering:** Diversity bonuses should apply to multiple total spend ranges (low, moderate, high) to capture edge cases.

---

#### **4. How should confidence levels be recalibrated?**

- **Reduce Confidence for Deck Penalties When Diversity Present:** DECK-F-1 confidence drops to 60% if DIV-2 triggers.
- **Increase Confidence for New Diversity Rules:** DIV-2: 70%, MARS-SP-1: 65%.
- **Dynamic Confidence for Zero-Spend Penalties:** IMB-2 confidence reduces by 15% if `SecondHighest(spend) > 300`.
- **Batch-Level Adjustment:** For batches with average `TotalSpend between 500-2000`, increase confidence of diversity rules by 5%.

---

#### **5. What adjustments are needed for better consistency?**

- **Processing Order Update:** Move DIV-2 and MARS-SP-1 to process immediately after IMB-2 but before deck rules.
- **Feature Engineering:** Add `Spending_Ratio` = max/second_highest as a core feature.
- **Cross-Rule Validation:** If DIV-2 triggers, reduce IMB-2 penalty by 50% and DECK-F-1 penalty by 50%.
- **Batch Pre-Screening:** Flag passengers with `TotalSpend 500-2000` and `SecondHighest(spend) > 300` for enhanced evaluation.

---

#### **6. How can the metrics be improved to handle edge cases like this one?**

- **Introduce Scaled Diversity Scoring:** Replace binary rules with a continuous diversity score based on the ratio and magnitude of secondary spend.
- **Edge Case Rule for Moderate Spenders:**
  - **EDGE-2 (NEW):** `TotalSpend between 500 and 2000` AND `Max(spend) / SecondHighest(spend) < 3` AND `SecondHighest(spend) > 500` → **Score = +2** (72% confidence)
- **Error Feedback Loop:** Retrain rules using misclassified moderate-spend cases.
- **Ensemble Approach:** For passengers with TotalSpend 500-2000, use a weighted average of diversity rules and deck rules.

### **2. New Scoring Example for Passenger 0076_01**

| Passenger Profile | Applied Rules (v5.3 Order) | Total Score | Prediction | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0076_01** (F/18/S, Mars, No CryoSleep, Age 27.0, VIP=False, RoomService=0.0, FoodCourt=147.0, ShoppingMall=0.0, Spa=1018.0, VRDeck=0.0) | **IMB-2 (-1.5 for 3 zeros)** → **DIV-2 (+1)** → **MARS-SP-1 (+1)** → TRAPPIST-DEST-2 (+1) → **DECK-F-1 (-1 after diversity adjustment)** | **+0.5** | **True** | **71%** |

*Confidence calculated as weighted average: DIV-2 (70%) and MARS-SP-1 (65%) influence positively.*

---

### **3. Recalibrated Confidence & Implementation Plan**

- **Immediate Action:** Deploy v5.3 with new rules DIV-2 and MARS-SP-1, and modified IMB-2 and DECK-F-1. Reprocess the batch; 0076_01 now predicts **True (71% Confidence)**.
- **Monitoring:** Alert for passengers with `TotalSpend 500-2000` and `SecondHighest(spend) > 300` to ensure diversity rules trigger appropriately.
- **Validation:** Re-evaluate historical predictions where `TotalSpend < 2000` and `Max(spend)/SecondHighest(spend) < 5`.
- **Long-term:** Develop a continuous diversity score feature to replace threshold-based rules.

This update ensures moderate spenders with good diversity are correctly classified, reducing false negatives while maintaining accuracy on true high-risk cases.
