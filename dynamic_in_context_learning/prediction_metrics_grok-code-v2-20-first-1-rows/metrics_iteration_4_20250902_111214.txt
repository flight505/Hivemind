PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 4
============================================================

**Updated Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: If HomePlanet = Earth and CryoSleep = False and RoomService > 700 → Transported = False (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: If CryoSleep = True → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 3: If VIP = True → Transported = False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 4: If Age < 20 and RoomService > 0 → Transported = True (confidence: low)
- Rule 5: If HomePlanet = Europa and FoodCourt > 5000 → Transported = True (confidence: medium)

**Updated Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 65%
- HomePlanet: Earth → 80% transport probability
- HomePlanet: Earth and CryoSleep = False and RoomService > 700 → 0% transport probability
- CryoSleep: True → 100% transport probability
- VIP: False → 70% transport probability
- VIP: True → 0% transport probability

**Updated Critical Patterns:**
- Earth passengers with CryoSleep = False and RoomService > 700 → Transported = False (high confidence)
- Europa passengers with high Spa/VRDeck spending → Transported = False (high confidence)
- Europa passengers with high FoodCourt spending (>5000) → Transported = True (medium confidence)
- Passengers with all amenity spend = 0 in CryoSleep = False → Transported = False (medium confidence)
