PREDICTIVE METRICS - ITERATION 0
============================================================

**Predictive Rules:**
- Rule 1: If HomePlanet = Earth → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 2: If CryoSleep = True → Transported = True (confidence: high)
- Rule 3: If VIP = True → Transported = False (confidence: medium)
- Rule 4: If Age < 20 and RoomService > 0 → Transported = True (confidence: low)

**Key Probabilities:**
- Baseline transport rate: 70%
- HomePlanet: Earth → 100% transport probability
- HomePlanet: Europa → 25% transport probability
- CryoSleep: True → 100% transport probability
- CryoSleep: False → 62% transport probability
- VIP: False → 70% transport probability
- VIP: True → 0% transport probability

**Critical Patterns:**
- Earth passengers with CryoSleep = False and mixed amenities spending → Transported = True (high confidence)
- Europa passengers with high Spa/VRDeck spending → Transported = False (high confidence)
- Passengers with all amenity spend = 0 in CryoSleep = False → Transported = False (medium confidence)
